I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US ON THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH.
IT INVOLVES VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW AT THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
ALSO, WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL.
I WILL BE WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR YOUR RESPONSE.
FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC, ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION.
AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY BEHAVE IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS.
AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND FOR INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAY.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE FAMOUS, THEY ARE JUST NORMAL PEOPLE THAT DESERVE TO HAVE A PRIVATE LIFE WITHOUT JOURNALISTS AND FANS FOLLOWING THEM ALL THE TIME, AND ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE HAVE TO LEARN TO RESPECT THE THE RIGHT OF THE FAMOUS TO KEEP THEIR PERSONAL LIVES SECRET.
IN MY OPINION FAMOUS PEOPLE ARE BEING OBLIGED TO PAY A PRICE FOR BEING FAMOUS THAT, IN SOME CASES, COSTS MORE THAN THEY DESERVE TO PAY.
I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip.
Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it.
Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science.
That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea.
However, my class and I have seen an advertisement for a fashion and leisure show.
We are attracted to this show and would like to go.
Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.
This show is on the 14th March.
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and will start at ten o'clock and finish at five o'clock in the evening.
Apparently, this show is free to all students, which means if we went, the cost of the trip would be reduced.
I think it is a great opportunity because it is based on fashion.
We like to keep up with the trends but I think it will help those who want to become fashion designers later on.
There will be lots of differences in our homes of the future from our homes now, but there may also be a lot of similarities.
For one, the future home might not be built out of bricks at all! It may be built out of a stronger substance or a more attractive one, such as glass.
Non-breakable glass.
Also, due to global warming, sea levels might rise and the risk of flooding will also rise.
Therefore, houses will be built on high supports.
All domestic appliances such as showers, kettles, lights, TV and curtains may be voice activated.
Incredibly high security will prevent robbery.
Regarding the programme you have organised, everything that you have planned is a great idea, but I would like to suggest something that the students saw in an advertisement.
On Wednesday after we have visited the National Art Gallery, we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon.
The advertisement that the students saw is for a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need to cancel the tour on Tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00.
Nowadays the main attraction in the newspapers and on television is the private lives of famous people.
It is really interesting how people like to know about famous people's lives.
Without someone famous knowing, photographers take pictures secretly, and try to get money for them.
Sometimes being famous can get stressful, because everywhere they go there are people around them, especially journalists, trying to ask millions of questions.
Famous people deserve to have freedom to do whatever they want, but it is quite difficult to do things in public places, because nobody likes seeing famous politicians or film stars without asking questions.
On the whole, being rich and famous doesn't always bring happiness, whereas the majority of the population wish they were rich and famous.
Thank you for organising a good programme, we especially like in London for three days.
I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give you the information about 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go to and to offer our opinion.
We have seen an advertisement in last Saturday's 'The Times' edition of the show.
It will be held in Central Exhibition Hall, London on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00.
Firstly, it will introduce the latest fashions Millennium.
Secondly, we will be able .
It would be a fantastic opportunity for the students who study fashion.
Finally, we can see how to do make-up and create better hairstyles in the show.
Most of all, it is free for students to enter.
Whenever I recollect it, I feel self-confident.
When I was twenty years old, I had to go into the Army.
As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea).
However, instead of going into the Army, I was able to apply to join the Korea Auxiliary Police.
One year later, I was working in Kang-nam police station in Seoul.
Suddenly, the burglar alarm came on.
So, another policeman and I had to arrive at the accident place quickly.
When we arrived at the place where it happened, one man started running away.
Without any thought, I ran quickly like a swallow.
Then, he tried to go over the wall, I held his leg.
He fell down and we had to stare at each other.
After we fought for a minute, I was able to arrest him.
As a result, I could go on vacation.
When I told my mother, she asked me not to do it again.
But, I was a policeman.
Therefore, I had to do it in spite of it being dangerous.
On behalf of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a gallery.
However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It is on the 13th of March from 10.00 to 19.00.
It is a famous exhibition, where the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles are shown.
We are all very interested in the show because English people have a different kind of life.
It is also unusual to have such a great opportunity in our country.
Would it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping and to replace them with the London Show? We could go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of in the afternoon during our free time.
I hope you will consider my request.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I had always wanted to swim with sharks.
I lived in a small village on the ocean.
My father was a captain on a huge boat.
When I was a child, I used to go with him travelling from harbour to harbour.
I grew up and I couldn't live without it.
Once I was fishing when sharks appeared all around me.
I got the strange feeling I could jump and follow them.
Since this experience, I dreamt about that every night.
One Saturday I got into my motorboat and rode far away from the reef.
My father was sitting next to me, thinking that I was crazy.
Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks.
I'm writing to you concerning the London trip that my English class is going to go on in March.
First of all I want to thank you for the excellent programme that you arranged for my class in such a short time.
The students are especially happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to make on Tuesday morning on 14th March.
The point of my letter is that the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and they would appreciate it if they could go and see the show.
The show is going to include the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles and best of all it is free for students to get in.
The only problem is that the show is going to take place on Tuesday 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes to your programme.
My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because Tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be .
We suggest swapping shopping on Tuesday with the free time on Wednesday, so we can see the show on Tuesday afternoon.
I hope that this matter isn't going to cause you any problems and we hope for an answer as soon as possible.
That is a question which many people ask themselves and other people quite often.
Technology is changing very fast and at the same time as I'm writing my article about the future maybe technologists have made a new oven which co-operates with your refrigerator and has a program to make dinner for you every day without you having to do anything.
I think that everyone should think not just about the positive side of technology but also the negative.
Thank you for giving us the chance to visit London.
We are all excited about the programme you've prepared for us, especially about visiting the National Art gallery.
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show in a newspaper.
Will we all live in the countryside in houses surrounded by forest full of animal life? Or would our house itself be alive? With new computer technology nothing is impossible.
A scientist could discover the 4th dimension and we'd get unlimited space inside the house.
It is already possible that very soon all household appliances will be voice-controlled.
You could tell your wardrobe what clothes you'd like to wear, your hob will cook your favourite meals and your refrigerator will send orders to the supermarkets to buy the food.
Lots of changes could occur in the future, but the main purpose of the home - to provide comfort and safety, a place for you to relax and feel at home - will remain.
It is a pleasure to write to you and we want to thank you for organising a school trip to London.
We have seen the programme and we all think it will be enjoyable.
the science museum because we are all doing science in school.
Recently, some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London.
It will be on the 14th and we all want to go.
So, it would be great if you could give us this opportunity to watch the show.
We are all looking forward to your answer.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it, because there was a man who had had a serious car accident and I was walking past him.
Nobody had noticed him because it happened at night and the car had actually crashed into the bushes.
I was thinking 'what should I do?' I hadn't got my mobile phone with me and I was halfway between my school and home.
At that time he was unconscious.
I kept asking myself 'Should I wake him up or try to use my dubious first aid skills to help with him." I was struggling because I knew if I didn't help him, he would die in a short time.
I decided to do something for this man.
My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways.
And I checked his .
After that I turned on the car's lights in order to warn the passing cars.
I ran back home for help.
I phoned the police and told them the whole story.
A strange thing happened to me, when I got back to that man.
The car and the man were not there anymore.
Where could they be? I was wondering.
Oh, sorry they were not on this road.
They were on the road.
I am writing to thank you for the interesting and excellent programme that you have organised, and especially for the opportunity to visit the National Art Gallery and the Science Museum.
I am also writing to ask for your permission to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be on Tuesday 14 March.
It will be a presentation of the latest fashions and of leisure and sports wear.
Moreover there will be a of modern make-up and new different, hairstyles.
I would like to add that it would definitely be a great opportunity because the tickets will be free for students.
Finally, I would like to suggest that we could attend the show after visiting the Science Museum, instead of going shopping.
Many thanks in advance for your cooperation.
I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it," Peter whispered, smiling at me.
It was a cold, stormy, winter's night outside.
The wind was blowing and the heavy rain was drumming against our bedroom window.
I could hear an owl hooting in the tree nearby.
My husband and I were sitting on our bed.
Peter, my husband, was a tall, strong man in his mid-forties.
We used to recount our day before falling asleep.
As a postman, Peter had to deliver letters around our little village.
He knew everybody, including Mrs Rilke, an elderly, eagle-eyed retired teacher, who lived in an old cottage with her five bad-tempered dogs.
She had never received any letters, till that morning.
I am writing to let you know about some comments and suggestions from some students about the trip you have organized to London.
First of all, we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show which takes place from Monday 13th to Wednesday 15th.
It is open from 10:00 to 19:00 and it is for free for students.
This is a great opportunity because we can learn more about leisure and fashion in this city.
If you allow us to go we could change the programme in the following way.
Firstly, on Monday morning we can visit the presentation of the latest fashions and in the afternoon we could take a sightseeing bus.
Secondly, on Tuesday morning we can see the leisure wear and sportswear and in the afternoon we can go to the Science Museum and finally, on Wednesday, we can go and see the presentation of different hairstyles and make-up, spending the afternoon in the National Art Gallery.
We hope you will consider our suggestions and let us know your answer.
On the one hand, we will be able to spend more time with our family and not be worried about anything.
No more housework, no more stress, no more illnesses; everything will be perfect.
On the other hand, life will be boring, a large amount of workers will be redundant and housewives will not have anything to do, which will be extremely boring and tedious.
What do you prefer? Do you enjoy doing nothing or do you really enjoy what you do? It is your decision.
I AM WRITING WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING VERY SOON.
I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY GROUP, AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING US ABROAD.
WE HAVE SEEN THE ACTIVITIES PROGRAMME ALREADY AND WE THINK IT IS EXCITING, ESPECIALLY THE VISIT TO THE SCIENCE MUSEUM.
AT THE SAME TIME, WE WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.
THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW IS GOING TO BE ON THE 14TH OF MARCH, FROM 10.00 TO 19.00.
WE ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SHOW.
EVEN THOUGH YOUR PROGRAMME IS PERFECT, WE WOULD PREFER TO GO THERE.
WE THINK IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY, BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT KIND OF SHOW IN THIS CITY.
IN CASE YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE THE PROGRAMME, WE SUGGEST GOING TO THE SHOW ON TUESDAY AND ON WEDNESDAY, INSTEAD OF FREE TIME, VISITING THE SCIENCE MUSEUM.
.
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER.
MAY 29, 1997.
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME IN LONDON.
THAT NIGHT, I WENT TO A PUB IN BAYSWATER.
WHEN THEY CLOSED, I TOOK THE NUMBER 7 BUS.
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE CORNER OF MY STREET.
BUT THAT DAY, AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK, I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE.
SO, WHEN I NOTICED IT, THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF, BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO.
I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS, BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY.
I WAS REALLY SCARED.
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE AROUND BUT I WAS AFRAID TO ASK THEM THE WAY .
FINALLY I ASKED A BOY AND HE SAID "I'LL TELL YOU WHERE THE PLACE YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS, JUST FOLLOW ME".
IT WAS DANGEROUS, BUT I KNEW I HAD TO DO IT.
AFTER FILLOWING HIM , I STARTED TO RECOGNISE THE PLACE, AND I WAS FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE.
HE TOOK ME RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE.
I THANKED HIM VERY MUCH, AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO ME.
I am writing to you with a request for a change in the schedule of our trip to London.
But, first of all, I would like to thank you for the time and the effort you have put in to organize the entire programme.
Everything seams very interesting and I am sure that we will all have a very good time.
Unfortunately I have to suggest a change for the programme for Tuesday the 14th of March.
That's because the "Fashion and Leisure Show" takes place that day in London.
All of the students - including myself - think of this as a great opportunity that it would be a pity to miss, especially when students can enter for free.
According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon.
My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative to the shopping.
This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show.
I hope that you will .
I had to test my limits once again.
This is my nature.
I had to see how far I could go this time or, to be more specific, how high! I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, myself free, to shake from excitement.
These were my thoughts when I first saw the advertisement for a "skydive".
I didn't hesitate much.
The same afternoon I picked up the phone and I gave them a call.
That was it.
Well, danger is in my nature and Life is nothing but an adventure.
I'm a student at your college and I am writing this letter for my class because I'm the class chief.
In the hall outside our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show if that is possible.
We know that we will spend three days in London in a with a programme.
First of all we thank you for the excellent programme and especially for the visit to the Science Museum on Tuesday 14th.
Regarding the London Fashion and Leisure Show we would be very excited to go because it's an and unusual show with leisure, sportswear and hairstyles.
As I see from your programme, the shopping trip is at the same time as the London Fashion Show so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to the Central Exhibition Hall without doing any shopping.
It would be a great opportunity because it's free for students.
.
I don't think that my house is the house of the future.
It is comfortable, not too big with a lot of carpets and antique objects, for example, pottery, my bed, and a wardrobe of my grandmother's.
I think people's homes will be different in the future.
Regarding , they will have a lot of computers for and doing the shopping while you are at home.
We will have a relaxing room, with soft light, New Age music and a lot of essences.
I think that we can't stop progress but if we want we can conserve traditional things.
The home of the future will be very impersonal and the atmosphere will be cold and very .
I'm a student in an English class which is going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm the student representative from my class to thank you for the programme that you've organised for us.
It's really wonderful, especially the River trip to Greenwich.
We feel we can't wait until that time.
However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will be on 14th March between 10.00 to 19.00 at the Central Exhibition Hall, London.
The show has many interesting such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and Hairstyles and we are all agreed that it's a great opportunity for us because most of us are going to study on a Fashion and Design course next term and the other students are also interested in new fashions.
So we think that it will be useful for all of us.
I'm looking forward to your programme.
I believe that everyone in this world has curiosity.
We always want to know about others' lives, especially the famous - even the ones that we hate.
But we have to accept that everyone has their private life.
For example, when we get married or when a policeman stops us on the highway, we don't want any stranger to notice what is happening to us.
Famous people are also normal people like us.
Just because their by everybody, it doesn't mean that we can invade their privacy.
They also want to have some special time with their family or their friends.
It's not fair for them to have journalists following them and taking their photographs, and some journalists write reports that are not true.
We also can't deny that the journalists' job is to know what's going on with these famous people.
But it doesn't mean that they have to follow these stars all the time.
They should give them some privacy.
On the other hand, these stars should accept that they are famous people so everyone wants to know about their life.
The best way is if they, the famous stars and the journalists, compromise and respect each other's rights.
I am writing to express the desire of all the students in my class to visit the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW at the Central Exhibition Hall, on Tuesday 14 March.
All the students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show.
I think that will be a very good event, especially the part about the Latest Fashions, because it is something which affects people of all ages today.
But also the other parts of the show seem to be very interesting.
Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting.
I think that young people are affected by that in the way they dress.
Make-up and Hairstyles are also very important, especially For our class, because most of the students in our class are girls.
The girls are more interested than boys in make-up and hairstyles and they want to know all the latest news about these things.
Thank you very much.
I apologise For any inconvenience and I am waiting for your reply.
I think that they have a right because they are also people like you or like me and they should have a private life.
A private life is very important for everyone, because your job creates stress and you should rest and recharge your batteries For the next day.
If journalists are following your every step it is difficult to have a private life.
On the other hand, I believe that Journalists are doing their job, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and they are always following Famous people in order to discover something new about their lives.
Another thing is the pressure from and the difficulty For someone to Find a job these days.
 want to maximize their profits and always press the journalists to Find something new.
To conclude journalists should do their work but without annoying other people.
A private life is everyone's right and we should all respect that.
I am writing with reference to the three-day trip to London.
Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting.
In particular, the sightseeing by bus should be enjoyable.
However, my classmates and I also found another fascinating thing about the trip.
There is 'The London Fashion and Leisure Show' at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th of March, which shows the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
We all found it exciting and exhilarating.
It is a great opportunity to see the show because we are keen on fashions and clothes.
In addition, students can go without paying any fees.
Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March.
We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping.
We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon during our free time.
I would be grateful if you could our concern and change the programme on 14th of March.
First of all, I think they should accept the fact that they are well known and they should be observed all the time, as we are curious to know what they do and we love to gossip about others.
Moreover, it might be a good thing that scandals usually increase their fame, even if they do something wrong.
On the other hand, it is also said that their private lives must not be intruded on, as they are the same as us, human beings.
It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life.
To sum up, although I think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
The whole class and I would like to thank you for the good programme which you have organised for our trip to London.
I hope you will understand .
The class and I are looking forward to hearing from you.
In the next few years people's homes will be changing a lot.
The first point is we will use more often new technologies like telecommunications or the Internet.
In the future .
That means for example, while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer.
You can open and close the windows and switch the light on and off.
Your freezer tells you when you have to buy some milk, eggs or cheese.
Or, without leaving the office, you are able to heat the water for a hot bath.
So in fact people's homes will become more convenient and more comfortable.
I think also housewives will receive more help with a robot in the home.
But the form and the rooms of a building will still be the same.
And of course the furniture of people's homes will not change either.
 Monday 13 March will be .
The morning visiting interesting places in the City and in the afternoon make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent.
Because the London Fashion Show takes place on Tuesday, I would suggest changing your plan.
There is a very interesting programme for young people like us.
They will show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, several additional attractions.
It would be if you would agree to change your plan.
The last day, Wednesday 15 March, will surely be very interesting because the National Art Gallery is a very famous place in London.
It happened on a very lovely day in summer.
The sun was shining, the Channel was clear blue and I was walking by the sea.
Suddenly I heard somebody crying for help.
Not I ran as fast as I could directly to where I heard the voice .
I knew I couldn't swim so I realized it might be dangerous for me as well.
But at this particular moment it wasn't important to me.
The most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old, who was in the water without his parents and couldn't swim.
It was difficult for me because I am afraid of water.
However I went quickly to him and took him in my arms.
He was exhausted and couldn't breathe.
In the meantime a man told me he was a doctor and could help the boy.
I was very happy that I managed to save the life of the boy.
Now, when I consider the events, it's clear to me that if I got there a few minutes later it probably would have been too late.
You should ignore the danger if you are convinced you can save somebody's life.
I am writing with reference to the programme for the English class that is going to spend three days in London.
I have already read the programme, and I like it, I think that the class will like going sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going on the river trip to Greenwich.
Also, they can visit the Science Museum, and they can go  shopping.
On Wednesday 15 March they are going to visit the National Art Gallery, really, I think that is a good programme.
However, I think that the class would like to visit "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" as well, it is on Tuesday from 10.00 am until 19.00 pm.
They don't need to pay.
 I think it is a good a idea, because they could go shopping afterwards, when they have some free time.
I am sure about that, they will want to visit that place.
The programme could be changed just for a few hours, it is a great opportunity for everybody.
Finally, I hope that you understand my personal opinion about the programme, I will understand and accept your personal opinion as well.
I look forward to hearing from you.
My personal opinion about famous people, is that their lives are good in one way and bad in another way.
I think that they live their life like that, because they want to live this life.
They do everything just for money, and sometimes they can make their life easier than it would normally be.
It is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them money, and a comfortable life.
Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, live happily because they know that being famous means being rich.
They can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be very good people, because " Fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
My personal opinion is that I think they aren't really happy, and they are selfish as well.
I would not really like to be a famous person, because you are not really yourself, and for me that is the most important thing.
I am writing to you concerning the three days which we are going to spend in London.
I would like to thank you for the programme which you have organised for our English class.
It sounds very promising, especially the trip to Greenwich.
But there is something else which we would like to see.
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go there.
It would be a great opportunity for us, because we are all interested in fashion, particularly in sportswear.
The show is going to be in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March from 10.00-19.00.
Entry for students is free.
I would suggest visiting the Science Museum, which we were going to do on Tuesday, on Wednesday afternoon.
So that we can go to the Fashion Show.
And if there is anybody who wants to go shopping, he will be able to do it on Wednesday evening.
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it.
For just one day in my summer holidays I planned to do something adventurous.
The moment I saw the advertisement about one of the seven wonders of the world, I knew I had to see it.
But this was also the moment when my nightmare started to come true.
My friend and I had just arrived at a small airport in the middle of the Californian desert.
A man came out from a small building.
It was our pilot.
He introduced himself and we walked towards a small plane.
The doors of the plane were so thin that I thought I could have torn them.
We went inside and the plane took off.
It was horrible.
I could feel every movement which was caused by or wind.
I thought we would die.
But then, finally, we reached the Grand Canyon.
I didn't know what to feel.
It was amazing.
We were so near that, I thought I could touch the sides of the Grand Canyon by reaching out of the plane's window.
I swore to myself I would never ever fly in a plane like this again.
It was too dangerous, but I knew deep inside I had to see it.
I am Margherita X from class 3C, who are going to spend three days in London.
We had the opportunity to read your programme and we are happy because it is very well organized.
We especially like the idea of going to the National Art gallery.
Thank you.
With this letter I would like to ask you if you would change it because we saw in the London Advertiser an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
The show is on Tuesday, March 14th, from 10.00-19.00 in the Central Exhibition Hall.
They are going to show the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and new hairstyles.
We all think that it would be a good opportunity to see this show.
We are young and we are all interested in fashion.
It is free for students.
We thought that we could change the programme this way: we could go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday.
I really hope that you are going to consider our request.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
It was a normal Saturday morning.
My mam was cooking and my dad was sitting in his chair reading a book.
I knew that my brother was at home, although I didn't know where he was.
I was doing my homework when I heard an explosion.
I came out of my room and I saw my brother on fire.
He was playing with fire and alcohol in the bathroom.
My first reaction was to him on the floor so that the fire could be put out.
He was screaming because he was in such great pain.
We were shocked; none of us knew what to do.
I called a taxi because my father wasn't able to drive.
We went to the hospital and they treated him.
He had to stay there for three long weeks.
Since that bad experience he has never played with fire again.
I really love my brother and I would do anything possible to save him.
I'm writing to you in the name of all the students who will go on the London trip.
First of all thank you very much for your programme, it sounds very interesting and everybody is looking forward to it.
 However, we do all have a request to put to you.
As teenagers we're all very keen on fashion so it will be a great opportunity to go because in our , we'll never get a chance to see a show like that.
What we are suggesting is to change the programme on the afternoon of March the 14th.
Instead of going shopping, we could go to the show.
Anyway, as students we don't have much money to spend on shopping and the good thing is that it won't affect your budget at all as the entrance fees are free for students.
We hope you consider our request which would be much appreciated by the class.
I know that everyone is excited about what happened at Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of the United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit too far.
Those movie stars or politicians may have a lot of money, may do whatever they want but what is the price to pay? Would you like to live a life like that, every time you make a wrong step, the whole world is looking at you, judging you? It must be very exhausting to have the media around you day and night because you can't be yourself, you have to show your best side and character.
In my opinion there should be a rule which lets the media approach famous people almost anywhere except in their private home to leave them at least one place to feel safe.
Many thanks for the programme you have organised.
It is really interesting and diverse at the same time.
There is just one thing I want to tell you: Janine and Richey have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show and we all would like to go to the show.
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall, near the hotel, and it is all about fashion: the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
I think it could be very interesting and it is free for students (which is really good).
It is a great opportunity because this show is only every two years and normally it is difficult to .
And, as you know we all are interested in fashion.
 I would suggest going to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time.
Or going to the show on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon, we can choose between free time or the National Art Gallery.
I look forward to hearing from you.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I went out of the room, ran as far as I could and started thinking about what this man was doing here and who he was.
When I arrived in the street it was dark and windy, but I could see a shadow at the corner of the street opposite.
By the time I arrived there, he had disappeared.
Suddenly, I felt very tired and decided to go home.
My sister was standing, crying and the front door.
I took her in my arms and opened the door: my mother was sitting in a chair, reading a book, with blood all around her.
I finally realized that she was dead.
The police arrived twenty minutes later, took my mother and checked to see what could be useful to find the murderer: luckily, the knife which he used to kill her was still there and in fact they were able to arrest him.
They found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister to a small house in the countryside.
Everything was going , when one day, I went into the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her.
On behalf of my class, I am writing to request a few changes in our London programme which has already been planned.
My friends have seen an advertisement which is for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It will be held on 14th March.
We have decided it would be more interesting to see the latest fashions, make-up, and hairstyles than going to do shopping.
We would suggest going to this show.
It is also free of charge for students.
We will be given a great opportunity to have fun and look around in London.
We all thank you for the organised programme.
We spend most of our life in our houses.
We like them to show our lifestyle and of course feel comfortable.
I can imagine in the future how it would be.
It would be much more technological and far less complex.
It could be as simple as we think but the of the lifestyle depends on the person.
On the other hand, it would not be changed.
Somehow I could say that the main appliances would retain the same working structure.
such as a triangular talking oven.
Despite being used in many ways, it could entertain us as well.
On balance I would accept whatever could make my life easier to live.
I wouldn't mind having things talking around me.
It would be enjoyable to have virtual friends in my house.
Although I imagine them in my house in my future, I am sure I would be surprised if I had them.
I am writing on behalf of my English class.
We have just seen the programme you prepared for our three-day trip to London.
Thank you very much for the many interesting in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are sure, will be very exciting.
I would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we have found it very interesting.
There will be a lot of latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be a great opportunity, because entrance is free for students.
The event is planned for the 14th of March between 10.00 and 19.00.
If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme.
We would be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon.
We have checked that it is open every day.
As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be a nice reward for our work during this year.
I would be grateful if you would consider our suggestions.
Suddenly I heard a noise from my garden and I wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to .
The outside lights were broken and I couldn't see anything.
My dog was very angry.
I was afraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get into my house.
After a few minutes I heard steps near my kitchen window.
I was very frightened, but I knew that I had to do something.
I had no time to call anyone and I had to go to my kitchen to see what it was.
I stood against the window and I started to listen.
I was sure there was someone on the other side of the wall.
It was terrible.
I thought that it was the last day of my life.
Suddenly someone broke my window.
I had no time to think.
I grabbed one of the pots and hit him on his head.
One moment later I called the police.
He was a thief, who had been looked for for many years.
First, all the students and I would like to thank you for this great idea of a trip to London for three days.
The programme is very exciting and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
, all the class have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", and we are all interested in seeing this show, this is why I am writing to you.
In fact this is a great opportunity because we certainly will not have again the chance to take part in a live show, like this one.
, students don't pay the entrance fee.
The show is on the 14th from 10.00 to 19.00, so I suggest going to the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday, and just having two or three hours' free time after the museum.
This is the arrangement that we with the other students and everyone agreed.
I look forward to hearing some news from you.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
The survival of my family depended on me.
We were a poor family, five people living in one room.
My father died during the war and my mother stayed alone with four children.
We hadn't enough money to buy food or new clothes and the worst was that my youngest brother was terribly ill, and without money we couldn't take him to a doctor.
So, one day I decided to rob the bank.
For weeks, I had prepared my plan, trying not to forget anything important.
Everything was ready and I was too.
So I knew that the day after would be the right one.
I got up very early.
All the city was sleeping.
The weather was cold.
When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster.
A few days before, I had found a little window at the back of the building, so I entered in this way and by chance I just arrived in the vault.
I hadn't ever seen so much money.
I took it, and went out the same way.
I ran to my house and went back to my bed to sleep a little bit.
When all the family got up, I told the truth and they all promised to say nothing.
It was our family's secret.
I am writing to ask for some information about the programme which our class would like to join.
There are a few questions which I have asked myself.
First of all, would you give me an explaination about the London fashion and Leisure show? We think that the show might be a great opportunity for most of us who are interested in fashion and leisure.
In addition, I would like to get your suggestion about how the programme could be changed on the second day of the trip so that we could enjoy going to both the Science Museum and the London fashion and leisure show.
I am grateful to you for offering a well-organised programme, especially, the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in.
yours sincerely.
In the middle ages, nobody expected to have electrical goods which would help to do housework.
It made women free from drudgery, so that they could utilize time for improving themselves.
As a result, we can observe that the homes of the present have a lot of machines which make home like a factory.
By contrast, in the future, I guess we would rather go back to the ancient We will be unwilling to give housework away.
Being at home doing housework, taking care of their children, might be the purpose of the future life.
Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we are writing this letter to you is because we would like to thank you for this short trip to London.
We believe that the programme is very good and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time for that.
The exhibition is called the London Fashion and Leisure Show and it takes place at the Central Exhibition hall, in London, From 10.00 till 19.00.
The class is very excited about that because the Show covers the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make-up and hairstyles.
We believe that this is a great opportunity because it is one of the best shows of the year.
Also the majority of the class has never had the chance to visit a show like this and the most important and best part is that admission is Free for Students.
And that we thought very good as otherwise we could not afford it.
So please if it is possible could we make a small change to the programme and move the activities of Tuesday the 14th of March to the 15th of March so as to try to combine the 2 days.
"FAME" What a word!! I'm sure that the people that did not realise that there is a price to pay.
I believe that all famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time for various reasons.
First of all they are humans like everyone else, so yes everyone wants privacy in their lives.
It is the same right for all of us as human beings.
I would like to thank you for organising a nice programme for us.
In particular, going to the Museum and the Art Gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us, as they are world-famous places in London.
However, there is something I need to ask you.
Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m.
At the show, we will be able to see the latest fashions - leisure- and sports-wear, make-up and hairstyles.
It is essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future.
Entrance is free for students so the show is well worth seeing.
To go to the show, we need to alter the programme.
The show is on 14th and lasts a whole day.
So, if we could go to the Museum by using the free time on 15th it would be okay although we could not go shopping.
Three years ago, when I was in Japan, my parents were both working and neither of them were at home by the time I got back from school.
I always had my own key and unlocked the door by myself.
I am glad about the three-day trip to London.
I have seen your itinerary for the trip.
It is really interesting.
My classmates and I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really want to see that.
This is the reason that I'm writing to you.
The show is on 14th March on Tuesday.
That is the second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning and lasts until 19.00.
My friends told me that if we wake up early on Tuesday we can go to the Science Museum at about 8.00 in the morning.
Your afternoon plan is to go shopping but we can do our shopping on Wednesday afternoon because we will have some free time on Wednesday.
I'd like to tell you something about the show.
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and it is free for students.
It is a great opportunity for us because when we go there we will learn about the latest fashions news, we will see leisure and sports wear, allthe new make-up designers () and different hairstyles.
We are also enthusiastic about and the River trip to Greenwich on Monday and visiting the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.
I hope you will consider our suggestion about the trip.
I guess there will be more gadgets to make housework easier.
Maybe there will be some robots to do our ironing, wash our dishes, clean everywhere, hoover, etc.
Will it make life easier? Maybe yes, maybe no.
Of course these gadgets will do our hard housework but we will get lazy, we will lose the skills that we have now.
Now IT (information technology) is our life.
We can get everything we want to know from computers.
It means we don't need to go anywhere to get the information we need.
We'll be stuck to our computers at home.
Whatever we need we order via the computer and someone will bring it.
It means we'll lose our social life.
But we can't stop these technological improvements.
We should use them in positive ways.
When people use technology they should know that it is not everything.
They should seek another life outside their homes.
I guess that with technology people will spend much more of their life in their homes.
It doesn't seem right to me.
Our homes should just protect us from dangers from outside.
But I believe humans will never forget what they used to be.
Mankind has always been seeking different things.
We are learning a lot of things about life and we are these things.
In the future life will be more artificial than it was .
Our homes will probably be smaller than now, because the human population is growing quickly and people prefer to stay in big cities (like London, New York, Paris).
It means there will be too many people in small areas.
Then they will build smaller houses, flats, buildings, etc.
Outside big cities there won't be any people at all.
Those areas will just be used for agriculture.
Beyond the near future maybe our homes will be in outer space.
They will be spaceships.
We'll travel around space.
It is just an idea.
We live in a changing world.
Like everything our homes will change as well.
I need some more information about the programme.
Because my class want to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show during your programme and we need some timetables and to go there.
You didn't tell us any details about how much the ticket costs to go inside.
Thank you and enjoy a fantastic programme.
If I tell something .
.
For study my college is really amazing.
I think my story can tell you about my college and you .
Thank you very much for organising the programme of our three-day visit to London.
The programme looks very good, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme for our trip.
We have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go to the show.
We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students.
We would suggest replacing the shopping trip on Tuesday afternoon with the visit to the show.
We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometime later.
Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change to the programme.
We are sure this is suitable for all of us.
Thank you very much.
The view from outside will mainly be the same.
The houses will look like the houses of today.
A simple and well-proven architecture.
The difference will be inside the buildings.
The doors would be the entrance to another world....
The fridge, the television, the stove and the hi-fi equipment will be attached to a computer network.
Every electronic gadget in the future home will be able to communicate with other machines or computers.
It will be possible to connect to the Internet from nearly everywhere in the house or flat.
I'm sure all the things which are based on electronic parts will totally change.
Also the aspects of security within people's homes.
But I think there will not be many changes concerning the furnishing of the future homes.
All the big and small things which define people's personal environment will be left nearly unchanged - the furniture, the pictures on the wall....
I am writing to you, on behalf of all the students in my class, to tell you about our wish to change the London programme.
I would also like to thank you for the excellent programme you organized for us, and in particular the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating.
I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which is going to take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00.
The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown on this occasion.
We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes place only once a year and, on top of all that, it is free for students.
We suggest going to the show on Tuesday afternoon instead of going shopping (something that we can do on Wednesday afternoon, in our free time).
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I had absolutely no choice.
We had walked for three hours (my mother, my two brothers and I) through the humid and noisy jungle, looking forward to reaching a small but clean house where a nice and friendly family, old friends of ours, used to live.
The path we were walking on was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed...
until we reached a river.
There was neither a bridge nor a canoe.
The only way to cross it was by walking on a big old tree trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only bridge between our side and the other.
My mother and brothers had already crossed the river, and they were encouraging me to do the same from the other side of it, but I was paralysed with fear.
Then, I suddenly realised that I had no choice, so I summoned all my courage, took a big deep breath, and crossed it! It was easier than I had thought! That day, I learnt that I can even do things which, at first sight, seem impossible to do.
I am writing to you about your advertisement for the "London Fashion" and "Leisure Show".
Thank you for organising this excellent programme, especially the Leisure show, which is very interesting to us.
So all of our class would like to go to the show during their three days in London.
But there is a problem which I hope you can solve.
I think it is a great opportunity because I am sure we will enjoy ourselves.
But I wonder if the timetable could be changed, which would be perfect.
As you know, all of us want to the programme, so if some students go to the Science Museum, they will miss the wonderful show.
For that reason, I suggest that you could change the activities.
In my opinion, we would be better going to the show instead of the science museum and .
Also we can go to the Science Museum on 15th March, instead of having some free time in the afternoon.
I am sorry to cause you inconvenience.
I hope it doesn't cause any trouble if you accept my suggestion.
I look forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible.
Last night, when I went into my house it was quite silent.
I felt there might be something that had gone wrong.
I found my parents sitting .
I could see sadness in my father's eyes.
My mother came over to me and said softly, "My dear, your father's company has just gone bankrupt', then she couldn't help crying.
When I heard this bad news, I was very depressed because father worked quite hard for his company.
My father always remembered his responsibility was to provide his workers with a good salary, which is the aim of his life.
So I must find a way to help my great father.
One day, I suddenly had a good idea.
'Why not go to the stock exchange?' I said to myself.
Almost every day I went there and researched the exchange decline-line, which gave me lots of information .
Finally, I decided to join in the dangerous game, which meant losing everything or suddenly becoming a millionaire.
With luck, I won .
I am writing on behalf of our class to thank you for organising our trip to London.
Our class is very grateful to you for the excellent programme.
We are especially interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon.
It is a good idea to include the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery in the morning on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.
However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m.
All of us would like to go to the show.
It is a great opportunity for the following reasons.
Firstly, there will be leisure and sports wear and the latest fashions.
Secondly, there will be exhibitions about makeup and hairstyles.
Moreover, entrance for students is free.
We suggest changing our programme a little bit.
Instead of Wednesday afternoon's free time we could visit the Science Museum.
And on Tuesday we will enjoy the London fashion and Leisure Show till 19.00.
After we will all be able to go shopping.
I am looking forward to receiving your positive reply.
For further details you can contact me by phone .
 In my opinion, these are the people who stay in our sight all the time.
We are interested in politicians' and film stars' clothes, hobbies, passions and intrigues.
There are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, .
In my opinion, each human being has a right to be free.
We can go for a walk, go shopping, go to the cinema, get married or divorced.
Why can't famous people do all these things? Why must everybody know and talk about their private life? The most important thing is that famous people are also normal people like us.
They live like us, they breathe and eat like us, they even fall in love like us.
I think they should have a normal private life without journalists following them all the time and without any details about them appearing in the different newspapers' .
I am writing to you on behalf of an advanced class to thank you for having organised our three-day programme from 13th to 15th March.
We discussed the programme.
It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat.
We all would love to do it.
However, we have seen an advertisement for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" recently.
It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m..
According to the advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make-up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear.
It would be a golden opportunity to see up-to-date fashion.
In addition, it is free for students.
After consideration, we would like you to reorganise the 2nd day's programme.
We are politely asking you.
It would be great if you could reorganise this at your earliest convenience.
Nowadays, a lot of celebrities, such as pop, film and sports stars, suffer from the privacy of their lives being intruded on.
Undoubtedly, their first enemies are "Journalists".
Some people are in favour of covering famous people's stories in depth, because it is interesting and they can forget about their own problems by imagining celebrities' luxurious lives.
Moreover, they think that celebrities do not have to hide from publicity because it means that they are extremely popular with people and being loved.
On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment.
They claim that it is absolutely an intrusion on their privacy.
What is more, they insist that as well as celebrities, they are also human beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched.
Thank you very much for your excellent programme! We like it very much! But we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It is on Tuesday.
We think that you would also like to go there, when you know more about it.
The latest fashions will be shown there.
Also, we will see leisure and sports wear.
We know that you want to have another and don't know which one.
If we go to the show, we will see many hairstyles.
Maybe it'll help you choose.
Also, you'll be glad to know that for students it is free! So, we think that it is very good for you and for us.
So, we can change your programme a little bit .
On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written in your programme.
On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping.
And on Wednesday morning we go to the National Art Gallery, and after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon.
I believed everything she told me.
And said just be careful.
But for three days she didn't come home.
She disappeared! We called the police.
They advised us to wait.
But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something.
After three days of the phone rang.
I picked up the phone.
Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must get 5000$ and take it out onto the street.
I took some paper, put it into a bag and without saying anything went to my friend to get something that looked like a gun.
The friend gave me his toy gun and I went onto the street.
There I saw a man and my friend.
I showed the man that I had a gun and money.
I was surprised that he believed me.
Of course, it was better for us.
I gave him the bag, took my friend's hand and we ran away.
After that she told me that the man was the boy who she had met.
I am writing on behalf of the whole class.
First of all, I want to thank you for the interesting programme which you have already organised.
It is very good, especially the sightseeing tour by bus.
However, we saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London.
There we will be able to see everything connected with the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
Entry for students is free.
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people in our class are going to work in this sector so it would be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education.
Instead of going to the Science Museum on Tuesday morning, we thought we could postpone it to Wednesday afternoon.
The shopping could be done after the river trip to Greenwich but only if we have enough time.
I hope you will agree with our suggestion and if you have any further questions do not hesitate to contact me.
Will the home of the future really look different? It's quite difficult to say, but of course there will be changes.
For example, if you look back to the forties and compare homes then with nowadays, you can see that they have become more modern, especially the equipment in the kitchen and in the living room.
In the future it is possible that you won't have to prepare your breakfast yourself , perhaps you will just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone off.
In addition to this, you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping.
Maybe they will also be your life partners.
The place to spend the night will still be the bed.
The living room won't see any big changes, although televisions, stereos and videos will become more modern and perhaps more complicated.
I have been asked by my classmates to write to you to suggest a new activity which you could include in the London programme if you like it.
We are very grateful to you for these three days that we are going to spend in the English capital, especially because you have planned very interesting and different kinds of things for all of us to do.
However, we all agree that we would like to include a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London in the trip itinerary.
I am sure that if you allow us to go, we are going to enjoy it a lot, learn new facts about English culture and have an opportunity to talk with .
It is a very good chance to attend this exhibition to see all the new fashions , the latest hairstyles and make-up as all of us come from many different countries and do not have the same customs .
As the show is held on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00 we could go there instead of going shopping in the afternoon.
way, we would visit the museum as you had planned and on Wednesday afternoon we could use the free time to do some shopping if we wished .
Well, that is all I wanted to tell you.
We do hope you like our suggestion and we can to attend the fashion exhibition.
Nevertheless, if the famous are known everywhere in the world it is because of .
If they appear often on TV or in films it is because of their popularity, a popularity which was given to them by all us.
To sum up I would like to say that for me it is very difficult to decide which group is right but, for the moment, we should try to respect each other and .
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
First of all, we'd like to thank you for the programme you have already arranged.
It's wonderful because it covers most of our interests.
But also we would like to visit The London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 - 19:00.
So we suggest doing things this way on Tuesday 14: in the morning go to the Science Museum and, instead of shopping, we could attend the London Fashion Show, because there will be the latest fashions, leisure wear, sportswear, make-up, and hair styles, and as you know , we love all those topics, and it's a great opportunity while we are in London.
Thank you for your time.
We're looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I had always wanted to travel abroad and experience other people's lives and cultures, so I decided to go to Paris as soon as I finished university.
I arrived in Paris on New Year's Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a small amount of money.
But in spite of all of these disadvantages , I was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it.
So suddenly, a week later I found myself a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke French at that time.
It took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
I am writing on behalf of the students in your English class.
Firstly, we are pleased and would like to thank you for your arranging to take us to London for 3 days.
Unfortunately, some students have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to the show.
This show will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March between 10.00 - 19.00, includes the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
It is a great opportunity to visit it because it is held only twice a year and entrance is free for students.
Furthermore, most of us are designers so this might help to update our knowledge as well.
Therefore, I would like to suggest that on Monday 13 and Wednesday 14 of March, we still stick with your plan.
We might change the schedule on Tuesday 14 March, from visiting the Science Museum to The London fashion and Leisure Show.
I would appreciate it if the matter could be settled easily and look forward to hearing from you soon.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I remember when I was in secondary school.
At that time, my friends and I were so daring and full of energy.
One day before an exam, we were so excited and frightened because we weren't ready for the exam.
We knew that our teacher kept the exam papers in her desk.
One of my friends came up with the idea that we had to steal them.
The question was who would be the person to perform this action so we tossed a coin, and the result was me.
I was so scared and frightened because if I was caught I would be punished.
However, I had to do it otherwise my friends would call me a chicken and they dared me to do it.
So, that afternoon at lunchtime, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quietly and calmly.
Finally, I was successful in doing that.
I took it to copy and returned it without anyone seeing me.
That was the most scary and daring thing that I did in my childhood.
I can't imagine what would have happened if I had been caught.
I'm writing to you to thank you for the programme you have organised.
All the students are very pleased and we are looking forward to going to London.
We know we are going for only three days, but we'll have enough time to see one of the biggest cities in the world.
London is the place to be because there is always something happening.
We are all very happy with your programme, we especially like the idea of going sightseeing by ourselves and visiting the National Art Gallery.
All the students would be very grateful .
I think for all of us home is something which is very important.
Home sweet home.
We call home the place where we live or the country where we come from.
Anyway home is always the place to go because it is ours, we feel safe and comfortable there.
Home sweet home.
After hard work, we want to go home to have our corner where we are able to rest and relax.
We live in a very busy world! Working long hours, doing plenty of activities, going out, going on holidays.
We don't even spend time with our families.
Probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there.
We really appreciate your organising a very nice programme, which has been organised by you this time.
In particular the River trip to Greenwich makes us very excited and we are really looking to forward to this.
By the way, on the 14th of March the LONDON Fashion Show and Leisure show will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall.
We are very interested in this.
We have a great opportunity to learn about the latest fashions free because we are students.
Therefore if you could change the programme on 14th, we would be very happy.
Could you consider this for us? We're looking forward to your reply.
As a developing modern society, .
Architecture .
In the future we can expect to have a new material and it will make our life more comfortable and convenient.
In Japan, crime among minors is increasing.
It is said that one of the reasons is that a small separate room makes children unsociable and depressed.
Therefore Japanese architects consider and try not to create dark separate rooms.
Also , our home of the future will be more convenient.
On the other hand the inside of the house will be very simple.
Although the height might still be the same, because human height won't change so much, unless 10000 years have passed.
A few days ago, we saw an advertisement about "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which seems to be very interesting.
Therefore, after having talked about it, we all concluded that we would be pleased to go there.
Let me explain to you what it is: It is an exhibition which takes place in the "Central Exhibition Hall" on Tuesday and deals with the latest fashions, the different , make-up and so on...
What do you think about our jobs? It would be very interesting for us as fashion is of great interest for people our age.
Moreover, you wouldn't have to worry about the price as it is free for students.
If you agree, we will only have to change the programme on Tuesday afternoon: I mean that instead of shopping, we would go to this exhibition.
But I guess that neither we nor you would be against the sacrifice of a "Shopping-Afternoon" - that we can even have on Wednesday during our free time - so that we are able to enjoy the Fashion and Leisure Show...
The of Famous people's private lives has always been a hot topic...
On the one hand, those people are like us in the way that they had a childhood, they got married and had a family...
The only difference between them and us is the kind of job they are doing, which is literally a "public job".
Therefore, why do we have to talk and gossip about them?! But on the other hand, the aim of a "public job", such as politician or actor, is to be known and appreciated by the population.
And here comes the : Do we have to someone's privacy to judge his work and appreciate him? Well, some people would say yes whereas others would disagree.
I guess this is an unanswerable question...
But to solve this problem, we must think first about its origin...
"Reading the gossip": isn't it what all of us love doing?? Therefore we should try to educate ourselves so as to respect other people .
Thank you for the good programme which you have organised.
There is only one thing we don't agree with you about, it is the Tuesday 14 March.
We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to this show.
It would be very special for us because we haven't seen anything like that before.
There are four different shows.
First there is a show with the latest fashions, after they show  leisure and sportswear and then there are the make-up and the hairstyles shows.
The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because entry to the show is free for students.
You see, the programme only has to be changed on Tuesday morning.
In the afternoon we go shopping how you have organised your programme.
In our opinion it is enough to go one time to a museum and it is on Wednesday .
Now, we are in the 21st century.
Most of us live in houses or flats and it is mostly very comfortable.
But in what kind of homes will people live in the future? What will be different and what won't change? We will need our imagination to answer these questions but we will never know the right answer.
I have ideas.
In the future, maybe in 2113, there will be houses like now but with more technical things.
Life at home will be easier because a refrigerator which fills itself up or a bathroom which cleans itself.
So, people won't have to clean their houses because there will be a machine for all the work.
But I think that people will also need a bed and a table with a chair.
These things and a lot more won't change or won't be forgotten.
So, I think houses will only be more modern and more practical but not very different from our homes in the present.
We have just seen the advertisement for 'The London fashion and Leisure Show'.
The show includes the latest fashions, sportswear and make-up.
We are very keen on fashions and make-up.
Moreover, the admission fee is free for students.
It would be a great opportunity to study the latest fashion trend.
It is held at the 'Central Exhibition Hall' on 14 March., from 10 A.M.
to 7 P.M.
Therefore we could go there after the Science Museum.
If some students want to go shopping, they could go on 15 March, because we have free time on 15 March in the afternoon.
'A robot wakes me up at 7 A.M.
every morning.
I am served breakfast with fresh coffee.
Washing and cleaning have already been done by my robot maid! Everybody might dream about this kind of situation.
It may come true in the near future.
Our robot maid will do all of the housework instead of a human.
In addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the house by computer such as temperature or vacuum cleaning.
However, this robot cannot replace a mother or wife.
They can clean the house but they cannot give affection to the family.
Children need parents' love and support all the time.
To sum up, modern technology will bring lots of changes and our daily lives will be more convenient.
But these robots cannot replace a warm-hearted human.
I am writing this letter because we saw your programme for our next trip to London and we would like to suggest to you just one thing.
First of all, we would like to say thank you very much for organising our tour around London and our programme, which is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit.
Secondly, we saw last Saturday in the Oxfor News an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to know if it would be possible to include this show in our tour.
The show is going to take place in the General Exhibition Hall in London, Thursday the 14 of March, so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the Science Museum.
We think that it could be a great opportunity because in one day we can see everything concerning fashionable clothes, new make-up and hairstyles.
Furthermore it is free for students.
If you would like more information do not hesitate to contact me.
I am looking forward to your reply.
The reason for my letter is that our class would like to suggest a few changes to our programme for London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme.
First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have made organising this excellent programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement.
We think that perhaps on Tuesday March 14 we could change the time when we go to the Science Museum, and go to the Museum earlier, perhaps at half past eight in the morning, so we could go later, at ten o'clock, to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts till seven o'clock in the evening.
And we thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have anything to do on that afternoon.
Finally, we would like to ask you to think about our suggestion.
The show would be fantastic.
We would learn about the latest fashions, Leisure and sports wear, and also learn about how to .
It's a great opportunity to learn more about fashion.
Please, let us go to the show, because students are admitted free.
I think that the home of the Future would probably be better than a home is now.
In the future, our homes will incorporate the most advanced technologies.
Computers will play an important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because via the computer we will be able to buy whatever we want.
Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want on our computer.
We won't have any need to leave home, because the computer will give us everything.
Although computers will give us all the material things, they will not give us things like the feeling of being in your home, , etc.
Those things won't change in our home.
We will live in our homes with our family, who will give us love ...
that kind of thing will never change.
In conclusion, in the future home our living conditions will improve, and the computer will be very important for us, but it won't control us, because we still have the most important thing in a home .
That will be the same as now.
I wanted to thank you for allowing us to have this great opportunity to visit London.
I have read the programme and I find it very appealing, especially because of the River trip to Greenwich.
However, I have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and I was wondering if we could visit it.
The show is going to be at the Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March from 10.00 to 19.00.
the latest fashions, leisure- and sports-wear, some make-up and also different hairstyles.
The students are admitted free so we won't have to pay for the visit.
We all think this is a great opportunity to learn more about daily London life and what people like to wear.
I suggest visiting the London Fashion and Leisure Show on Tuesday morning and visiting the Science Museum on Friday afternoon.
We all hope you will consider our suggestion.
Almost everyone hates other people gossiping about their private lives.
It's a natural reaction to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping about you and .
So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or film stars, don't deserve to be followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time.
I think that the journalists' only aim is money, because they know that if they famous people's private lives they will earn lots of money selling the magazine or the newspaper.
But they don't consider the problems the rumours may cause the famous family or couple.
Sometimes the journalists' aim isn't the money: there are some journalists who may try to spoil a politician's or film star's career only because they are jealous.
In conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
I am writing to thank you for the good programme, especially for Wednesday, because the other students and I like art galleries.
But last Friday, we saw an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show".
Now, we want to know if it is possible to go to see this Show.
It is on Tuesday 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall between 10.00 and 19.00.
We think that it is a great opportunity because it is just once per year and it is free for students.
We suggest you change the programme.
We think that Monday and Wednesday are good, but we ask you to change the programme on Tuesday.
If it is possible, we want to go to the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and not go shopping.
Last July, I went to spend two weeks with my best friend in a beautiful village in the south of France, near Saint-Tropez.
We stayed at my aunt's house which was in the centre of the village.
In front of my aunt's house, there was a house with a swimming pool, garage and garden.
My aunt told me it was a famous French singer's house.
One night, I heard a strange sound.
I looked outside and saw two men go into the house in front of mine.
They went into the house through a window.
I thought it was some robbers.
I said to my friend that I wanted to go to see and he must phone the police.
I went near the house and waited to see what would happen.
After ten minutes, one man came out with a big bag and got into his car.
When the other man came out, I caught him and fought him.
The first man went away because a police car arrived.
The policeman came to take the burglar and thanked me for catching him.
I'm writing to you about our trip which you have organised.
First of all, thank you for the programme.
We saw the details and were pleased with them, especially the river trip to Greenwich and visiting the National Art Gallery.
As you know, there is some free time in your programme.
If you don't mind, we can go shopping in this free time.
This change would give us the opportunity to go to the show on Tuesday afternoon.
We hope you accept our suggestion.
It would make us so happy.
All people have some difficulties with their jobs but some have more than others.
The reason for this is that they are famous and everybody wants to know about them.
Having a private life is important for everybody.
I think people want this.
If you are a famous person, for example a singer, film star, politician or well-known footballer, you haven't got any choice.
Because people want to learn everything about you, journalists follow you all the time.
I know they are not like us.
They are famous, but I think they need to be alone sometimes.
They need to be with their family in peace.
This is important for everybody and I think this is important for them, too.
I think the media must be more understanding.
We don't have to know about their every second.
We have to remember that they need a private life like us.
We can love them without disturbing them too.
First of all, I would like to thank you for the wonderful programme you have organised for our trip to London, especially because we will have both cultural trips and entertainment, like shopping.
I can tell you that we are all looking forward to going there.
However, I have been asked by the class to propose another visit to you.
We would all like to go and see the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday 14th March, from 10.00 to 19.00, in London's Central Exhibition Hall.
This show is about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
Hoping to hear of your decision soon.
Nowadays, most people think that famous people have such a good life (with lots of money, comfortable houses etc) that they have to stop complaining about the media's treatment , because they have chosen to have this kind of life.
On the one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the public, and so on.
Moreover, especially with film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the TV or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their careers.
However, on the other hand, it must be so annoying to be followed by journalists or photographers all the time.
You can't go outside in peace, and there is always a crowd of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you.
The question you have to ask yourself is: would you like to have people around your house all the time watching you or people following you everywhere? I am sure that nobody would like this.
That is why I think that famous people deserve a private life, like everybody else, and that journalists should not follow them everywhere.
I am writing to tell you that my class is interested in going to the show which takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March.
We have seen it in an advertisement and I would like to go to the show.
I would also like to tell you that it is a very interesting event because it includes all the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear and make-up as well as hairstyles.
It is a great opportunity for us because the is fascinating and free.
I would be very grateful if you could change the programme so as to allow us to go to the show.
For example, we would be able to put off our visit to the science museums on Tuesday morning till Wednesday afternoon.
The fashion show starts at 10 o'clock and finishes at 7 o'clock.
All people have the right to have a private life without other people disturbing them and following them all the time.
Journalists follow famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take photos and get information about them.
After that the journalists sell their information to the newspapers and magazines in order to earn money.
I think that it is very dangerous because the famous people cannot have a private life and consequently they may suffer from depression and , which may lead them to suicide.
I think that the government have to protect them and their private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
I think that the government is responsible for the private life of the people.
All people have the right to live freely, without being disturbed by other people.
I am a student in the English class.
All my classmates are looking forward to going to London.
Thank you so much for organising such a great programme.
I am writing to you about changing our plan on Tuesday 14 March.
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go to the show.
The advertisement said it is taking place on Tuesday 14 March from 10am to 7pm.
Since the London Fashion and Leisure Show does not take place so often and also they will , if we attend this show, it would be a great opportunity for us.
For these reasons, we would like to suggest you go to the show instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon.
I am sure that our trip is going to be great.
 Otherwise I had to keep walking until the train started.
When I did that, I was travelling around Japan.
It was the very last day of my trip and at that time I was in Kyoto.
Although I intended to stay at a youth hostel, I could not find any place to stay, and also it was too late to buy a train ticket to go back home.
I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossom tree.
Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moonlight helped me to see things.
I was regretting having risked staying in the park alone.
Suddenly, a strong wind blew up thousands and thousands of petals.
I saw the pink snow there.
I would like first, on behalf of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London.
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it.
George was about to be lynched on account of his skin colour.
Someone had to react ...
I had to react! ...
otherwise I would have felt responsible for his death, for the rest of my life.
George was lying on the floor, surrounded by his own lake of blood.
He had just been beaten by a group of white men.
And he was too weak to resist the rats coming from everywhere and eating his face, his legs and his arms, waiting with great impatience for his death.
He had been chained and no way could he escape from his fate without some help! The place where I was hidden was overlooking the house where he was kept prisoner.
No one was guarding him.
They were all celebrating their victory with a gorgeous dinner around the fireplace.
I tiptoed as far as the house, carefully opened the door, and headed to George.
At the very moment when he saw me, his eyes began to shine and I could feel that he had recovered some hope.
I rescued him and we were about to flee, taking back our dignity and freedom, overwhelmed with joy, when we saw a white man, aiming his gun at us, and about to shoot ...
Thank you for organising the school trip to London.
I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery.
However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class.
Could I suggest that you consider changing the programme? The London Fashion and Leisure Show is going to take place on 14th March in the Central Exhibition Hall in London.
According to the advertisement I have seen, it is supposed to show the latest fashions, leisure- and sports-wear, make-up and hairstyles.
It is also free to enter for students.
It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with greater motivation.
Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping during our free time on 15th March.
First of all, they are the same as ordinary people even if they are treated as celebrities.
Therefore, they deserve to lead a normal life as we do.
Secondly, no one has the right to snoop into anyone's private life even if they are journalists.
Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of our human rights.
However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right to privacy.
To sum up, famous people are the same as we are, and we all have the right to lead a private life and no right to intrude on their privacy.
Therefore, I strongly believe that famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
We would like to thank you for organising our programme.
We really appreciate your attention.
The programme you suggest is versatile and full of interesting activities.
We are eager to attend the National Art Gallery and Science Museum.
Our students will have a great opportunity to see the latest fashions, as this unique show is held only once a year.
What's more, new hairstyles and leisure and sports wear are presented there.
And apart from that, this event is free of charge.
We would be very grateful if you could change our programme for Tuesday afternoon.
We are thinking here particularly of the fact that we can go to the show, instead of shopping.
We tend to think that famous people, such as politicians and film stars, are very happy and satisfied with their life.
But such an attitude is wrong.
It is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
The first point I would like to make is that the private life of a celebrity is open to the public.
I am thinking here particularly of the fact that every event and action is widely discussed in the mass-media.
It is common knowledge that such attention inevitably tells on relationships in the family.
Another aspect is that the children of famous people suffer a lot from this attention.
They can't communicate with ordinary children or attend ordinary schools.
And last, but not least, is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, showing their real feelings to the public.
And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character.
I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering in their lives.
I would like to sum up by saying that every person, whether famous or not, deserves to have a private life without being followed or disturbed.
First of all, I would like to say thank you to you, Mr Robertson, for planning to take us to London for three days.
Your programme looks very interesting, especially the River Trip to Greenwich, which I have always dreamt of.
However, we have seen an advertisement in an English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00.
The show will have the latest fashions from the top fashion designers in the world.
The leisure show will have leisure- and sports-wear, new make-up styles and new hairstyles for next year.
The best thing is that it is free because we are students.
We would like to ask you whether we can change some of the programme.
Our suggestion is that we can go shopping on Wednesday 15 March so on Tuesday afternoon we can go to The London Fashion and Leisure Show.
We won't miss any event that you have planned and we could also have a great opportunity to see the show.
Yours sincerely.
In my opinion, everybody wants to have a happy life in our world.
We want to do whatever we want.
Sometimes we do the right things and sometimes we do the wrong things.
We are ordinary people.
We work and go home to do activities with our family or go out together.
Politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work.
They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
However, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of the public so that people will never forget them.
On the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
The trip that you have planned for us students is a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city .
Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer the students the best way to spend their time without wasting time with silly places or events.
We'd like to thank you because this kind of event shows how dedicated you are to our school and the students that study there.
It's especially great to visit the Science Museum, because of its exhibitions.
But there's something that I'd like to ask.
The London Fashion and Leisure Show will start on Tuesday.
It's a great opportunity for us because there will be exhibitions of the latest fashions, of the new hairstyles, and of the new leisure and sports clothes and people teaching how to apply make-up.
Our suggestion is that you could change .
In this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion Show.
Thanks for your attention and we're waiting for your answer.
Famous people are special in the eyes of the rest of society.
They form opinions and invent new fashion styles.
Nowadays, the media is expanding its means of communication so they need more information.
The media is starting to encroach into the private life of these famous people.
It's important to respect other people's lives because can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life.
If the famous person doesn't mind being filmed in his personal life there's no problem.
But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that.
Everybody likes to be with their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around.
In summary, the best thing to do is try to extract from these people their best qualities and not try to find things that could irritate them like family problems or personal problems.
Respect is essential.
They deserve to have a private life like any ordinary person.
Thank you for organising the trip to London.
It is really fantastic, especially the event on 13th March, when we are having a river trip to Greenwich.
The reason that I am writing is that my class has seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It is worth visiting the exhibition and we would like to go there.
The show is on Tuesday March 14th at the Central Exhibition Hall, London, from 10.00 to 19.00.
In the hall, there are four important themes; latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles.
This is a great opportunity for the students to learn about the changes in fashion and leisure and it is free.
I was wondering if you would consider our suggestion about changing the programme.
We all agreed that the programme on Monday March 13th is wonderful.
However, we would like to change the plans on Tuesday and Wednesday in the morning.
On Tuesday morning, we will visit the London Fashion and Leisure show instead of visiting the Science Museum and we will go there the following morning.
The visit to the National Art Gallery should be cancelled because it .
That is all I would like to recommend you do.
I would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
The discussion about whether or not famous people deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time is a controversial one.
There are people from both sides of the argument who have strong feelings.
There is a reason why these people's lives should be focused on by the media.
Obviously, they have a lot of fans and their fans would like to know what happens to them.
In addition, their lives may be a good example for other people to follow.
Sometimes, a lot of people don't know what to do and they should imitate the person who they admire.
However, there are some disadvantages that we should consider.
Firstly, famous people would like to do anything they want to without being focused on by the media.
I think it would be annoying if you did something and tomorrow your behaviour would be known by the public.
Even though, famous people can be a good example, they .
A lot of people try to be like people who they admire, for example, buying the clothes that famous people wear.
The reason why they know what kind of clothes famous people wear is these people have a public life.
To prevent a lot of people from copying too much we shouldn't inform them of all aspects of the life of famous people.
I agree that famous people's lives should be private.
It is of benefit to themselves and the public.
I am writing, on behalf of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you are giving us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications to the programme.
The programme you have already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination of cultural visits and more relaxed activities.
But, on the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", which includes a range of different stands.
The only day we can attend this show is Tuesday 14th March from 10 am to 7 pm in the Central Exhibition Hall.
We are really interested in visiting this show and the main advantage is that entry is free for students.
In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly to the show after the Science Museum.
We all agree that we have enough time on Wednesday for shopping.
I hope that you will agree to this suggestion.
I am waiting for your answer.
We can consider this problem from two different points of view.
On the one hand, these people chose to become public figures.
If we don't want to be in the newspapers, we don't go into politics or the movies! But, on the other hand, everybody has the right to have a secret garden, the right to be with his/her family without being disturbed by journalists and photographers.
The case of Princess Diana showed how this problem can reach extremes.
In conclusion, I would say that both parties, famous people and journalists, have to respect some rules.
As public people, stars and politicians have to allot some time to their public but fans and press people have to respect their private life and to stay polite and respectful.
I am writing to you to thank you for your programme which the next three days in London.
In particular, sightseeing by bus in the morning and the river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon are exciting activities.
 programme for Tuesday is very interesting.
Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show, which is held once a year.
This show would give us a lot of information about current activities, fashion and what is happening here in London with, for example, the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles.
It is a great opportunity because we will be able to learn about London culture.
We can be part of this show and be up to date with style and fashion.
The admission is free for students.
The show starts at 10.00 and finishes at 19.00 so we can change our afternoon programme to allow us to go to the show at the Central Exhibition Hall instead.
If you agree, after the Science Museum, we can have lunch at a restaurant near the museum, then we can go directly from the restaurant to the Central Exhibition Hall.
We will be on time for the second show at 13.30 P.M and we can enjoy the show until 19.00 P.M.
I am looking forward to hearing your opinion about my suggestion.
"Home" has so much meaning for people.
It doesn't matter who they are, where they come from, what colour skin they have.
Home is an institution that creates humans and makes them  people and good members of their communities.
When I think of "the Home of the Future", I want to have a home which is built with a new material.
If we had a home made out of plastic and also windows made out of plastic we could have our home for a long time.
If the door is broken, we can replace it quickly and it is not expensive when it is plastic.
We have more time to stay together at home, watching TV, playing games, etc....
because we can access the Internet at home.
We can have all the information from the Internet.
I think it is the best means of education and working when we can stay and learn or work from home.
We have more time for the family, who mostly need care and love.
There will be a number of Developments in Technology in the future, which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love.
These 2 feelings cannot be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home in the future.
First of all I would like to thank you for organizing this trip to London, and for taking care of the programme.
It is a very good schedule, especially because you have considered different activities for us.
Personally, I think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attend , and we are all interested in the latest fashion.
We noticed that it is free for students, so the price of the trip will not rise.
We discussed the programme, and because the show will take the whole day, we would not mind going to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having free time all afternoon.
I wasn't sure of what to do, and the pressure of everyone watching me was driving me mad.
Finally, I managed to move my right foot closer to the edge.
I could hear the crowd shouting 'Go, go'.
That was my only chance.
Only a few more seconds, otherwise my turn would be over.
I didn't even think of looking down.
I was already paralysed, and that wouldn't help me at all.
Then, by some 'strange power', my left foot was moving and I wanted to stop it, but it was too difficult.
Those minutes up in the air, feeling the wind in my face, were fantastic....And then I was terrified when I couldn't open the parachute! Fortunately, I wasn't alone.
First of all I would like to thank you for the good programme you have organised for our trip to London.
The sightseeing by bus, in particular, seems to be very interesting.
But we would like to suggest something to you: there is a trendy event about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles, on the 14th of March.
It is called "The London Fashion and Leisure Show." This would be a great opportunity for us because we are all interested in clothes, sports and fashion.
I almost forgot to mention that it is free for students! Unfortunately we have noticed that on the 14th we are already visiting the Science Museum.
The show lasts nine hours, from 10.00-19.00, the whole day! Our question now is: could we go to this show? We could maybe change Tuesday's programme to Wednesday.
We would all prefer to go to the show; free time is not so important for us.
Thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-day programme in London and I am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the National Art Gallery.
We are concerned that this is a great and the unique opportunity for us to see this show, as it takes place only once a year and only in London.
Certainly, we do not refuse to take part in other activities in London.
Probably, you will agree to the London Fashion and Leisure Show instead of the Science Museum and shopping on Tuesday.
Thank you for your attention and understanding.
Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will respond to what people say.
Perhaps, there will be personal computers which will control everything, every item of furniture, light, temperature.
Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room.
But, on the other hand, people will still have to programme them, as they have to do nowadays.
Maybe children will not have to go to school, they will just stay in their rooms and study on a computer, gaining some kind of on-line education.
All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, cups will be washed automatically.
It is possible that only one computer will do all this and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight..
This will be your home, another member of your family and your house or flat as well.
This is my vision of the Home of the Future and I wish I could live in it.
First of all I would like to thank you for the chance to make such a gorgeous trip.
We are really looking forward to visiting the city and going to the museum and the gallery.
However, there is one point that we would like to change in the programme.
We are interested in visiting "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" during our trip.
The show is very interesting because we could see the latest fashion, hairstyles and make-up, and also the leisure and sports wear.
Furthermore it is totally free for students.
All these exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.
We think that we could go there on the 14th of March, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
This one could be moved to the 15th in the evening.
It is also possible to go to the show in the morning but we totally agree that we don't want to lose our visit to the Science Museum.
We truly hope you will consider our change.
Please contact us if you have any question.
Nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance ...
but not everyone does the same thing.
On the one hand you find the ones that are well known and never talk about their private life.
They use the publicity exclusively for their work.
On the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
I mean, they enjoy being the focus or the centre of attention for everyone, even though it means their lives.
The media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
Nevertheless, sometimes the media disturbs their lives in a wrong way.
First, thank you for your programme.
It is very varied and interesting.
We all like it.
But last week we saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
This presentation will show the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear.
We would be very interested in seeing English fashion.
At this show we could see different new make-up and hairstyles.
The event is a great opportunity because it is on the 14th of March and it is free for students.
For practical information, this show starts at 10.00 and closes at 19.00.
It will be in the Central Exhibition Hall in London.
It is not too far and the opening hours suit us.
About the programme, we suggest seeing the show on the Tuesday morning and afterwards going shopping.
As far as we are concerned, we prefer to see the Science Museum rather than the National Art Gallery.
We also suggest visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon, if some of us are interested, we could see the National Art Gallery.
I hope you won't be too angry about this change but we would all like to go to the show.
Generally speaking, homes will change considerably.
They will become less dark and more comfortable than today.
People's homes will be built more economically by using natural energy like solar or wind energy.
These improvements will be by the lack of petrol and non-renewable energy.
About the size of houses, I think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
We will also see very tall buildings which contain a lot of narrow flats.
In contrast, in the suburbs or in the countryside, more and more rich people will build big houses.
Homes like this will be built with the latest technologies and will be very luxurious.
But about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor, they will be the same in the future.
New technologies and facilities won't improve the relationship between people.
I think that people will be as alone and jealous as today.
First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks for the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon.
After reading the whole programme, we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London, which will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago.
.
Make-up .
Hairstyles.
After discussing this, we want to suggest how we think the programme should be re-arranged.
Instead of going to the science museum, we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is open on Tuesday, March 14, from 10 am to 7 pm.
After that we could continue our trip as it has been arranged already.
The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie - Agatha Christie.
Agatha Christie has always been my favourite writer.
Not only because she's famous and wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce characters and how to tell a good story the readers.
One of her most interesting and famous works is a novel called "The Orient Express".
It's a detective story, like all the stories written by her.
In other words the story is set on a train which the orient.
On the train, all the passengers seem to be involved in a crime.
This is such a fascinating story and it's the way Agatha Christie tells it.
The mystery is drawn out until the last page of the book.
I read it and I have really enjoyed it.
It has been a fabulous experience so if anybody would like to read a good detective story, try reading Agatha Christie's detective story and you won't regret it at all.
I'm writing to you to complain about the three-day programme.
Thank you very much for your excellent programme, and especially for the visit to The National Art Gallery.
All our class like to see the beautiful pictures which were drawn by brilliant artists and painters.
We saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and our class would like to go to the show.
It starts on Tuesday March 14 and we can go there instead of visiting the Science Museum or going shopping.
Anyway we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon because we have some free time.
 at this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and even hairstyles.
All our class and I would like to see this show.
You know what else? We don't need to pay.
It's free because we are students.
It's a great opportunity because in our fast-developing world we have to look fashionable and this kind of show happens quite rarely.
I think you'll .
As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having some free time.
I'm looking forward to receiving a letter from you.
Thank you very much.
We can't say for certain how people's homes will be different in the future but we can always imagine and  incredible things about life in the future.
Of course there will be differences between today's homes and future ones.
I think houses will grow from twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy them.
I think more and more people will have at least one flat; it won't matter if you are rich or not.
The rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion, where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact.
Even TV-sets will be on the ceiling.
The rooms will be much bigger and wider than now, and you will have up to twenty rooms in your own flat, and even be able to switch on the light by saying simply: "Light".
If course if you have enough money in such an apartment, then you can afford it.
Now what's going to be the same? Well as I said, if you're poor, the government will still give you a flat but a very ugly one, probably with rats in it.
.
They will have to stay on the streets as the streets are their home.
I hope and I that the future will bring us good moments in life where everybody will have a home and warm, friendly family relationships.
Thank you for organising the programme for the trip to London.
There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and they are especially looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting the National Art Gallery.
However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London.
The students in my class have just seen the advertisement for a show in today's edition of The Times.
There will be The London Fashion and Leisure Show in Central Exhibition Hall on the 14th of March.
It starts at 10:00 am and finishes at 9:00 p.m.
All of my classmates would like to go there because it is a great chance to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
Besides, students don't have to pay an entrance fee because it is free for students.
The fashion show is only on the 14th of March, so I would be grateful if you could allow all of my classmates to go there after visiting the Science Museum instead of going shopping.
First of all, everybody has rights to keep their own life private, especially when they are in serious situations such as divorce or a family member's or closest friend's death.
It is too cruel for them to have their feeling monitored at that time.
Another reason that I agree that famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time, it would result in their death.
For example, if Diana, who was the ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating a man, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.
To sum up, nobody wants their private life to be revealed in public.
Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.
I was asked by my class to write to you.
First of all, we want to thank you for having organised a very good programme for the three-day trip to London.
Indeed, we are especially interested in the sightseeing tour by bus.
The river trip to Greenwich is also a marvellous idea! Moreover, we couldn't go there without visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery.
On the one hand, I think that some famous people are looking for media attention.
Indeed, it can be useful for their career.
The more they are in the media, the more famous they will be.
In my opinion, some of them need to be appreciated by fans, they need to be loved and see themselves on television.
However, some others only use the media to come back, because they cannot find a job anymore.
They need to be famous again.
Besides, I think that some stars sometimes call journalists to tell them where they will be, in order to have free publicity.
Moreover, in my opinion, it is also a good way for them to earn money.
Famous people are so often asked to give interviews, either in the newspapers or on television, that the outcome is that they want to be paid for it.
I would like to congratulate you on the excellent programme that you have prepared.
I think that it is such a good programme, especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting.
However, the rest of the students and I have heard about the London Fashion and Leisure show that will be celebrated at the Central Exhibition Hall in London and where the latest fashions will be shown.
There we will have the chance to be made up or to try new hairstyles, too.
And it has free entrance for students.
We think it will be a great opportunity because it will take place during our visit to London, on the 14th of March.
We think that, if you don't have any problem, we could visit the Science Museum on Wednesday after visiting the National Art Gallery so that we could go to the London Fashion and Leisure show.
We are waiting for your decision and we will accept it whatever it may be.
In my opinion, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today.
I think that it will have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa.
Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like a UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very great, they will probably consist of making the housework easier.
The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginning of the 20th century with our houses.
Both are very similar but now we have new technologies.
On balance then, I think that the houses that we see in films won't really exist.
I am writing to you in connection with your programme for spending three days in London.
I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March between 10.00 - 19.00.
I would be grateful if you could include this show in your programme.
It is very thoughtful of you to take all of us to London.
This is a great opportunity for me to explore and experience London myself, especially The London fashion and leisure shows.
Most of the shows are about fashionable things for students my age.
I think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to  hairstyles.
In my opinion, I think you should have this event in the afternoon instead of going shopping and move the shopping slot to the afternoon on Wednesday.
I hope this information will help and include it in your programme.
I trust you to pay immediate attention to my suggestions.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and jumped out of the tower.
There were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test.
I was very afraid of the height and was very nervous.
I was given the list of activities while I was taking part in the adventure school schemes at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand.
There were many tasks that I had to complete; for instance, climb the mountain, learn how to use various kinds of gun, and how to survive if I got lost in a forest.
The last task I had to do was jump out of the high tower.
The assistants were the real soldiers and they were very kind and helpful, even though they looked very strict and unkind.
It was the hardest time for me because I lived in the city most of my life and I had never known how to survive in a forest and how difficult .
I eventually managed to complete all the tasks that I had been given and I was very proud of this.
I, as a head member of the students who participate in this year's trip to London, would like to thank you for the excellence of the programme you have planned for us.
In particular, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries in the world.
London being one of the most multicultural, multiracial cities, we cannot avoid the fact that in these days The London Fashion And Leisure Show takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall (Tuesday March 14th) 10:00-19:00.).
Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes to the fabulous Programme you have offered.
These changes will not affect the contents of the programme itself.
I also would like to remark that this change does not increase the cost of the trip, because the London Fashion And Leisure Show is free for students.
I want to thank you, Sir, for your time.
"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it." Nowadays I remember those exciting days in which danger was knocking at your door every day.
It was 20 years ago and we had been friends since we were 10.
In those days we decided to be friends forever and work for NASA.
I remember it as if it were yesterday.
We were both 18, and we had the university access test already done.
The problem was that both of us wanted to go to the same university, the NASA university in Houston (Texas).
Of course we hadn't got enough points in the test to do it .
So, we decide to access our school's Main database and change our test results.
This way we could obtain rare places at NASA university.
The task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it.
There was nothing to lose.
It took us two weeks to modify the results in a very complex operation in which we should take care of hiding all our fingerprints.
The operation was successful.
Both of us went to the NASA university and nowadays we work for the CIA developing secure systems and new encryption algorithms.
I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days of our stay in London and would like to thank you.
Firstly, the whole class is very pleased with the programme, especially with the visit to the National Art Gallery.
We have been told there are a lot of interesting paintings and ancient sculptures there, which we are all keen to see .
A couple of days ago, my classmates made the suggestion that they would also like to see the London Fashion And Leisure Show in London, at the Central Exhibition Hall, which was advertised in a school magazine, and there is free entry for students.
The show includes the latest fashions, sportswear , make-up and hairstyles.
At the same time it would be a great opportunity for most of us because we are going to study "Art and Design" next year.
We would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and hope to hear from you soon.
Well, first of all, I think it's quite difficult to be a musician, film star or a politician without being followed by journalists all the time.
In my opinion, most of these people are aware of the consequences of fame, like not having a "private life" anymore.
As soon as they are famous, they are surrounded by their fans and reporters .
I can imagine how annoying it can be sometimes.
Just imagine that you'd like to go shopping, clubbing or to a restaurant with friends.
There's really no way to be together simply with your friends or relatives without being disturbed by the paparazzi.
On the one hand I can understand how important it is for the journalists to take pictures for the newspaper or magazines they work for.
It is the way they earn money, of course.
But on the other hand I have to mention that they go too far sometimes to get a picture.
For example, Lady Diana.
Do you think she would still be alive if she and her boyfriend hadn't been followed by those nosy paparazzi? Well, this is an open question to anyone.
I would like to say "thank you" for this plan for a trip to London.
We are really excited about it, especially the boat trip on the river.
This is a good idea because we all want to see Greenwich.
We also like the idea of going to the National Art Gallery and sightseeing by bus.
It seems it's going to be great fun.
I do not know if it is possible to make any changes to this plan but we saw an ad in "Time Out" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see.
The show's date is very convenient - March 14 -, and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there.
As you know, we all come from different countries and we are keen to learn some other things about English culture besides the language itself.
Attending this fashion and leisure show, we will get the chance to see a lot of enjoyable and different things, such as new hair styles and make-up , or what what the fashions in London are at the moment.
Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum.
We can find another time to go to the Science Museum on any other day, but this show is just on this Tuesday.
Also, it's free for students.
I hope it won't cause a problem to change the programme.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Although humans are social creatures, all people need an area in which they can be apart from other people.
This is essential to renew the energy which is necessary for daily life.
Also we all like to have some special things and people in our lives to help us to feel different from others.
It can be a lover, a hobby or a habit.
Thinking about famous people, we generally tend to ignore this need.
I believe this feeling ; when somebody gets famous, whatever the job is they do, we think we have some kind of right over them.
Consequently we demand to know every single detail about them and their lives.
The press takes this demand as an order, and "but the public wants to know" becomes a nightmare for famous people.
In fact, what is a need for ordinary people is a more important need for famous people.
Because they have to spend so much time in front of other people, they are even more sensitive about their privacy.
I am quite sure that even the ones who have chosen their occupations just to be famous, don't like to be photographed when they believe they are alone.
The situation must be much worse for the ones who have become famous without desiring it.
Obviously, there is no point in saying "famous people have a right to their own lives." Although this statement is absolutely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will have to keep living with journalists.
With reference to our trip to London, on behalf of all of us, the English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special attention in organising a good programme to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London.
We have been very excited about this and coincidentally we have found another option to add to our programme, certainly if you agree with it.
We thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformations nowadays in England concerning fashion, leisure, sports and lifestyle.
However, it is your decision to change our programme a little bit.
We would suggest just not going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, and everything else could stay the same.
We are really satisfied with the sightseeing by bus, and with going to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion Show and it will be free.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
This sad and unlucky day was on Friday 1998, but it wasn't 13th even it look like it, but it was my 25th birthday.
Everything was going so badly and I knew, I could die.
Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in a dangerous and way and I don't know how, but he was able to persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, on my 25th birthday.
I was at home putting my makeup on before going to a restaurant with my friends and, suddenly, he rang the bell.
He was so tense with a gun in his hands and I could no longer speak.
He took me out with him.
I had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocaine using my cheques.
I didn't want to, because I've never approved of his drug dealing, but I couldn't do it differently.
The dangerous man who we'd gone to buy drugs off was upset with my brother and had decided to kill him, but I had killed him first.
If I didn't do it, I knew I would die.
My option was my life, but now I haven't a chance to live because I'm in prison.
First of all, I am writing to thank you for organising the school's trip to London.
The programme seems to be really interesting, especially visiting the Science Museum.
However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is going to take place on the 14th of March at the Central Exhibition Hall.
Visitors will be able to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear and also get some help with make-up or hairstyles.
It would be a great opportunity to see this show, because we are all very interested in the subject of fashion.
What is more, admission for students is free.
In our opinion we could attend the show on Tuesday, after visiting the Science Museum.
It would not be a problem to go shopping on Wednesday in our free time.
 days, when we can see a picture of a famous person on the front page of almost every newspaper, it's quite a common topic .
First of all, I think that famous people deserve to have a private life.
Journalists should not follow them all the time, trying to get an interview or take an 'interesting' picture.
Secondly, I can really understand how annoying or depressing it can be.
I think that deep inside famous people are just ordinary people and like all of us, having a private life is important for their psychological .
In conclusion, I think that it is very hard to find an answer to this question.
However, everyone needs to keep some part of his life  secret.
I am writing to you about the trip to London.
Thanks for your programme, we are all especially looking forward to Monday 13 March because we will see all the monuments in London.
However, we have got a suggestion: we saw an advertisement for "the London Fashion and Leisure Show" which is going to be on Tuesday March 14 from 10:00 to 19:00.
For all of us, it sounds like a great opportunity because we thought that this event would teach us about the way of life in London and English style....
Our request is to change the programme, either you can cancel and we can enjoy all the exhibition or if you cannot cancel the Museum, we can go there right after because we will have plenty of time to go shopping during our free time on Wednesday.
 Hoping that you will think about it carefully because we are all very excited.
In my opinion, you don't deserve to have a private life when you're famous because when you start your career you know that the media will be hunting you everywhere and the more famous you get the worse it is going to be because that is the lifestyle people want to know everything about, for instance, about their favourite actor or about their president.
They saw them many times on T.V.
or in the cinema.
So people wonder about them.
And famous people like it because if you're a star or whatever, it's because you like to show yourself.
Therefore, even if I agree sometimes the media go too far and write really bad things, if you're famous you cannot have a private life because all of this is a part of your job.
And if the media are too awful they have got the law to protect themselves.
You may be surprised to receive a letter from us.
All the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for three days.
This trip would give us the chance to see London and to improve our English .
We all like the daily programme for the three days.
In the morning, we will have the chance to see some of the sights of London by bus, for example, the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery.
In the afternoon, the river trip to Greenwich will also be a fantastic experience for us.
The reason I write to you is that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, .
It would be exciting if we had the opportunity to go to the show.
The show includes the latest fashions in sports clothing and the most fashionable make-up and hairstyles.
We all think that the London Fashion and Leisure Show will be a great opportunity for us.
The show is free for students and we can see the show instead of having free time on Wednesday in the afternoon.
Nowadays, with the help of the media, famous people, like politicians or filmstars, play an important role in our community.
It is also normally true that the journalists are after them.
They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially regarding their private life.
Who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, these are questions that most journalists are interested in.
I'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in London.
I see that you have already organised the programme.
However, the students in my class have seen an advertisement for "the London Fashion and Leisure Show" and they would all like to go to the show.
So I'm writing this letter, asking if you can change the programme.
The London Fashion and Leisure show is a special event that is organized once a year.
There are the latest Fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles - all things that young people want to see.
There is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything.
That was my situation at the time.
The story had begun two days before...
"The Honorable men's group" - Dick, Nick and I have formed this group.
Our mission was to steal women's panties.
I think that it was very stupid, but it is the most difficult thing that man can do.
It proves our to be a man.
Our first challenge was stealing Dick's girlfriend's panties, but we failed.
And she broke up the relationship with Dick and we came to the conclusion that stealing panties from young girls was very difficult.
So we tried to steal adults' panties.
Nick and Dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother's panties.
I was the only one that couldn't steal any panties.
So I decided to go to my grandmother's house and try to steal some panties.
But she was a very angry woman.
"It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it", to prove my bravery to everyone.
I had quickly entered my grandmother's room and started to get some panties.
I was very nervous and I forgot my shoes.
Next day my grandmother came and she gave my shoes to my mother.
I am a student in the FCE class and I am writing to you on behalf of my class to thank you for the programme for the three-day trip to London that you have prepared for us.
We have discussed the programme in our class and the students are very happy about that, especially because we will have the opportunity to visit the Science Museum and the National Gallery.
Last week some students in our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March.
There will be the latest fashions and leisure and sports wear on show.
In addition we will have the opportunity to see the newest make-up and hairstyles.
For these reasons, I am asking you if we can go there on Tuesday afternoon.
You can give the opportunity to the students to choose between going shopping or going to the show.
The show will be at the Central Exhibition Hall and it will be open until 7.
pm.
I hope that this change will not cause you too many problems.
In my opinion the journalists should have more respect for the private lives of famous people.
They should understand when it is too much, when they are going too far.
For instance, the tragic death of Princess Diana is an example of what a journalist must not do.
In this instance we can say that the journalists have, of course indirectly, caused her death.
On the other hand, famous people have to understand that people are interested in their lives.
If one is famous, one has to accept also the disadvantages of being famous.
Famous people must understand that the journalists are doing their job.
In my view Prince Charles is a good example of how famous people have to deal with the media.
When he goes skiing in Switzerland he always stops for a while to talk with the journalists and to give the photographers the chance to take pictures.
After this break he continues to ski without being annoyed for the rest of the holiday.
In conclusion I think that there must be more understanding and respect between famous people and the media.
I am writing to thank you for the well-organised programme you have organised.
It will be a good opportunity to visit London and interesting places like the Science Museum.
In addition it is to mention that all the students in my class are interested in going to The London Fashion and Leisure Show, which is taking place on Tuesday 14th in the Central Exhibition Hall.
The London Fashion and Leisure Show is an amazing show because there are with the latest fashions.
We could see some famous top models.
Also there will be a variety of clothes .
Also we could see the latest trend in make-up and .
With your agreement we could change the programme.
Maybe we could go shopping on Wednesday afternoon and on Tuesday we could go to the show.
We would like to have a reply so we are able to begin making the arrangements.
Many thanks again.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I never imagined I would have to face this situation.
I joined an expedition in order to explore the Rocky Mountains.
We planned a route.
We arrived at the in the morning and started to walk.
Everything was marvellous.
I got on well with all the .
The landscape was the most beautiful that I had ever seen .
The weather was delightful, except for this afternoon when it started to rain and we decided to stay the night inside a hole in the face of the mountain.
I realised that my bag was outside and I went out to look for it, when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the hole.
I was terrified, I knew that the only solution was to ask for help.
I walked alone a long distance until I found a telephone.
I called the police and .
Thank God, everything finished in a good way.
And my companions were successfully rescued.
I am writing to express my pleasure about the programme that you have prepared for our school, especially the excellent idea to visit the National Art Gallery.
In addition, I would like to inform you about an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which my classmates and I have seen.
We are really interested in the latest fashions and new hairstyles, and also we are keen on knowing about leisure and sports clothes and the girls especially enjoy seeing the different kinds of make-up.
Furthermore, we have been informed that students are allowed to visit this exhibition free.
This event takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th of March.
I would be grateful if you would consider my suggestion.
If you agree to a visit to this exhibition, we will spend the day there, thus we should cancel the shopping, but we will be able to purchase some presents the next day, as you have not organised a specific plan.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I had to hit a human being and unfortunately, although I respect every form of life, humans, animals and plants, I managed to hit a burglar.
Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt in hospital as she was ill.
On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours.
I decided to stay at home and listen to music.
I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed.
Without any warning, he pushed my arms.
I shouted as it hurt.
I realised that he was very strong.
But I was faster and more intelligent than him.
I ran quickly and I managed to escape from him, I found a hidden wooden spoon and while he was passing in front of me I hit him.
We would like to thank you for this London trip and your programme for it.
It is a really good programme, and in particular visiting the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery would be a great opportunity to learn about art and the the latest advances in science.
However, my classmates and I saw the advertisement regarding the London fashion and leisure show, which is enclosed, and want to take this opportunity to visit it, if you allow us.
It takes place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14 March.
It will be a great opportunity because it is free for students and we will be able to see the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, new hairstyles and make-up .
Although according to your programme, we will be visiting the Science Museum in the morning and shopping in the afternoon, we would like to make a suggestion which can allow us to do both.
Would it be possible to visit the Science Museum and go shopping in our free time on Wednesday in the afternoon, and instead of that to go to the London fashion and leisure show, because it is between 10.00 and 19.00 hours.
Thanking you in advance, we very much hope that you will give your attention to our request.
We look forward to hearing from you regarding this matter.
One of the most important aims of the media is to inform people about famous people such as politicians, films stars or successful musicians.
In order to fulfil their readers' requirements they constantly follow them.
This kind of people are known as paparazzi.
However, if they asked, obviously they could not take the kind of pictures which show them naked or when they are having a shower.
Maybe they would have to pay for these kinds of pictures.
On the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although they are famous they also have their private life.
Unless they do not want to share it, we must accept this.
I think the best example would be Lady Diana.
It was said that they had that accident while they were trying to escape from the paparazzi, which ended their lives.
This should not be the way .
Thank you very much for your programme, but we have another plan - to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which unfortunately is on the same day as the day we would visit the Science Museum.
So we would like you to change the plan a little.
Your programme is very good, especially as we can go to visit the Science Museum, which I heard is very good, but a visit to the London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles and it is free for students too.
So we think we should change your programme by going to the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon and doing the shopping after the show.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I climbed up the tree.
My friend was looking at me from below.
I went on climbing until I saw my friend's model aeroplane.
If I hadn't borrowed it from him, I wouldn't have been there.
No, it wasn't the time to regret it, just get it and it would be all over.
I stretched my arm, the branch I was standing on broke and I fell down on my leg.
It was badly hurt.
My friend rushed to me, then ran back to my house and called Mum.
I can't remember anything else until I woke up at a hospital, lying on a bed with my leg in plaster.
The nurse sitting beside me said to me, 'Your mother would like to have a word with you,' then she went out.
Mum came in, looking very angry.
I prayed for a short conversation.
First of all, I would like to say thank you for this good programme, especially for the decision  to visit London.
All of us appreciate this opportunity, because most students have never been to London before.
Also we can visit some famous places which we want to go to.
However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show as well.
This show takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00.
At this show, not only can we see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles, but we can also enter for free.
Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future.
If you accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday.
Nowadays, quite a few famous people suffer in their private life from disturbers such as journalists or reporters.
I would like to discuss how the media affect famous people.
A few years ago, we had the terrible news of the death of Lady Diana.
She was always being pursued by the media.
She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone.
Finally, after being chased for a long time, she was killed in a car accident.
It must be a good example of a media disaster.
I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it.
However, she definitely deserved to have a private life as a citizen.
Human rights must exist for all people.
On the other hand, there are a few famous people who desire to be watched by the media.
If the media stopped focusing on these people, they would think that they have been put in a bin like rubbish.
Moreover, many people love to watch a gossip programme on TV or in a magazine.
It is one of fun in our life.
Thank you very much for us to London.
However, a few of us would like to the "London fashion and leisure show".
This is going to take place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00.
Could you, if we may ask, reorganise our visit to the museum and also to the shopping centre.
However, none of us wishes to miss all the attractions planned in the schedule.
Perhaps we could spend our free time at the museum before going to the shopping centre.
This is a very important stay over three days.
Every one hopes to enjoy himself and come back with a lot of knowledge.
You are rich and loved.
Perhaps we could call it the "".
However, to have your photo taken and shown on television and in the newspapers increases your popularity.
.
I might also be missing the point.
You might be a princess, a politician or a footballer but are not doing it for any fame.
You were born with the talent or with the title.
You never wished to be so famous.
Whatever you do, journalists should not follow you every second.
Everyone deserves to be given the right to a private life.
First of all, we would like to thank you very much for organising such a wonderful trip with an interesting programme.
We are all extremely excited, especially because of the trip to Greenwich, the town we have always been interested in.
However, there are many other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London.
For example, at the time of our visit there is going to be "The London Fashion and Leisure Show".
It is a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of.
This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographs from.
We hope changing the excursion programme a little will not cause any problems.
Our suggestion is to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday because the fashion show lasts a whole day .
We are ready to give up our shopping and free time.
The show starts on 14th March at 10.00 and ends at 19.00 the same day.
We are sorry for any inconvenience caused by our request.
Famous people are living creatures.
They breathe, eat, feel and aside from the fact that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else.
Nobody likes to be observed constantly or touched by strangers and pointed out in the streets with no right even to just a little privacy.
I personally think the best would be to put the celebrities in cages and let people touch them, point and ask for autographs, like in the zoo.
The biggest commercial in history, I believe, but celebrities are not animals although they may be sometimes treated the same way.
On the other hand, they must have done something to become famous.
It may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know .
To sum up, I believe that everyone has the right to the privacy of their own homes and even someone extremely famous deserves to have a private life.
Unfortunately as long as their private life is interesting for ordinary people and it brings commercial gain to publishers, journalists and photographers, famous people will just have to get used to this living "under a microscope".
I come from a very strict family.
You never made a decision on your own, you always had to ask your family's opinion.
I took an exam for people who want to be theatre actors without telling my family.
Otherwise my father would have killed me and not let me go to school.
I would never ever go to school again.
Despite preparing for the exams, I continued to go to my school regularly.
I'm writing to you because I have been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme you have organised for our English class trip.
First of all, thank you for the programme, we think it is very good, especially the river trip to Greenwich, we believe we will enjoy it a lot going to Greenwich.
Moreover, in our opinion, this trip is going to be very interesting for us.
On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go the show.
We think it is a good opportunity because London fashion is the most important in the world, and we all will learn a lot about London style going to this show.
We think we could the shopping  to go to the show.
The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March.
It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there in the afternoon.
 Thinking about the media's treatment of famous people, I've realised some things.
In my view the media's treatment of famous people is very bad.
The media are looking forward to creating great expectations about famous people.
They are not trying to give information, they are only looking to get money, and to entertain the public.
On the other hand, if the media are acting in that way it is because of society.
It is society that increases the audience of the media, if nobody paid attention to the famous people's private lives, this treatment would finish.
But in my opinion, before you get famous you know what are the consequences.
As in another you may know what could happen.
To sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
I am writing you this letter to about what you have organized for us for our trip to London.
First of all, I would like to thank you for your activity programme.
I find it really good, especially because of the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery.
But I would like you to know that on Tuesday March 14th in London, there is a show, which is free for students, about the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, make-up and hairstyles called The London Fashion and Leisure Show.
All the group would enjoy going to the show, because it is a great opportunity to see an exhibition of the latest fashions.
We know that you have planned a very complete programme but we would like to suggest you move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon so that we can go to the show, which lasts from 10am to 7pm, on Tuesday.
Thank you very much for considering our request.
Politicians, musicians or film stars are watched all the time, from when they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do.
It is certain that these people have fame, fortune and success, and that many of them are rich, very rich.
They usually appear on TV, and go to shows and sports competitions...
But I'm sure that all these things cannot give them back one of the most needed things: a private life.
And believe me, there is no money in the world that will buy that.
But obviously, if these people are all the time in the newspaper, on TV and so on, it is because, although we don't want to accept it, we love following their lives.
So now, all we should have to ask ourselves is if their lifestyle is in part our fault.
Firstly, I would like to thank you for the programme that you have provided.
It is a very good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which I am sure the whole class will enjoy.
However, our class has spotted an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and all wish to attend.
It will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on the 14th March.
It will be from 10.00 till 7.00pm.
The show will be about all the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
We would also not have to worry financially as it is free for students.
This will be a great opportunity for us because we will be able to find out more about the people of London and their fashions and style.
We might also get a chance to meet new people and interact with them.
The whole class is also very excited about this fashion show and would really appreciate your giving them a chance to go.
I have a few suggestions on how the programme could be changed to fit the London Fashion and Leisure Show in .
We could do as planned for Monday and move going to the Science Museum from Tuesday to Wednesday afternoon.
We would have to forgo the shopping as we might not have enough time and the exchange rate might be too high for us to do much shopping.
We can, however, go and look around the shopping mall if we have time after the show.
Lastly, I would be very grateful if you could give us your permission to go to the show.
I hope you will consider this matter.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Every day, something changes and we become more modern.
Companies use computers instead of books, dentists use modernized electric tools instead of just a pair of pliers.
Even homes are affected.
From letters to emails, from gas stoves to electric stoves and microwaves.
But we aren't just going to stop here are we? No, in the future, the present will be the past and those things now new to us will be old, outdated and changed.
I see a very different home for us in the future.
Most things will be computerised.
We might even be using voice identification and fingerprints instead of keys.
We can turn on and off lights with touch pads and remote controls.
We might even be able to open the door without leaving the living room.
Cameras will be something usual in every house instead of that little peephole in your door.
Although all that may happen our houses may be still the same.
The rooms and sizes should remain as they were and the living rooms and everything may still be decorated in the same style.
We might still like that old carpet and couch.
The furniture should not change that much on the outside and the number of rooms should not change either.
In the future, every child might have a laptop.
And instead of going to school, why not let school come to you? We will be learning at home using computers and discs.
They will never have to leave the house or wake up so early.
Another way our home could be different in the future is probably the utilities we will be using.
We might not need maids to do housework anymore as they can easily be replaced with a robot, a machine, or something else with the same purpose.
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the cuisine.
It will still be filled with vegetables and meat.
This is because people won't give up the great taste of food.
Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
Lastly, I think that all these changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly.
People will be able to adjust and change with the times.
I am writing to you first of all to thank you for the excellent programme that you have given us for the trip to London, especially for planning a visit to the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting.
However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to suggest including this event in the programme.
The show is going to be on Tuesday the 14 of March from 10.00 to 19.00 and we find it very interesting, because we will have the opportunity to see , firstly about the latest fashions, secondly concerning leisure and sports wear and finally about make-up and hairstyles.
In addition to this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for students it is completely free.
We have been talking for hours in our class about the media's treatment of famous people.
Most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere , looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and I don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because they are popular.
Anyway, this is not always necessarily a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, because it gets people talking about him and increases his popularity.
My name is Bao-yu Liao.
I am the representative of our class to write to you.
We are very grateful for .
It is a good programme.
In particular the National Art Gallery is one of the places we would most like to visit.
This is because we are very interested in art.
In fact, some of my classmates have seen an advertisement for the 'London Fashion and Leisure Show'.
Coincidentally the show is in London and on Tuesday March 14, which is during the period we are in London for the three-day programme.
We think it is a great opportunity because we are very interested in art and fashion.
Of course, we are interested in leisure as well.
Therefore, if it is possible, we would like to see the show in the afternoon on 14 March instead of going shopping.
It would be very much appreciated if you could arrange for the programme to be changed.
We look forward to hearing some good news from you soon.
Famous people, such as politicians and film stars, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
We know it does not matter whether they are famous or not; everyone deserves some privacy.
However, as human beings, almost all of us are curious.
We like to know and chat about gossip.
This is why gossip magazines are so popular.
, journalists have to follow them all the time to peep into their private lives to satisfy us.
Therefore, it is impossible for journalists to stop chasing them.
However, journalists should not only think about , because morality and principles are also concerned.
Of course, if everyone paid less attention or , the situation would be better.
I remember in August 1997 Princess Diana dying in the car crash was one of the most disastrous examples.
Although we cannot deny it is our nature - we are curious - we can improve our sense of morality and try to think about the importance of privacy for them.
Actually, I am happy to hear that journalists have learned their lesson from the death of Princess Diana and try to let her children and the Royal family have more privacy.
Let's all leave them more freedom to enjoy their private lives.
We have received the programme.
We'd like to thank you for organising a good programme, and especially for the shopping tour on Tuesday.
Our class is especially interested in the latest fashion and trends.
London is a good place for discovering these things.
We've seen an advertisement for 'the London Fashion and Leisure Show' and all of us are very interested in it.
It's an exhibition of fashions, sportswear, make-up and hairstyles.
We think it is a great opportunity because there are some people in our class who want to study fashion after leaving this school.
And every one of us is interested in fashions and clothes! This exhibition is situated in the Central Exhibition Hall, London.
We've noticed that the exhibition will be on Tuesday, the 14th of March.
Could we change our programme? We'd like to do our shopping tour on the following day (Wednesday afternoon) instead of Tuesday afternoon.
What do you think about our suggestion? Please write back as soon as possible.
We hope to hear from you soon.
I'd like thank you for taking us on a trip to London and having prepared such a good programme, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
There will also be "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" on the 14th of March, which consists of an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
It will be free for us as we are students.
May I suggest an alternative plan? We could go to the science museum on Wednesday morning and to the National Art Gallery too.
We only need wake up earlier and take part of the lunchtime to do both the same morning, but that would allow us to go to the show on Tuesday, because we can use Wednesday's free time to do our shopping.
I hope that my idea is acceptable to you and you'll agree.
Thank you for your letter, as usual, it's a pleasure to receive news from you.
I understand that you're looking for a birthday present for your cousin, and you'd like to give her a book, which, I think, is a good idea.
The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë.
It's a fantastic book, which I recommend to everybody keen on love stories.
It's a perfect combination of passion and life's difficulties.
I reckon that it's not an easy read, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's so good at literature that it won't be a problem for her.
I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personality.
It'll be a good point for her general education.
Wuthering Heights is a classic, which everybody knows about , even if they haven't read it, they at least know the story.
I am writing to ask permission to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
I would be very grateful if you could let us go to the show.
I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw in an advertisement yesterday.
It is at the Central Exhibition Hall in London.
It starts at 10.00 am and finishes at 19.00 pm.
The date of the show is Tuesday the 14th of March.
It will be a really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London.
We would like to go there because it is very popular nowadays.
I've heard that the Leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles are really wonderful.
It is also free for students.
We all know that you have organised everything.
However, we can change the programme.
Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you have.
We have some free time on Wednesday the 15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday.
We can also do our shopping quickly after sightseeing in London.
I would be very pleased if you let us go to the show.
I also would like to say thank you for organising an excellent programme for us.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
That day, I got up early because I hadn't slept very well.
I checked everything again and again.
I was afraid to do it but I had to do it.
It was the first time I had robbed a bank.
I was her best friend.
I promised her I would find the money for her operation.
She was at the hospital and she was really bad.
That time, I couldn't imagine how my life would change.
After I had had my breakfast I put my clothes on.
I didn't want anybody to recognise me.
Despite feeling really bad I left home.
I got into my car and started it.
When I arrived at the bank I got out of the car and went into the bank.
I told everybody to lie down.
They did it.
I asked the cashier to give me all the money.
Before I took the money one of the cashiers had pressed a button to call the police.
I quickly left the bank.
However, it didn't take long for them to catch me .
The policeman arrested me and I was in prison for 15 years.
The worst thing was my friend died 10 days after I was arrested.
I am writing about our class trip to London.
First of all, I appreciate your well-organised programme, especially the "River Trip to Greenwich" which we requested.
It will be the most exciting activity on this trip.
However, I saw the advertisement for "THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW" in the newspaper today, and told all our classmates about it.
We are very interested in going to this show.
So I would like to suggest you change part of the programme so we can visit this show.
This show will be held in the Central Exhibition Hall, London on Tue.
14, March, and is open from 10:00 to 19:00.
We can see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles which we will learn about next term.
Therefore, I think it is a great idea to visit the show for our education.
Furthermore, admission is free for students.
Unfortunately, our programme is fixed but I think we could change part of the programme.
For example, "shopping on 14 March' can be changed to 15 March instead of "Free time".
So we will be able to use the time in the afternoon on 14 March for visiting the show.
I hope that you will give us an opportunity to visit the show.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Some people have said that famous people such as politicians, and film stars, need to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
I strongly agree with this.
Firstly, most people can remember the sad story of "Princess Diana".
She died in Paris a few years ago while she was escaping from lots of journalists called "Paparazzi".
If she had not been followed by journalists, she wouldn't have died.
So, this fact shows obviously that famous people without a private life can become victims.
But on the other hand, ordinary people, including me, are keen on watching film stars or super models .
Moreover, people are interested in their lifestyle.
I think that is the reason why journalists are still chasing famous people after "Princess Diana's" accident.
However, secondly, famous people are not "alien" so they might do something, for example, shameful things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.
So they can be just ordinary people like us.
We have to think about it this way.
Overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people...
and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show that we saw advertised and we are interested in .
In addition we would like to thank you for the programme.
I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going shopping, so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is compatible as well with our programme because by 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.
Some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
I believe that if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results.
For example, politicians have chosen their careers; they must know that and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation, and they will not be considered trustworthy.
.
If somebody is a film star this means that he has got a different kind of life, a more comfortable, more interesting life but it doesn't mean that he or she can't be like normal people even if he or she is a star.
If somebody wants to be famous of course they must be and the mass media will be following him or her.
But I think that there are limits.
Everybody deserves to have a private life even if he is a plumber or even if she is a famous singer.
It doesn't matter what kind of career or job you have.
You must control your behaviour and try not so much yourself.
And finally the journalists should know how to respect the private lives of everyone and not try to make money by using the reputation of famous people.
Firstly, I'm very glad to hear from you.
Thank you for organising the programme for our class.
I think you have thought a long time about how we should study during these three days.
We have seen your programme, and like all of those , especially the Science Museum.
It will be good for us to increase our knowledge, and so on.
All of us want to go to the show.
The generation who are the same age as us all like make-up, , and it's important that it will be free for students and just be for one day.
So, we don't want to miss this chance.
Finally, we would like to get your permission to go.
Maybe if it is possible that you can change your programme, we can go to your college any time after Tuesday.
We're sorry to cause you trouble.
This story happened two years ago.
That was a very hot summer.
All the people in our city liked to swim in the river.
Perhaps they didn't think it was interesting if they swam in the pool.
Personally, I'd like to say I was good at swimming.
Not only was I a member of the swimming team in our school, but also I had been taught by my father since I was five years old.
So I had acquired some skills and learned how to protect myself from my Dad, .
One day, I passed by a river .
I saw there were a lot of people playing in the river.
Suddenly, I heard a cry of "Help, help" in the distance.
In a , lots of passersby crowded at the riverside.
To my surprise, nobody went in to save that boy who was shouting, but just stood there, like lots of "".
I started thinking about it.
After all, .
I was just 15 years old.
Finally, I jumped into the river.
I knew that was dangerous, but I didn't think about anything except .
I also really hated those people who stood there all the time.
Thank goodness, I succeeded in saving that struggling child.
When I got to the river bank, I saw some .
Firstly, I'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us, especially in planning all this programme in such accurate way.
I think that this programme is well-organised, as you know, because we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points.
But I was wondering, as a student of this college, if we could change part of this programme ...
we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock.
In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and then we can go to the show.
From my point of view, we are very interested in the latest fashions like leisure wear, sportswear, make-up, hairstyles, you know ...
I strongly believe that we will be in the best city and at the right time to appreciate it.
Please let me know if you agree with us! Oh I forgot about something! Also, this show is free (another positive point).
Well, you can look at your house ...
Nowadays, we have all kinds of instruments for washing up the dishes, for cooking to be more convenient, for example, the TV, the video recorder, etc.
Maybe, in a few years' time we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, in my opinion, I think these facts will not change our way of life.
We will be able to speed up the running of computer games, for example...
But not in any strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars into aeroplanes...
Therefore, you have to be calm because, as you know, things are developing and in the same way you're changing, too.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that the house of the future will be the house of a new awareness.
It will be a very positive point for opening up our lives.
So, we have the future in our hands! Think about it.
Dear Principal, First of all, we would like to thank you for the good programme which provides us with 3 days' stay in London.
It contains a wide range of activities, for example, sightseeing, a river trip, visiting the science museum and gallery, shopping.
It is certain that the programme will give the students considerable enjoyment.
However, we have found an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure show, which will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th of March.
The advertisement says that the show is full of many interesting programmes, such as the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles etc.
Moreover, students are allowed to attend for free.
All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make-up, so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like.
It would be great if you made a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show.
It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th to the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology.
To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house.
50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food.
Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lives have been far easier than before.
Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off.
Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work.
In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner.
He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house.
On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a "family".
In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves.
A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life.
In our class, we have read an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 March from 10:00 to 19:00.
As we are going to be in London on this date, we think it could be a great opportunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc.
and it is free for students.
Because of this , we would kindly ask you to change the programme so that we could go to this particular event.
We suggest visiting the Science Museum in the afternoon on Wednesday 15 March and cancelling the shopping on Tuesday 14 March.
Hoping for your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
I was having a holiday with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food.
One day we were invited by some locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli.
Although my parents were very happy about having such a special opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.
In this country my parents used to buy water in bottles to have it clean, but in the little town we didn't have the chance to do this and the family where we were staying kindly boiled the water for us.
We spent 2 weeks with the family.
The first week was fine, but in the second week I got very sick.
I think it was the water.
My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one.
Some days later we went back to Dehli and, having been to the doctor and having again drunk bottled water, I was feeling healthy again.
First of all, I would like to thank you for the excellent organization of this trip which seems to be very interesting and useful for the students.
In particular, I believe that the visit to the National Art Gallery will be a really exciting experience for all of us.
All the students are enthusiastic about it.
However, some of them have read an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March.
The Exhibition will show all the latest fashions over a very wide range from sportswear to make-up and even hairstyles.
What is more, the show is free for all students.
We feel that taking part in it would be a great opportunity for us since we will be able to get some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our time.
, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it would be possible to make some changes to the programme if it the exhibition.
It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 7.00pm, so we could give up shopping and go to the show in the afternoon.
This answer is no surprise: famous people cannot have their own private life.
Whenever they go out they are suddenly "hounded" by groups of journalists and photographers who want an interview or a photo.
They cannot even have a pizza with stops them and asks them for an autograph.
But the worst thing of all is that they are often the victim of malicious gossip, which most of the time is not even true.
In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly right that famous people accept their situation, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings.
On the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life like all other people have.
Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depressed: in fact, money and celebrity don't always bring happiness.
Thank you for the programme which you have organised for the three days in London.
However, some students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to have an opportunity to go to the show.
The show is open between ten and seven p.m on Tuesday, March 14, at the Central Exhibition Hall in London.
The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles are expected to be displayed and studied.
We think it a great opportunity to touch a part of the latest cultures, which are concentrated and sharpened in London.
In addition, admission for students is free.
Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we would have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday.
We suppose that during our free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping.
We hope that you consider our suggestion.
The ways of living are always changing.
There is no doubt that the functions and structures of the home have been changing as well as that of .
Thinking about the home of the future, first of all, nuclear families should be expected because of new technologies, which make house-keeping easier and simpler and because of the idea which encourages us to live in cities for a convenient life.
People may tend to .
On the other hand, the bond between parents and children is unlikely to change.
People always need their parents, children and so on.
The longer and they live on their own, the more they may feel that they need a family.
New materials will surely change the home of the future in many ways.
Hopefully, the minds of people will stay peaceful and gentle in the future.
First of all I would like to thank you for organizing the programme.
I read it and found it very good, especially the Science Museum and National Art Gallery as I am interested in arts.
However, I have a great proposition for you.
The students in my class have recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
I think it is a great opportunity for us, as it is at the time of our being in London and is free of charge for students.
The girls would like to see the latest fashions, new make-up and interesting hairstyles.
The boys are interested in seeing leisure and sportswear.
I hope you will consider this proposition and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Home is an important element in everybody's life.
It gives you safety.
I do not know people who would not want to have a home.
We like our houses, that is why we are always trying to make them more comfortable and .
I think the home of the future will be bigger as we will need more room for ourselves, our belongings and interests.
The construction will be more simple, which will give us a feeling of balance.
More houses will have gardens, which will make us feel closer to nature.
Many people think that we will a kitchen, which is a useless place, as we will spend most of the time at work and will eat outside.
I do not think so.
Because of computers, we will have the possibility of working at home, therefore, home will be a very important place worth paying attention to.
First of all, I want to thank you on behalf of the class for your excellent and programme, and especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time.
We really appreciate this.
However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from 10 to 7 o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall.
The latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown there.
This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't ever before been to this kind of show.
As well as this, entrance for students is free.
As you can see this is the best time to go there.
We have some suggestions about how to change the programme.
Instead of visiting the Science Museum on Tuesday we could go there on Wednesday afternoon and instead of going shopping on Tuesday afternoon we could maybe stop at some places during the sightseeing tour and buy something there.
In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press, just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people.
The newspapers print everything about them.
The is searching for every little bit of information they can get.
The photographers are chasing these people just to take a picture of them to show how they eat or with whom they meet.
The photos will be in tomorrow's press and so rumours are born.
On the other hand these people have chosen to walk this path.
Everything in life has a price.
The price for fame and money is the loss of privacy.
First of all you have to give up something to get something else.
However, the press shouldn't create rumours and hunt those people like animals.
As well as this, the stars shouldn't complain at any time about their fans and their loss of privacy.
They wanted to be famous and they knew the price beforehand.
The fans and the press are those who have made them rich and famous.
I am writing to you about the trip to London.
All of the students in my class have read through the programmes that you have devised.
They are quite interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich, because some of us may go to the university there next year.
So we can walk around and see what Greenwich looks like.
All of us want to go on this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we would all like to go there.
It is from 10 am to 7 p.m.
It the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
All of us are really interested, and it is free for students to get in as well.
It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things there.
So would you please reschedule the visit to the Science Museum for Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday.
Yours Sincerely.
It was two years ago.
My classmates and I went on a leadership trip to London.
This trip was organised by our form tutor.
He wanted to test if we trusted each other and worked in a team, and the trip lasted for 3 days.
The first days were fine.
We just had to do some teamwork things.
On the second day, we had to climb up a twenty-metre hill with our hands.
It was so difficult for me because I had been really scared to stand on a high place since I was young.
I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice.
So I started to climb really slow and carefully, and I climbed about 15 metres quite successfully, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away.
But after I climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped .
I nearly fell , but luckily my hand caught a rock.
It was dangerous, but I didn't have any choice.
Finally I did it.
Thank you for the excellent programme you have organised for our class.
We especially look forward to the river trip to Greenwich.
We would like to inform you that we are all extremely interested in this show and that it could be a great opportunity for us because entrance is free for students.
We would like to ask if we could go to this show on the 15th March instead of doing the visit to the Science Museum.
We could do that on the Wednesday, 15th March, in the afternoon.
Thank you in advance for your understanding and we look forward to hearing from you.
Who has never dreamed of being a famous singer, sportsman, actor or a politician? The success of these people is so great that they are known all over the world.
I think that these kinds of people have a poor life because they can never be because everybody knows them and wants to know a lot of things about them.
They always have to be careful about what they say and what they do.
I think that if famous people are always followed by journalists it is not the fault of the media but of the huge number of people who are interested in famous people's lives.
Firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
Secondly, it is because they have a lot of admiration for them and lastly because they want to dream and see what a "star's life" looks like.
I'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London, especially for the river trip to Greenwich.
It will be a great experience for us.
But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", which will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00.
At the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show.
It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions, make-up, and hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends.
There is one more advantage: it is free for students.
So we would like to suggest how the programme could be changed.
First of all on Tuesday we will all go to the show and spend all day there, but on Wednesday in the afternoon when we have some free time we can go to the Science Museum, if you don't mind, of course.
Please let us know as soon as you make your decision.
With best wishes, your student.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I was glad to get it and get a lot of news about you.
First of all I want to wish your cousin a happy fifteenth birthday and wish her all the best.
I hope that it will be a good holiday for her, her family and friends.
Now about your questions, it is very difficult for me to give any advice about it.
I don't know your cousin very well so I don't know what she prefers reading.
But when I was fifteen my favourite book was "The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie".
So I can recommend you give her this book, because it is a very interesting, amusing, sometimes dramatic and mysterious book.
This book helps us to improve our , mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
So I hope I have helped you.
Write to me as soon as you can.
I am writing to express my appreciation for the good programme.
It was so kind of you to have organised the programme.
I would enjoy seeing a show, especially a fashion show.
I am keen on wearing and drawing some clothes.
This show starts on Tuesday in the Central Exhibition of London from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
, entry is free for students! It will be a great opportunity for me.
I feel that it is such a nice experience and worthwhile.
I would like to suggest an idea and change the sightseeing by bus on Monday, because the English weather is so changeable.
If it rains, we will not be pleased.
Some of my friends would like to go to the British Museum and I have not been there before.
I would like to recommend 'The Old Man and The Sea' because I read it when I was teenager.
It was such a wonderful story that I remember the old man speaking about human's life between the sea and the man.
It may make him think of his future and this book could be very suitable for him.
I am writing to you in connection with our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March.
First of all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.
On the other hand, our class has recently seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which takes place during our visit to London, on Tuesday 14th.
This show is a good opportunity to learn about the latest fashions in several areas, like make-up, hairstyles and leisure and sports wear.
We think that it could be a great chance to learn about British fashion and probably it would give us good information for improving our studies.
Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day.
The reason for all of this is the introduction of the "new technologies", such as computers, the Internet or WAP technologies.
Of course, these new technologies will be introduced at home.
Now, it is already possible to by computer, and this , in the next few years, will become the most common one.
The new technologies will probably produce a considerable revolution in some essential parts of the house.
For example, we will have computerized ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have central heating controlled through the Internet from our office.
I am a student from your class and I would like to thank you first of all: it's a good programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery.
A few students and I have heard about a fashion and leisure show.
The show takes place on 14th March from 10.00 - 19.00.
They will show the latest fashion, leisure and sportswear and something for the women: make-up and hairstyle trends.
The show is free for students, and that's also a big advantage.
We have already discussed it and we think it would be a great opportunity because a lot of students are very keen on going.
I know that it involves a change but I have thought about it.
On Monday we could first go to the Science Museum and in the afternoon to Greenwich.
Then we could go sightseeing by bus on Wednesday after lunch.
I think there is no need to go shopping because we can do our shopping in Cambridge.
No one told you to be famous.
If you are famous, it was your choice and therefore it is the price you have to pay.
Of course you have fame and .
But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking in the street.
I am writing, on behalf of the students in my class, to thank you very much for the trip to London.
Besides , we would like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which was advertised in the "Metro" newspaper yesterday.
This show takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14th March from 10:00 to 19:00 .
All my classmates are very interested in this show, which includes the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hair styles.
Moreover, one of the important things for us is that entrance is free for students, because students are generally short of money.
We would like to suggest you change the shopping trip to Wednesday afternoon, because we have some free time on Wednesday afternoon.
We would be very pleased if you would consider our recommendation.
A Private Life For Everyone.
Everyone deserves a private life.
However, most famous people, for example football players and film stars, have not got a private life.
They even have arguments with journalists as they sometimes write inaccurate reports.
On the other hand, some people need journalists to become more famous, because people who are famous can get publicity through journalists.
In conclusion, journalists should respect their lives and always write accurate reports.
I am writing on behalf of my classmates about the programme you have organised for us.
We all want to thank you for having chosen such good places in London.
We are especially excited about the river trip to Greenwich which will be on the first day.
I would particularly like to talk about the second day.
We really like the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will take place on Tuesday and we are very interested in going.
As you know our class is composed of girls and it would be very exciting for us if we could have a look at the latest fashions, makeup and so on.
Although we would like to visit the science museum, we can leave it to the next opportunity.
What we suggest doing is instead of going to the museum in the morning we go to the Leisure Show and keep the afternoon programme the same.
We hope you accept this change .
Last summer I went to the Amazon on an expedition with 10 other people: a guide, a doctor, a scientist & all the rest of us like me were just curious.
We walked all day and rested in the evenings.
We were not allowed to leave our tents during the night or until the day started, because of the dangerous animals which live there.
But for me it was the most exciting moment.
One can be really amazed by the view.
One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without being seen and started walking towards the river, because I wanted to take some photographs of the sunrise.
The view was taking my breath away when suddenly something took my breath away.
It was a panther.
I was petrified because it looked as if it was very hungry.
I knew I could not make any movement for my safety but I did and to my surprise it ran away.
Living in a high building! But we could have everything we want .
Home might be a mixture with modern styles and a natural appearance as well.
These days a lot of countries have been worried about space to build houses.
The prices for land are increasing because of this .
So I think that the future home .
I mean most homes are going to be in a building like a flat.
Maybe it is right to say in a flat instead of a building.
I believe there are a lot of high buildings now in Japan.
Most of them are flats which have at least 20 Floors.
It means the Japanese are planning for the future home.
But what I imagine is that these flats'll have many functions such as offices, leisure centre, shopping centre even school.
Because we are living a computerised life, we'll able to do most things at home or these flats'll have these places as well.
But one more thing, I believe these flats'll have a park for people who'll be living in them.
And because it'll be a big building we'll be able to see a great view through the window.
In conclusion, our future home will have a natural appearance like today's homes and give people a new technological home life.
I have heard you organised such a nice programme, especially the river trip and museum, for our class.
I would like to thank you for doing that on behalf of my classmates.
By the way, our classmates have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and leisure show.
It will show us the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear.
In addition, make-up and hairstyle shows will take place at the same time.
We think it would be a wonderful chance to have a new experience.
What is even better, is that all students can participate without paying.
It takes place at Central Exhibition hall in London.
And it starts from 10 to 19 on 14th of March.
So we would like to suggest you put this event into the morning time on Tuesday instead of the Science Museum and put the science museum into free time on Wednesday.
Our homes will be different in order to protect our family from theives.
For example, now we have a security like a bell or button.
But in the future, we'll use our eyes or finger prints through the special space to enter inside.
That means, our security system will be much stronger.
On the other hand, what might still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace.
Because it is an instinct that people prefer comfortable places and want to take a rest in a peaceful place.
I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you for the programme you organised for our trip to London.
We all think it is a good programme, especially because of the fact that it combines leisure and culture.
However, we saw an advertisement for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go and see it.
First of all, you might not know what this show is about.
, it is a big exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
It would be interesting for us to see all that "live", rather than on TV.
Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for us because entry is free for students so it will not affect the budget.
The show takes place on 14th March from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock.
We all think that it would be most enjoyable to go to the science museum until about 11 o'clock and then move on to the show.
It would be a good idea to leave at about 5 or 6 o'clock so that we can go shopping for a while.
As you are probably aware our English class is going to spend three days in London.
The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have drawn up a very nice schedule for us.
The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but because of the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class have asked me to suggest a change in our schedule.
This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases in sportswear, make up and hairstyles.
I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us.
We would have fun, meet the locals and practise our English at the same time.
Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school.
The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show.
Our free time on Wednesday could be spent at the museum.
You told me your cousin likes suspense books and stories, the ones in which you keep trying to figure out who is the killer.
Agatha Christie's stories just couldn't be more suitable for your cousin.
Especially because there isn't just one story, but a whole lot of them.
Personally speaking, I think they selected the best ones to be published.
As we have seen the advertisement for the programme the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
However, on March 14, there is the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", which is also interesting for us.
As you know all of us in this class are preparing to the art & design school in the next semester.
So this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
Furthermore, most of the famous will be at this exhibition with their new products for the coming season.
We would like to know if all of us can go to this event.
We all agree that we are going on the school trip to the Science Museum, which is the most interesting trip for us.
Anyway, instead of going shopping in the afternoon session, we will attend the show.
This is the solution that we all think will be the least to the other students, as the school do not need to re-arrange the whole trip just because of our special interest.
We hope very much that you understand, and would like to thank you in advance for your cooperation.
We look forward to hearing from you soon.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it.
Even though all of my friends who were with me on that day said, "Just let it go, it's only a puppy.
Why do you have to take a risk?" It seemed that none of them had any sympathy for that lovely blue-eyed puppy that somebody who had no mercy had just left there, on a highway.
 out of the car on the highway where .
It was true that small dog was in danger, but your life would be in that situation as well once you decided to do that brave thing.
My whole body was shaking, and I would almost have turned back to my car if I hadn't heard that small creature cry as if he wanted me to be his owner.
So I just crossed the road, jumped, and picked him up.
I felt like I was a hero at that moment, even though I'd never thought of it before.
We would like to thank you for all the time you have spent in order to organize the programme that we will follow during the three days that we are going to spend in London.
We all believe that it is a great programme, which includes both and free time.
We would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
This show is going to take place in the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday, March 14, between the hours 10.00-19.00, and we would like to ask you if it is possible to go to that show.
We think that this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of make-up and some famous hairstylists.
The show is absolutely free for students.
As a class we suggest going to this show on Tuesday, March 14, in the morning, and visiting the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon during our free time.
If that is possible.
We would all like to thank you again.
In the year 2000 the media is one of the most powerful things on the planet.
The media is everywhere.
Television, radio stations, newspapers, and magazines all have one goal, to inform the citizens.
Some of them, however, are not doing their job probably.
They don't provide people with news, education or documentaries.
They just publish gossip about famous people, such as politicians, musicians and film stars.
I believe all people, famous or not, deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time.
They are humans like all of us, with their problems, their good and bad times, and of course they don't want to publish them in front of millions of people because a journalist thought that this would be right, and good for his pocket.
I think the only way of changing that is if the people show no interest because then the journalist would have no reason to publish any gossip because it would not be watched or read by anyone.
So the power is with the people.
I and all of my colleagues have read your programme, which you organised for us, for our three-day trip to London.
We all think the programme is organised well.
In particular we're so keen on the idea of going to the National Art Gallery, to see the work of the greatest painters in the world.
I'm writing to you because we saw a great advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we really would like to go to see that show.
The show will be in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday, the 14th of March, from 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm.
I think it's a great opportunity, because we will have a chance to see the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, and also .
In my opinion, we can have a great time there, and entrance is free of charge for students, which is very important as well.
I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go to that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to the next day.
I hope you'll think about our proposal and consider changing the programme.
My story begins during my holiday.
It was a nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine decided to go on holiday this year to the seaside.
We thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and .
However, the truth was a little bit different.
Things started happening from the day we arrived.
The weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
Despite that we were still thinking optimistically.
.
We went to a few exhibitions, nightclubs, and restaurants around the area and we really had fun.
Everything was suggesting today was going to be a good, sunny day.
We went swimming.
Then in a few minutes the weather changed and a big storm began.
The sky went completely black, so at first it was difficult to see where everybody was.
I looked around and I realised a friend of mine was still in the sea, and fighting against the storm, trying to get to the shore.
I didn't think.
I just went in to save my friend.
Everything was looking so dangerous but fortunately it ended well.
That was the end of our holiday, and next year we definitely won't be going to the seaside.
Firstly, to thank you for organising a good programme in London, especially the visit to the Science Museum and National Art Gallery.
We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and we can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum.
In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in the National Art Gallery.
Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited these two places before.
So we decided to choose another event .
It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW.
The show will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall, London.
The date is Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00.
It shows the latest fashions, including leisure and sports wear.
In spite of this, there are also make-up and hairstyles, which .
Secondly, the show is a great opportunity because it is held for only 1 day, which is Tuesday March 14.
And it is free for students.
So I think it is worth visiting.
, here are some suggestions about how the programme could be changed.
We can follow the programme that you planned as usual and then we go to that fashion show on Tuesday.
For me, I think people's homes may not be built on the ground.
The homes will be built in the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings.
As the homes will be built in the sky, it will save a lot of electricity as solar energy will be used.
Regarding electrical goods, there will not be any kind of electrical product except computers.
People will do everything on the computer, including watching TV, listening to music, and chatting with people, as the computer is a multi-functional product.
On the other hand, there're some things that remain the same.
The toilet should remain the same as people need to use it daily and nothing can replace it.
Second, there should be friends and family members in the home to provide joy and fun.
Since friends and family members won't change or be replaced by anything.
These are my .
I really wonder how the home of the future will be.
I'm writing to you to thank you for organising our programme for a trip to London.
I'm a student at the College of Economics and I have been chosen to write to you about this matter.
Our class really appreciate your preparing this programme, especially with regard to Monday's .
We are extremely interested in visiting London.
Sightseeing by bus will be a great opportunity for us to get to know the wonderful capital better.
Although we are excited about the , I would like to ask you if it would be possible to change our schedule a little bit.
In the last edition of 'London's Guide' we saw an advert for 'The London Fashion and Leisure Show', which will be held on Tuesday and it lasts from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m.
The offer mentions the 'latest fashions', which we are incredibly interested in.
In addition it also the 'Leisure and Sports Wear'.
The things which attract us the most are 'Make-up' and 'Hairstyles'.
We strongly recommend it, because students' admission is free.
I'm convinced that you will agree with us and we will attend this show.
We would be terribly grateful if you agreed with our suggestion.
Nowadays famous people don't have an easy life.
They are always by naughty journalists, which have a desire to earn big money for writing an extremely good report or article.
To begin with, we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't true.
In addition we are fascinated by their marriages, children, holidays etc.
What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well known.
When choosing this style of life they should realise what their life would be like.
On the other hand, their life has no privacy.
In spite of being incredibly famous, they might feel very anxious and lonely.
They are always under great pressure in their everyday life, because they are afraid of being recognised.
Some people may argue, but I think that politicians and film stars belong to the public.
In conclusion, I believe that we have a right to be informed about their lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
Our class is looking forward to going to London next week.
We find the programme which you've organised very interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
Thank you very much for it.
There is only one thing that we'd like to change, if you wouldn't mind.
We've read an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show which will take place on Tuesday, March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00.
The latest fashions will be shown there and many useful tips about make-up and hairstyles will be given.
According to your programme we have some free time on Wednesday, March 15.
So we'd like to go to a disco and this fashion show would be a great opportunity for us to learn something about styling.
As we are from a small town we don't have any opportunity to learn about this.
We suggest visiting the Science Museum on Monday after the sightseeing tour by bus.
We think we'll have one free hour before the River trip.
It would be a good solution.
We hope you agree with us.
In every country there are famous people who are the centre of public attention.
They are always expected to be beautiful, intelligent, good-looking.
This is very stressful.
To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars and politicians have a right to one.
Otherwise they can suffer problems, and fall into deep depression.
I think that it must be awful to know that you are observed by journalists or other people, your fans for example, 24 hours a day, and all the things you do in your life are published and the whole world knows who your friends are, where you go shopping, who you love and who you sleep with.
In my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen.
I think we should have a little bit of respect for famous people and leave them some time for their private lives.
Firstly, I would like to thank you very much for the excellent programme you have organised for my class.
We are especially looking forward to going on the river trip to Greenwich and to the sightseeing by bus.
Secondly, I have seen an advertisement in the Times about the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It will be held in the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14.
My class and I are all interested in it and we would like to go there to have a .
It will be a great opportunity for all of us because they will the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make-up and different hairstyles.
Furthermore, the admission for students is free.
I have already thought about a change to the programme.
On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time by going shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
It was dangerous but I knew I had to do it.
What was so dangerous and why did I have to do it? Now I will tell you in brief exactly what happened to me.
It was a fantastic sunny day in August and my friends and I took a day off from work.
There were just four of us.
We all decided to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth.
When we got there we were wearing our costumes.
We lay on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volleyball matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming.
For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons and my friends didn't know about that.
I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing at me.
So I took the decision to go and join them as well though I knew that it would be dangerous .
I waded very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends would realize that something was wrong with me.
In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea.
After that day, I decided to take up swimming, so that I would have no embarrassments on future trips to the seaside .
I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion And Leisure Show.
First of all I would like to thank you for making such a good plan for us, so we can have a good time.
Then I would like to explain to you the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
Finally I would like to describe how the programme could be changed.
The London Fashion And Leisure Show is taking place in the Central Exhibition Hall in London and on Tuesday March 14, from ten o'clock in the morning till seven o'clock in the evening.
The reason that I suggest that we go is that it is a great opportunity because we can see the latest fashions, in leisure and sports wear as well as make-up and hairstyles.
In addition to this we will not have to pay anything since it is free for students.
I suggest that we should move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon .
I look forward to hearing from you.
It was dangerous, but I had to do it.
I did not have any choice since my brother was in trouble.
I had to become a burglar again and steal jewellery from the jewellers nearby.
As I knew the techniques to break into a place without being noticed, I should not have been afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country, which was very well protected.
When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily nobody was.
Then I approached the door slowly, broke the lock and opened the door.
However, my adventure was not over yet.
There were lasers all over the place, which I had to be careful of.
Suddenly something went wrong.
The alarm was making a noise.
I ran towards the diamond, grabbed it, got out quickly, and ran out of the back door.
By chance I saw a car waiting for me outside.
I got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
We would like to thank you for the programme which you have prepared for us.
We really like the variety of our trip to London.
The programme offers enjoyment and education, which is essential for young people.
However, we would like to say that recently an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show has been seen by one of your English class students.
The show will be about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
In our opinion, we should go to the show.
Firstly, because we are keen on fashion.
Secondly, because we do not have to pay for the tickets.
We have already organised our visit in a new programme.
The show is on Tuesday and we could go to see the show in the afternoon, instead of going shopping.
We think that we can go shopping the next day, on Wednesday, in our free time.
We are looking forward to hearing from you.
The future is unpredictable and human beings are afraid of dangers, such as tornados or earthquakes.
Thinking about home as a place to live .
We must think about home from another point of view.
We need to make our home a place where we want to come back to after work or school.
It has to be a pleasure to be there for us.
What we really need in the next millennium is love, that is what will keep all the family together forever.
Do we care about a new carpet or fashionable furniture? No, I do not think so.
Life is too short to think about possessions.
Our houses will change because of new technology, which may make our lives more comfortable.
Everything will be faster.
We will get used to that.
What depends on us, is the atmosphere we will have in our houses.
The home of the future, for me, is a place of happiness.
We cannot future technology, but we might still have some feelings for each other.
I would like to travel in July because it is more suitable for me.
I think I will really enjoy it if I can stay in a tent.
It is going to be a new experience and looks exciting.
About the activities while at the Camp, I would like to do swimming, not because I am good at it, just because I am keen on it and the other one is Photography.
I hope .
Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in Portugal.
Everything was new for me.
I had to tidy up the place where they have to wait for their turn.
The group asked me to make sure that in the fridge they always could find a wide variety of drinks including honey and lemon for the throat.
The other thing I had to do was keep an eye on the towels, I mean, dry towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, and they have to change clothes and look fresh; don't ask me why.
The pop concert in a big stadium called "Mararcanã".
Everyone likes sales, but those so-called sale items are not really good value.
In the fashion industry, sales begin at the end of each season and just last a short time, because those retailers want to make room for new stock.
But you'll find your 'cool bargain' soon gets out of date and you have to keep buying new ones.
Also supermarket owners have invested a vast amount of money to find out the best way to place goods in order to get the most profit.
Therefore, we become impulsive buyers easily under the influence of these tricks.
The result is we feel guilty after spending more than we expected, or even suffer from financial difficulty.
I am writing to reply to your letter and to ask for more details about the competition.
Firstly, I would like to say that I'm very glad to have been chosen and I will do my best for this competition.
As you mentioned about the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a tent, because it's more exciting and I really love camping.
I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to choose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good at almost all of these activities.
However, I would choose sailing because I am fascinated with the sea and its mysteries and I also like the water, the wind in my face...
The other one I would choose is basketball because I'm tall and very fast with the ball.
Finally I would like to know what kind of clothes we are supposed to wear there, and about the money we are supposed to bring to pay for food and things like that.
I'm looking forward to receiving your prompt reply.
Although there were 5,000 thousand people there, people could walk and dance without any problem.
It was very well organised.
The show started exactly on time and the group performed well too.
I contributed to the concert by selling some tickets to my friends.
However great the success of the concert, at the end of the show some started a big and some people got hurt.
It was depressing...
I have just received your letter which made me so happy.
I cannot believe that I won first prize in your competition, because I have always believed I am an unlucky man and now I think some things are changing in my life.
I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have a one-month break in July, so please book my log cabin for July.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I had some experience of tents in my childhood and it was not a very good experience, therefore I would like to stay in a cabin.
You say in your letter I can do two activities from the list which features many exciting activities.
I would definitely choose basketball and swimming which are my dream sports.
I used to play in the school team when I was in high school and our team was one of the best basketball teams in the whole county and I am also very good at swimming.
I am looking forward to your letter .
I have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowadays there are some people who are called shopaholics.
They are just like alcoholics and these people because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
I cannot believe how they do this every day, even when I need something at home I always try to find something to use instead .
Because nowadays wherever you go there is a big queue and I hate waiting.
The queues are not the only problem.
If you go by car there is the problem , if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat .
If you go shopping for clothes that is the worst kind of shopping.
Especially if you want to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl, you have to be ready to spend hours trying on clothes.
I really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they go into a shop they want to try on every single item of clothing and they do not realise the time.
Some people say "shopping is not always enjoyable" but for me it is definitely unenjoyable and I think it will be the same for the rest of my life.
I would like to travel in July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes.
About the activities, I would like to do Basketball and Surfing.
I play Basketball at school twice a week and I enjoy it.
Although I do not play perfectly, I play quite well, but I would still like to practise.
I go to the beach almost every weekend to improve my surfing - it is the sport I like best - and I think it would be a nice opportunity to practise surfing too.
There are some things I would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of Clothes I will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
Well, that is all.
I look forward to receiving your letter.
In the tale "It's a good life", the author gives much more emphasis to Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story.
He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and .
He controls the other people using the power of his mind.
Although the other people in the story are the good ones and suffer from his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told to us by the author.
In conclusion, even though we know that this character is good and this one is bad, sometimes the good ones are quite boring, and we find the bad ones much more interesting.
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN ORDER TO GIVE A REPLY TO THE KIND LETTER I RECEIVED FROM YOU.
I CANNOT EXPRESS HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS BEAUTIFUL PRIZE.
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE ONLY TIME I WILL BE ABLE TO TRAVEL IS IN JULY, BECAUSE BEFORE THEN I HAVE TO TAKE SOME EXAMS AT UNIVERSITY.
IN YOUR LETTER YOU ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD PREFER A TENT OR A LOG CABIN.
WELL, THE ANSWER IS A LOG CABIN, BECAUSE I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY BACK.
THAT IS WHY I CANNOT SLEEP ON THE GROUND OR IN A SLEEPING BAG.
BY THE WAY, YOU ALSO MENTION THAT I WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO DO TWO ACTIVITIES.
WELL, THE TWO ACTIVITIES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CHOOSE ARE BASKETBALL AND SINGING.
I HAVE CHOSEN THOSE BECAUSE I AM QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL AND I SING EVERY WEEKEND IN THE CHOIR OF THE LOCAL CHURCH AS WELL.
FINALLY, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU LET ME KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO TAKE SOME CLOTHES OR MONEY.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF I WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR ANY OTHER EXTRA ACTIVITIES.
I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL MY QUERIES.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.
AS YOU KNOW, I AM A SOUND TECHNICIAN, SO I HELPED THEM TO SET UP THE SOUND EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY.
THEN SOME HOURS BEFORE THE CONCERT, I MET THE BAND AND THEY LET ME STAY FOR THE SOUND CHECK.
IT WAS A REALLY SPECIAL TIME FOR ME! THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND WERE VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY TO ME.
THEN, WHEN THE CONCERT STARTED, THE ORGANISERS GAVE ME AN IDENTITY CARD, WHICH WAS ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE STAFF.
THAT CARD WAS THE BEST THING THAT SOMEONE HAD EVER GIVEN TO ME, BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO BE ON THE STAGE WITH THE WHOLE BAND! IT WAS THE BEST TIME OF MY LIFE.
I FELT REALLY LUCKY.
.
I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU.
I HAVE SENT YOU SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF ME WITH THE BAND.
Thank you very much for your letter, which informed me that I have won the first prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Here is some information as requested.
Please note that I can only travel in July because of the summer holiday shut-down.
It could be any day but please let me know nearer the time.
I would prefer the log cabins to tents.
I think the log cabin is more fun & exciting.
The activities that I would like to do are painting and playing Golf.
I won first prize for painting when I was at High School, and won third prize playing Golf for a Charity.
Could you please tell me what sort of clothes I need and how much money to take.
I look forward to hearing from you and if you need more information, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Shopping is an ordinary .
We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruit, milk etc.
most people will do their shopping twice a week for fresh food.
You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it is always enjoyable.
You have to try to park your car first, and sometimes the car parks are full and after you have parked your car and got into the supermarket the product you wanted has run out so you have to change your plan for dinner or go to another supermarket to face a long queue.
That makes which was not fun at all.
I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my exams.
I will take the F.C.E at the University of Cambridge and other exams in several subjects at my high school.
I prefer to stay in tents because it reminds me of my first school.
It was great.
By the way, I do not like to be alone.
I would like to have lots of people near me.
Among those activities from which you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting.
I have just attended classes in them.
My father was a great singer and he has been helping me.
Painting is a challenge because it is very hard for me.
But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it.
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear there and how much money I will spend.
I want to know if I can take my cellular phone, too.
Women love shopping.
I am a woman so I love it a lot.
Every weekend I and my boyfriend go to the B.H Shopping Center.
I live in Site Belo and he lives near the B.H.
Shopping Center.
I retired four years ago and my life is very boring.
When I am very sad I like to buy something and sometimes it makes me happy.
I bought a lot of shoes, clothes and books last week.
He was with me and suddenly he became very angry.
He told me that I was very stupid.
I tried to buy a handsome suit for him but he shouted and abandoned me with my bags.
I took a cab and went to my house.
I cried a lot because my life is really very stupid.
I decided to stop buying those things that I don't really need.
I intend to continue studying and return to work because when our life is empty everything looks ugly and sad.
I know deep in my heart sometimes shopping is not enjoyable.
But I am a woman.
We are different.
We need different things to men.
Yesterday he called me and told me that he loves me, anyway.
I believe him because he is a great man.
I hope that he forgets about my shopping.
And I decided I will go shopping alone.
At last I am really a great woman and I love myself.
I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much for that.
Here is the information you want, I hope it is useful.
First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June.
And in August, I have to go back to school to do some class work and I have got a camp to organise.
So I would like to travel in July.
Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation to be in tents.
Since I haven't been camping in tents I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what it is like.
About the activities, I chose swimming and climbing.
I am in the swimming team at school and I won a prize last month.
Although I'm not good at climbing, I want to experience it for myself.
I would like to ask what is the weather in the USA like and what kind of clothes should I wear.
And I was wondering how much money I have to take.
Also, if I can go climbing, what do I have to bring? Lastly thank you very much for answering my questions.
It was lovely to hear that you want to hear about my experience.
I helped at the concert, which was my favourite singer's concert.
But it was a good experience for me because I learnt how to calm down and play well in front of the audience at the concert.
And also I have never played the piano with singers before, and that makes me more confident and has improved my skills a lot.
When the concert finished my favourite singer talked to me & they invited me to play the piano in their next concert and they said that because I performed well in that concert.
They taught me a lot about playing piano as well.
Lastly, thank you for sharing my experience.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I am really happy to get such wonderful news from you.
In order to claim the prize, I would like to travel, if it is possible, in July because I am a student and my summer break is during that month, July.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I have not really had good experiences of camping in tents.
Last time a bear came inside while I was in the tent.
I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp.
By the way, my team and I won the last school championship.
I play guard on my team.
I also like tennis but I am not very good.
I was wondering if you could give me some lessons while I am there.
I do not have words to express how happy I am.
I would like to thank you and Camp California for this opportunity.
Hoping to hear from you soon.
Since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive.
In ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.
Nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practise this ancient art but in a different way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have developed such an instinct for shopping that we can proudly say that we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle.
If an activity has stayed with us, mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it, that is the greatest of ecstasies.
But where is the bad part of it? Well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example, when hundreds of people go to the shopping centre and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
Anyway shopping is with us and it will stay with us for a long time.
I received your letter and I am writing to give you the information you asked for.
First of all I would like to travel only in July because I am going to work in August to earn money and after that (from September to June) I go to university as usual.
About accommodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer to nature.
I choose climbing and sailing for the activities.
Although I have never climbed (so I am a complete beginner), I am very interested in learning to climb.
I sailed a long time ago so I am quite a beginner at that too.
I was happy to receive your letter and, as you asked me, I will tell you about my experience and how great it was.
The most exciting thing when you help at a pop concert is that you can meet popstars, and, indeed, I met OUR favourite popstar! I talked to him and we ate a sandwich together talking about his album.
I will never forget that moment.
But don't worry, I thought about you and he signed an autograph for you.
You will find it with this letter.
On the other hand I worked very hard because the concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the hall and you can't imagine how dirty the fans are! But I could stand up on the stage and talk with the musicians.
When I have received the photos I took, I will write to you again to give them to you.
I feel very happy to be the winner of your competition.
I would like to travel in July only, because they will need me at work in August.
I would like to do singing and swimming.
Regarding the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very little experience in it.
Going shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has many disadvantages.
First of all, shopping is tiring because of the people who are doing the same thing as you the same day! Especially If you go shopping on a Saturday, when people are .
The streets are crowded and you can't walk easily.
You are the people who are so close to you that you can't walk as fast as you want.
Secondly, shopping is stressful, especially if you have to find a particular item of clothing for a special day and nothing fits you.
It can be discouraging.
Or if you look for a present and you can't find it.
Finally, shopping can help you to feel happy if you are down in the dumps, if you feel horrible.
For instance, if you try on an item of clothing which fits you well, it can contribute to making you feel better.
If it is possible I would like to travel in July because school is finishing on the 28th June and I have already accepted a job for August.
I think it would be fun to stay in a tent those two weeks.
I have never done that before, but my friends told me that I would enjoy it.
As you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones I want to do, but I decided to take swimming and photography, because I am very good at swimming and because I am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
I am not very experienced but I think that I will find a lot of beautiful in the USA.
It would be very kind if you could inform me about how much money I have to take with me and what clothes I will need.
Thank you for the card you wrote to me.
I hope you enjoyed your holidays.
I spent some great days in Vienna where I had the chance to help at the Pearl Jam concert.
The first thing I did, together with a friend of mine, was to check the tickets of the fans who came to the concert.
There was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK, because there really were thousands of people.
I'm writing to reply to your questions about Camp California.
First of all, thank you very much for giving me such a good opportunity.
I'm very pleased and I'd like to go to the States as soon as possible, however I'm free only in July.
Currently I'm studying in England and the school finishes at the end of June.
After that I will go back to Japan and continue studying at College, but it starts at the beginning of August.
As for the accommodation, I would prefer log cabins.
I'm not the kind of person who can easily fall asleep and it gets worse when I am in a tent.
At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf.
I belonged to a climbing club at my high school and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher.
I often climbed mountains when I was in high school.
My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practising centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent for golf.
Lastly, I'd like to ask you some questions.
That is how many and what sort of clothes I need and how much money I should bring.
I think we should follow our time table if we make a video about daily school life, but we cannot film every lesson so I picked out some interesting ones.
Firstly, we should definitely put the news review lesson in, because we start every morning with that class and it is where we have a lot of discussion.
Secondly, I think the FCE class should be filmed.
Most of us (students) came to our school because they wanted to study English, so it should be the important part.
In addition, if we film the class, people can see how interesting or funny the lesson is.
Then why don't we film our lunch time because it is also important, isn't it? I think we should film it at the very crowded moment so that people can see we have to wait patiently before we reach our food.
I think, next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
My name is Steven.
I was very surprised when I got the letter from you and heard that I have won the prize to go on a camp in California in the U.S.A.
for one week.
And you need some information from me.
About when would I like to go, I think I would love to go in July, because it is a good time for camping and the weather is lovely at this time of the year.
Now let's start with shopping at the Beverley Centre.
The Beverley Centre area is the place that the teenagers like to go shopping at the most.
But some teenagers like to go to Bolton Market.
Because everyone if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too many people everywhere, like in the restaurants and shops.
It makes you feel you want to go home.
And about the traffic, sometimes it makes you feel you don't want to go out because of the traffic.
And if you never shopping is not enjoyable for you I am sure.
And shopping in the market is one thing that I am not going to do, because all the smells in the market are awful - there is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the .
.
And that's why sometimes shopping is enjoyable, because of the place and people.
At present, I am taking my exams and am fully occupied with studying.
However, I will be free in July - but please note that this is the only time I'll be free to travel to California.
I would also like to take tennis and painting activities while staying at the camp.
I've played tennis for eight years now and have competed in many matches.
I take painting as my hobby as well, even though I have never taken proper lessons.
Two hours before the concert began, I arrived at the hall.
God, I was so excited! Already everything was set up, the group's instruments, lights, microphones...
I quickly helped others to decorate and to 'polish' off the hall - we blew up as many balloons as we could and sprayed them gold and silver.
First of all I would like to thank you for your generous award.
I have been dreaming of a holiday for such a long time.
Now I have the opportunity so I shall inform you fully.
I would like to travel in July because I will be working for the rest of the summer.
I would like to stay in a log cabin, since I can't sleep in tiny, narrow areas.
I have been sailing in the Mediterennean for eight years and I have been playing tennis for four years so I would like to choose sailing and tennis as activities.
What's my ? I would really appreciate it if you could write back.
I received your letter.
I do not want to keep you curious any longer.
The opportunity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance.
I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert.
I, of course, jumped at it.
The idea of meeting a pop singer known worldwide just made my heart punch my ribcage.
The concert was already filled up with thousands of , although it was really early.
We, the volunteers, first unravelled the cables, and set up the microphones and some instruments.
Then we were told go  backstage and make sure everything was perfect.
After a fantastic concert, I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears.
She is a very nice person.
I managed to scavenge an autograph for you as well, I will put it in the envelope.
I am writing because I received your letter saying that I won first prize, a two week holiday at Camp California in the U.S.A, and that you need further information from me.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month I have holidays in.
About the activities, I have chosen basketball because I enjoy playing it, and also because I know how to play very well.
I used to be the captain of the basketball team in my school, because I was the best player, and I think I can still remember how to play.
The second activity I chose was tennis.
I am not so good, but I know how to play.
I have played several times with my friends.
To finish I would like to ask you for toiletries like, for example, shampoo, soap, etc.
So that I don't have to carry them in my luggage.
I think they would just occupy extra space.
Another thing I would like to ask you for is money.
I think it will be an expensive trip and I don't have enough money to pay for it.
Nevertheless I need money for restaurants and thesouvenirs that I can buy in the Camp.
I think that's all, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Shopping is not always enjoyable because of several factors.
Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not attended to.
The people that work in the shop are doing other things and cannot help you, so you have to look for the things you want to buy on your own.
I think this is a common problem in shops, and that's why sometimes people leave the shop without buying anything, and I think the solution would be to hire more workers.
The third and last factor would be when you like a certain type of clothes, and you don't find any of that kind.
You just find the type of clothes you would never wear.
This situation is very annoying for most people, and that's what makes shopping unenjoyable.
I am very happy to answer your letter, which I received this morning.
I am very excited by the wonderful news.
Well, I am starting to make a plan for my trip, and the only time I have is in July because I will have finished my language course at St Jame's School.
About accommodation I would prefer a cabin, because I suffer from allergies, and I think a tent would not be very suitable for my health.
I am very happy to have the opportunity to do some sports.
I'm very good at swimming and surfing.
I won last summer's swimming competition in the school.
Although I'm not very good at surfing I like it, and I always practise on my holidays every year.
I'm very grateful to hear from you.
It's wonderful that you are going to attend a pop concert.
I'm sure you will enjoy it.
You asked me to tell you about my experience helping at the concert last week.
Well, let me tell you, first of all I was very nervous.
You know it was my first time at such an event.
I was asked to put all the chairs in order for the singer.
This was only in the beginning.
After that I needed to check all the microphones.
However, I was not very sure I enjoyed this.
After that all the singers arrived and I was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to drink.
You can imagine how excited I was, especially because I always wanted some photographs of them and this was a special moment and I realised I hadn't brought my camera.
I was very sad.
Well, Kim, remember if they ask you to help go.
You will see how wonderful an experience it is.
I would like to travel there in July, because I can only have holiday in July.
In June and in August I will have to work, so it would be rather impossible for me to join Camp California then.
I would like to have accommodation in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent.
So if I could choose I would like to stay in a log cabin.
Being at the Camp I would like to swim and to play tennis.
I have been swimming for 10 years and I have played tennis since I was 9 years old and I like those activities best.
I think I am best in horse riding; I even have my own horse, so if it is possible I would like to ride horses at Camp California.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
It was a bright, sunny day.
I woke up early in the morning and I decided to go shopping.
- What is your size - said the shop-assistant.
- Och, I am very sorry, but we have run out of size 36.
I was going to the chemist to buy some eye-shadow, when I saw black, suede shoes.
Those shoes must be mine! - I thought.
I went in and I asked the shop assistant if I could try them on.
- I am very sorry but we do not have 38.
I was very angry.
I had some money, I wanted to spend it, but?! Everything did not suit me! It was enough! I came back home - tired and angry.
Surely it was not the best day for shopping.
I did not buy anything, although I tried.
So as we can see - shopping is not always enjoyable.
About the accommodation, I would rather stay in a log cabin.
I am not that much of a "nature" person and besides I have been feeling a little sore for the last few days and it would be better for my back than a sleeping bag.
I would like to play tennis and go surfing.
I must say I am quite good at tennis.
I started playing very young, and I've never stopped playing it since then.
I couldn't say the same about surfing though.
I've done it only twice in my entire life but I really enjoyed doing it.
And one last thing, I would like to know about what kind of clothes I should take, if I have to take some money with me and if there are any expenses I have to cover at the camp.
Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing well, I am and so is my family and everything around here.
You are not going to believe what happened last month!!! I helped Korn at a concert they had at the Auditorium.
I met this guy at a party.
His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy.
Maybe you will meet him one day.
So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert.
Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they wanted.
The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them.
We even had our pictures taken with them and they gave us their autographs.
It was so much fun, we had a great time that night.
Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all.
Please write back.
Love, Lolita.
I received your letter, so I am writing to you to give you some information about me.
I would like to travel in July because I finish school in June and I go to Great Britain in August for one month.
If I can choose my accommodation, I prefer staying in a tent.
I prefer this accommodation because I think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
I want to play tennis and to go swimming.
I haven't played tennis before, so I am not good.
I go to the swimming pool two times a week, so I am good at this sport.
There are a lot of activities and lessons at our school, so I think it's difficult to choose some of them.
I think the best choice is to show many types of activities.
We could show the team spirit of our school through sports activities like soccer, basketball or handball.
We could also show cultural activities: there are a lot of music clubs and painting clubs in our school.
I think it could be interesting to show how students work to write the school newspaper.
At the end, we can also show where we can be relaxed.
We should film our pub and a roomful of students.
All these activities which should be filmed are part of our daily life at our school.
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE NEWS ABOUT MY PRIZE.
REGARDING YOUR QUESTIONS I WOULD RESPOND THAT JULY WOULD BE THE MONTH I COULD GO TO THE CAMP, BECAUSE MY JOB FINISHES AT THE END OF JUNE.
THAT WAY I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE CAMP.
TO ANSWER YOUR NEXT QUESTION, I WOULD RATHER STAY IN A LOG CABIN.
THE THING IS, I HAVE A PHOBIA ABOUT INSECTS AND MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD SLEEP IN AN ENCLOSED AREA.
REGARDING THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT ACTIVITIES MY ANSWER WOULD BE CLIMBING AND SWIMMING.
I CHOOSE THESE TWO ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I USED TO DO THEM A LONG TIME AGO AND BESIDES I WOULD SAY I HAVE THE SKILLS AND ABILITY TO DO THEM.
ONE MORE THING THAT IS CONCERNING ME AND WHICH YOU DIDN'T MENTION.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF IT'S NECESSARY TO TAKE MONEY, FOOD AND CLOTHES WITH ME.
NOW THAT THE STUDENTS HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THIS YEAR TO MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT THE BEST LESSONS AND ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE IN SCHOOL, .
IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO THAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON OUR WRITING AND CULTURE LESSONS.
FOR CULTURE LESSONS WE DON'T NEED TO GO SO FAR BACK IN TIME; FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS OUR CULTURE HAS BEEN CHANGING ENORMOUSLY AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS, WARS, CARS, WEAPONS, ETC....
I have received a letter from you saying that I have won the first prize in your competition and you need some information from me.
I would like to travel in July because my holidays are only in that month and the weather in California is better then.
I am that kind of person who enjoys having a wild and simple life, so I prefer to stay in tents.
About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball, which I have a lot of experience playing.
The second one is sailing, but I am not so good at this sport.
In your last letter you said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert.
I enjoyed it very much.
It was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound.
They liked me so much and invited me to be responsible for the lights and sound.
I told them that I will think about it but I believe I will accept the job.
The most incredible part was the laser show.
They were drawing a lot of things in the sky during the concert.
Next time I'll take you and your friend Monica.
I'm sure that you are going to love it.
I'm very excited because I won the first prize and my family is very proud of me.
About the things you asked me in your letter, I would like to go to camp California in July because that's the month when term ends and I have my vacations and I think it would be much easier that month.
About my accommodation at the camp, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more comfortably.
The activities that I would like to do are singing, because my friend told me that I'm good at it, and the other activity that I would like to do is climbing because I think it is very exciting although I have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
I appreciate the opportunity that you are giving me and I'm very grateful to you guys.
Dear Kim I'm having a great time here in Brazil, I have been going out with some friends and now I have a girlfriend.
She's very nice and very Pretty too.
Well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "Los Jagoares", they sing pop music.
And they are one of my favourites and as you know I have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if I would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc...
and I said, "Sure man." That night I went to the stadium and I met the singer.
His name is saul Hernañdez and he is very funny.
That night I had a lot of fun with them and of course I was in the first row at the concert.
It was the best day of my life.
I hope you are having fun and that you are OK.
Your friend Henrique.
I am writing in order to give you some further information that you required for Camp California.
First of all, I would like to travel only in July due to my work commitment.
I am only allowed to take holiday in July.
As requested, I have chosen two activities - sailing and surfing.
I am quite experienced at surfing - I have participated in some competitions - whereas I am not at all experienced at sailing.
I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp.
Also, I would like to know if there is going to be a qualified instructor for activities since I am a beginner at sailing as mentioned before.
I have thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
I helped people setting up and decorating the concert hall which was great help for my major subject - You know that my subject is design.
I also had to distribute the flyers.
What I particularly enjoyed was meeting the famous musicians I have been dreaming of seeing.
The day I shook their hands, I will never forget that day.
Write soon and let me know what you have been doing.
I'm very much surprised to receive your letter announcing the winner of the first prize in your competition and I'm looking forward to spending two weeks at Camp California.
Because I'm studying at the moment and I won't have my holidays till July, that is the month that best suits me.
The second week of July would be perfect to start my trip.
I would rather sleep in a log cabin.
I think it will be much more comfortable than a tent.
The leisure activities sound fantastic, especially climbing and photography.
I'm very keen on climbing.
I joined a climbing club in my town for 2 years ago and have reached the top of several middle-high mountains.
The other activity I would like to try is photography.
I have no previous experience of it but I want to learn a lot.
This is a report to plan and suggest ideas for the daily-life video at school.
The activities suggested are written below.
The opening of the school, recording the students while they meet outside the school and come in, could be a good beginning.
It would reflect the atmosphere when they meet early in the morning.
Filming lessons such as grammar lessons and would give a general idea about a day at school and how students work on their lessons.
Why don't we include some sports, for example, volleyball? The team has been training very hard during the last weeks.
And they'll certainly feel very proud of being in the video.
The music lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among students from all courses.
Practically the whole school would appear on the video.
I think that if we mix lessons with sports activities the combination will give us complete success.
My name is Alois Blau and I'm very happy that I've won this competition.
Unfortunately I can only travel in July, because I have to attend school until June the 30th and in August I have to work in an office to get some work experience.
I hope that's possible.
I would prefer staying in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is .
A log cabin doesn't sound like a camping holiday.
It sounds like a summer holiday on the coast of Italy.
From the activities you've offered I want to do golf and surfing.
I've never done either in my life, so I am a complete beginner at playing golf and at surfing.
But the reason I want to try these two activities is their image.
Golf is played by wealthy people, a town's upper class, and surfing sounds like freedom.
I hope all my wishes are realisable.
In my opinion shopping is not always enjoyable.
Very often, for example on Friday afternoon or Saturday, there are so many people in the shopping centre that you can't move forwards or backwards.
Many people say that this is real shopping, when you queue for hours only to pay for a pair of socks or a bottle of mineral water at the supermarket.
I think you can't really enjoy shopping when there are hundreds of people and everyone wants to buy something.
I am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and I would be very  to give to you the information that was requested in your letter.
About the Accommodation, I would like you to take careful consideration of the fact that I am asthmatic ,so I would appreciate it if you could reserve a bed in a log cabin.
Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can get involved during the camp.
I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourite ones.
I have recently finished a three-year course in painting and I have always been fascinated by photography.
 I would also like to know about some further details like whether we need to bring some clothes with us or whether they will be provided for us and if we need some money in case we have to buy something.
The activities lasted almost 2 and a half days.
The first day we had to go to the airport to bring all the equipment by lorry to the camp.
It was really awful and hard.
I finished the day extremely tired.
However, the second day was less than the first one.
We just worked on building the stage and all that sort of thing.
Putting the instruments in the right place, testing all the microphones as well as the sound was the rest of the job.
At the end I must confess that it was really amazing all the equipment, which varied from small microphones to a marvellous huge black TV screen.
If you have this opportunity one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like this just to get a free pass.
 to your family.
Write to me soon.
Thank you for your letter informing me that I have won the competition.
Below are the answers to the questions that you have asked me.
Firstly I will only be able to travel in July because my class starts the month after .
Secondly, although the log cabins appeal to me, I would prefer a tent because I think it is more comfortable and attractive.
Finally I would like to do basketball and swimming, because in my school I used to do those sports a lot.
I still do so even now at a sports center, but not much.
Let me know what kind of clothing I have to take with me as well as how much money we will need.
Nowadays most people are attracted to shopping centers, which are not always enjoyable.
So, I have some opinions about this, which I would like to tell.
First of all, I think people have to be careful about the things that they buy because probably are not good quality, which is very annoying.
Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and not spend it on things that they don't need, because by the end of the month they won't have any money.
Finally I think the shops' products are good quality and reasonably priced, but sometimes the shop's staff is not very friendly to you.
I don't think it's very nice to buy things there, with these people.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July only because I have two months' holiday which are July and August.
I choose July because it is the only month that I think I'm free.
In August I have to work .
Secondly, I prefer the tents because I've never been in a tent so I would like to try.
Thirdly, for the activities I would like to choose climbing and photography.
I have never done them before.
The only reason is I would like to try and I think they are matching activities.
When you climb the mountain you can take photographs of the views.
Finally, I would like to ask you about money and clothes.
How much money do I have to bring? And what is the weather like? What clothes suit the weather.
Shopping is when people go to the shops and buy what they want.
However, I think this word is for women because they like beautiful clothes and all sorts of things.
Anyway, shopping is not always enjoyable as the title states because firstly you will get tired because you have to walk in and out the shops.
Secondly you will get angry at the bad manners of the assistants in the shop.
Thirdly, if you're fat you won't find your size.
Fourthly, that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself.
I think if you have lots of money and don't know what to do with it, do not go shopping give the money to charity.
That is better than shopping.
In my opinion it is true it is boring.
It might be because I am a boy.
Thank you very much for the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
In the following there is some further information from me.
I would like to travel only in July, because I have so many assignments to finish before the end of June.
I do not think I have enough time to prepare to travel before July.
, I really do not mind staying in log cabins, but I have never stayed in a tent before.
I think it might be fun to try to stay in a tent this time.
I would prefer to choose tennis and swimming.
I used to be a tennis player when I was fifteen.
I won first prize two years ago.
The other activity is swimming.
I started to learn when I was five years old.
I was a swimming teacher for a year in a sports club.
Now I own a swimming school and train the staff every week.
I think both activities I have chosen are suitable for me and I am sure I can do well.
What type of clothes should I bring with me? And is there any equipment I need to bring with me? I would like to know how much money I need to spend while camping.
Thank you very much for your letter, which I just got last week.
How are you? I hope you are having a nice summer now.
I wondered who had told you that I helped at a pop concert last month.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now who told you, but I was very happy and enjoyed it.
Well, I am going to tell you about it.
First of all, I had to be trained by the concert staff for a day.
Before the concert started I had to help the staff prepare a stage, doing things like putting the instruments where they should be on the stage.
And then, I had to help the singer to put on some make-up.
I was very frightened I might put too much make-up on their faces, but everything was all right.
After that, I had to help them to prepare some lunch when the concert started.
I was running around to find something I could do, like serving some drinks for the staff or the singers.
After the concert finished I had to help them clean up everything.
I was so tired, but happy.
I really like to help people without getting something back.
I was so proud of this experience and very happy.
I don't think I wasted my time at all.
I spent my free time helping them and it made my life a little bit busy.
I think I have learnt a lot from this experience.
When helping people you should not expect anything back , except happiness and enjoyment.
Well, I think I must stop writing now.
I hope you enjoyed hearing about my experience.
I hope to see you sometime next month.
In addition, I've just learnt from your letter that I can do some sporting activities during the camp.
I'm very happy about thisbecause I spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
But, after starting to work, I haven't had any opportunity to play basketball.
Now, you are giving me an opportunity.
As my second activity, I would like to choose photography, because my education included photography.
I love taking photographs of nature.
Meanwhile, I'd like to ask you some questions.
When I come, what kind of clothes would I be able to wear there? And also, how much money do you think I'll need for two weeks? I'm looking forward to your answers.
Yours sincerely.
Hello! I hope you're finebecause these days I'm very happy.
I would like to write about a pop concert which I went to last week.
It was a very good experience for mebecause it was a very different kind of pop music.
They mixed up our traditional music and pop music.
I would like to hear about what's happening in your life, as well.
Take care...
In reply to your letter received on the 13th of June, I first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been chosen.
First of all, you've asked me when I want to travel.
In fact there would be only one possibility in July because I will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of August.
To continue with the other information you need, I would prefer to sleep in a tent because of its proximity to nature.
Furthermore, I've chosen two activities, which are sailing and climbing.
I climbed for 3 years while I was at school and I think that my standard is still not too bad.
Conversely, I've never sailed in my life and would enjoy starting at Camp California.
To end , I would like to know how much money we will need for the free time and what kind of clothes and equipment do I need to do the activities I've chosen.
I would like to thank you for everything, and am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.
I've received your last letter and want to thank you for the pictures you enclosed.
You've asked me how the Leysin Rock Festival was, but I still cannot find the words to explain how fabulous and it was.
As you know, I was there to help with the running of the concert and there were a lot of different things to do.
First, I had to check the tickets at the entrance.
In addition, there were some VIPs to place.
Then, during the concert, I helped to serve the beers at the bar.
I met a lot of interesting people while I was serving drinks.
Furthermore, I had to make announcements over the loudspeaker for the children who were lost.
Everything was very interesting, but what I particularly liked about the experience was the .
I met a lot of different people and they all taught me something new about behaviour or compassion.
I hope we will see each other as soon as possible and I am waiting for your reply.
I would like to travel in June as I have already arranged a part-time job for later this summer.
I prefer to stay in a tent so I go camping every summer and am used to sleeping in tents.
From the list of activities, which was provided by you, I'd like to choose photography and swimming.
I'm very good at swimming as I have been a member of various swimming clubs since I was 6 and I chose photography because I have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it.
Finally I would like to ask you to let me know how much money & what kind of clothes I have to take with me.
Introduction: a short video about daily life at our school I have spent some time discussing it with other students, and observing and analysing an average day in our school and have come up with some suggestions.
Places to video: We should try to video not only classrooms but also our playground, cafe, sports hall, art club & library.
Most students spend a lot of their time in such places and they are a very important part of our school life.
Activities to video: We should show students during their formal studies as well as after lessons.
I think it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the annual sports tournament or welcoming evening for new students.
Conclusion: To sum up the above I'd like to suggest not filming anything longer than 1 or 2 minutes and having a nice mixture of places, faces and events.
If you have any further comments or questions regarding this matter please let me know.
Firstly, I can only travel in July, as it is then that I am on holiday from my present job.
About the activities I can choose from, I would be delighted if I could sing, because it is something that I have always loved and, although perhaps I should not say it myself, I think I have a nice voice.
I am also very fond of photography, so when I saw that it is among your options it was a wonderful surprise.
Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes are more suitable for that time of the year at the camp, the amount of money that, more or less, I would need to bring with me and if there is any cooking equipment to cook the meals ourselves.
I friend of mine had been helping at a few concerts before, so that time the agency rang him and asked him if he could bring someone else, because they'd run out of staff.
He asked me to go and when he told me the group was Radiohead I felt like the luckiest person in the world (you know I've always been an enthusiastic fan of them, so you can imagine how excited I was).
I couldn't wait for it.
But the most amazing thing happened later, when, ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from backstage.
For a while I thought it was a dream.
The music was excellent, the audience enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, ten metres from my favourite group.
I even got a few friendly words from the singer on a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it.
And his signature.
I'll always treasure it.
I'll show you the photographs I took next time you come to visit me, OK? Till then, take care of yourself.
I have just received the letter with the result of your competition.
I feel really enthusiastic about spending a couple of weeks at Camp California.
Unfortunately, as I will be on in August, I hope this can occur in July.
Finally, I would like to know where the camp is located.
Will I have the opportunity to visit San Franscico or Los Angles? I would love it! Moreover, how much money will I need if I want to go out at night? These are some further details I keep wondering about.
I'm waiting for your answer.
First of all, I would like to lay the emphasis on the fact that this report can be seen by the Headmaster.
Therefore it must be objective.
Then it may improve our daily life at school.
It would be interesting to film a math lesson.
As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks in the final examination.
Then I would like to film the computer rooms.
Sometimes there are so many people that you have to wait half an hour to get a computer.
If only we could get some new ones.
, it would be nice to film a sequence with lots of sports activities.
It would bring some rhythm to the video.
Moreover it will show off how healthy the students are.
These are some ideas we could discuss .
By the way, I would like to travel in July, because I just have free time in July.
Moreover, I am keen on summer.
As can be seen from your letter, I can choose Accommodation.
I would prefer to stay in tents.
One reason why I choose tents is that I can feel nature more than if I stay in log cabins.
According to your letter, there are 10 main activities which I can choose 2 and play while I am on the holiday.
I would like to play Basketball and Golf.
but recently I have been interested in them.
Finally, I would like to ask some questions such as about clothes and money.
What kind of clothes are ? Furthermore, this is the first time I have been abroad, therefore I don't know how much money I should bring.
How have you been doing recently? I have been busy anyway.
I want to tell you how much I enjoyed helping at a pop concert.
It was at the beginning of this summer.
One of my friends suggested that we should have a part-time job, which was that.
Both of us are keen on pop music.
Although at first I didn't want to do it, because it was in summer.
It must have been hot.
However, we decided to have the job, because of good money.
My job just to prepare drinks for them.
Moreover, one of the famous stars gave me a signature.
I will never forget that time.
 in touch and send back a letter.
I'm very happy to have won the first prize in the competition.
I think it will be a very good experience for me.
I'm really excited about it.
First of all I'm going to give you some information about myself.
Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment for a company, and I'll only have two weeks off, the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July.
I'd love to come earlier, but I really can't because this job is very important to me, and I'll need it as work experience for my further studies at University.
I would also appreciate it if you would offer me accommodation in a log cabin, because of some health problems that I have, which do not allow me to sleep outside on the ground, and to be honest with you, I never liked camping.
I'd also like to choose photography and painting from the list of activities, because I've studied Art for three years, and these two are my favourite hobbies.
I'd also like to ask you how much money I'll need for these two weeks, and what kind of clothes I should take with me, because I've never been to the States, and I don't know what the weather is like in California during the summer.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
Shopping is an obsession for all of us.
We all like going out to the shops, and spending hours looking at all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us.
But shopping is not always enjoyable.
Especially if you go with women or children to the shops.
That is my worst nightmare.
I never go shopping with women, especially with my mother or my sisters.
And that's because they spend hours trying on all kinds of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they do not buy anything.
They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city.
At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except for looking at them trying on different clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's really annoying.
Also, you have to be careful when you go shopping with children.
Children always ask for something and they want to have all the toys which they see and that's not very enjoyable for the parents, because sometimes they spend more money than they had planned.
Thank you very much for informing me that I've won the prize.
To let you arrange the details of your programme, I'm going to give you my answers.
Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already registered on another summer course which starts at the end of July.
Sorry about that but I can make that trip only in July.
About accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins.
This is because I haven't used tents for ages so this time, I want to have tents for 2 weeks which will remind me of my childhood with my family.
I'm very keen on photography, especially while I'm staying in the States.
I might have lots of chances to take photos of beautiful countryside, so I'm longing to take part in that activity, photography.
Actually I've been in an amateur photographer's organization for 3 years.
And I'd like to choose swimming as the other one.
I learned swimming at the age of 8 for 5 years and I still love swimming.
At that time, I took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strokes.
Finally, could you let me know what the weather is like in July in the States? Then I can pack suitable clothes for that weather.
And please tell me how much money I am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
We've been thinking about the plot, at first, and we decided it would be the best way, the flow of time.
The lessons we have in the morning doesn't attract us very much, but this bit will show you the routine scenario of a lesson.
Spoken English lessons which are in the afternoon are quite interesting.
All the students keep talking about the theme and giving their opinions.
So we're going to organize about 10 minutes' short debate just for this video, but we haven't decided when it will be and the subject.
After the class is also a very essential part of school life, because we go to the pub which is situated near to the school quite often and we talk more about personal stories that make us closer.
The pub after the lessons will be interesting.
If you don't mind, we want to film the teachers' room as well.
Your preperation for lessons, everyday chats and so on.
If you allow us to film those things, we'll be very happy.
I have just received your letter and I'm writing back to tell you how happy it made me to win this prize and to give you the answers to your questions.
Finally, I decided to choose singing and basketball because my friends say I'm good at both.
Singing has always been a hobby and is an important part in my life.
Singing relaxes me when I am stressed before exams or competitions.
To finish off, I would like to ask you how much money is needed for my personal shopping expenses and what kind of clothes I should take.
Making a short video about everyday life is an enjoyable but difficult thing to do.
We should concentrate on students' imaginations, creativity and talents.
To do that, it is more interesting to go to art, music and drama classes.
, in these classes, students express themselves more than in other classes.
A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful.
The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other.
It is important to remember that close-ups should be taken of each subject.
I think this is the best advice I can give and hope that you understand the main idea, which is to concentrate more on students' attitudes than on lessons.
I have received your letter about the competition and I am very glad about it.
I would like to travel in July, please, because that is when I am on vacation.
That is really the only time I have, unfortunately.
I would love it if I could stay in a tent.
I'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations, such as getting lost in a forest, and I think staying in a tent will be very useful for that.
I'd also like to get in touch with nature, and that will be a great way to do that.
About the activities listed in your letter, I choose basketball and singing.
I have played basketball for six years, and I've been in competitions for five years.
I have good singing skills too.
I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade.
I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you like, in which I also play the guitar.
I would like to know how cold it is up there, so I know what kind of clothes I should bring.
I helped with setting up the sound equipment, programming the light system on the computer, and tidying up Madonna's room! I helped with the selling of the tickets, with the security, with the designing...
Her daughter, Lourdes Maria, is such a pretty little girl that I couldn't take my eyes off of her.
Her boyfriend, Guy Richie, was there too, and he's a really good person.
This is something I will never ever forget.
The show afterwards was great.
I couldn't believe that I had met that superstar who was dancing in front of a crowded soccer stadium.
Hope you enjoy the pictures.
I got one autograph for you.
I just received your letter with the good news.
I am very happy about winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go, but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June.
Regarding the accommodation, I would like to have a log cabin rather than a tent because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy.
I enjoy swimming and singing and I would like to join others in these activities.
I am an average swimmer and as a singer I am not a beginner and it would be fun to share my songs with the holiday makers.
Can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes I will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
In my opinion shopping is sometimes really boring, especially when you buy the same things at the supermarkets almost all the time, like cleaning products and the ingredients for everyday recipes.
On the other hand everything looks different if I have to get a present for someone in my family.
I start thinking about what she or he prefers and I try my best to buy something appropriate no matter how much money it costs.
In conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing.
 I would like to thank you for the first prize.
I am really surprised that I have won.
I did not expect it.
I would like to send you some further information which you need.
I can only come in July because I am working in the office and I cannot take two weeks off in any other month.
I am grateful that I have the chance to choose the accommodation.
I would rather stay in a tent if it's not a problem for you.
I would like to experience a real camp again.
I used to be a scout.
I need to relax after a year in the office, that's why I choose photography and painting which are not very active.
I am a very shy person and I would prefer to stay in a small group of people, if it's possible.
I have two questions.
I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I should take and I would like to know your opinion as to how much money I should take.
I would like to thank you once again for this great opportunity.
We would like to believe that shopping is the most wonderful part of our life.
After working all week, finally on Saturday we can go shopping.
We love spending money, but spending money is not always enjoyable.
Problems start when we cannot find any space to park our car.
When we finally do this, we cannot be comfortable because of the crowds.
Why it's always the same! The answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundred other people.
We become customers who want to do their shopping with pleasure.
I think we can achieve pleasure at home with our new goods.
I'm very pleased to hear from you, and I'm glad I've got this chance to go to the Camp California in the U.S.A.
for two weeks.
Firstly, I must say that I'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since I have started work and am entitled to have a holiday only in July.
Secondly, I'd prefer to stay in one of the log cabins, as they are more comfortable, usually have central heating and other necessary facilities.
Despite my appreciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I've chosen my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis.
As I was a champion in a swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practise my skills.
Also I like to play tennis, which is a beautiful "game" itself and good for the figure.
"Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not" - my English teacher has asked me in the class discussion about shopping.
Sincerely, I must admit that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores.
There are always too many people there.
As I'm not keen on being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops.
Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores.
Despite the fact that I like to go to nice clothes shops I usually return home with nothing in my hands, as prices are usually too high, unfortunately, and out of my price range.
Sometimes I go to the local market, but not on my own.
I ask my husband or mother to come with me, as I had a bad experience in the past, when my bag with all my money was stolen.
Another thing I dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assistants try to sell any product to the "victim" coming through the door.
Otherwise shopping is not so bad, as you get what you want in the end.
Thank you for the letter that confirmed first prize.
I am happy to receive it.
Of course I will able to go to Camp California in the U.S.A.
However, I will only be able to go to there in July 2001 because I have a job which is extremely busy work.
Our department, which is the sales department, have to make good sales results before the end of June because of the financial month.
So, if I can choose days, I would like to go to the U.S.A in July 2001.
About accommodation, I prefer to stay in log cabins because I don't like to stay in tents which are uncomfortable for me.
I am also not keen on preparing it.
 So, I am going to choose Golf and Tennis.
In Japan, I often play Golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing Golf, but California has good weather, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
I used to play tennis when I was a university student.
I am interested in playing tennis very much.
Best regards.
I have got good experience and fantastic memories.
At the same time, I have got a small amount of money, but it was not important to me.
I was so happy.
So, my temporary job was sound engineer but I was not main engineer.
I've just helped the staff.
When I was a university student, I studied sound effects, but I hadn't used effect equipment my whole life because our school doesn't have it.
I used this equipment during the concert, but .
At first, I couldn't understand this system but our staff were very kind people.
They taught me specially.
After that, I was able to understand this system, time after time.
Now, I am able to use a sound effect system.
Hello! I am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because that month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it.
So your advice about going to a camp suits me very well.
To answer our first question about where I would prefer to sleep, I prefer tents because they are closer to nature and I like sleeping in sleeping bags (=BV bags).
Now let me tell you about my sports preferences.
From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us came out from the water and we have to go back there.
Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why.
I have chosen them because I am applying to do a masters in sports in water polo.
And , but also because I like water very much.
Also I would like to have a t-shirt with your autograph.
In our school we have a system of "double lessons".
It means that every day except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a "double lesson".
I think that is more convenient than seven lessons every day and each of the lessons lasts forty-five minutes.
It is convenient, I mean "double" lessons, because you have more time to understand the material which is given out and because you have to prepare only four subjects for "tomorrow" and it is fewer then seven subjects.
As a student in the economics form I think I should tell you about one day in the timetable of our form.
For example Tuesday.
On Tuesday we have these lessons: English, Maths, Economics and Physics.
All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them, especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists.
Not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, Biology and Physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.
I am writing to you in reply to your letter, which let me know I am the winner of the first prize in your competition.
First of all, I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
Yet, I could only travel in July because I am a student and so my holidays begin in July.
In addition, I would rather sleep in a tent since I like being close to nature and, especially, singing birds.
I enjoy sports and I would like to go swimming and climbing.
I am not too bad at these sports.
To conclude, will you kindly let me know if I need some money and what sort of clothes I should bring with me.
This year, our English class has decided to make a short video about daily life at our school.
(It is a graduate engineering school where we are studying mechanics and .) That is why we have to single out which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
On the one hand, we should be interested in the lessons.
First, the research and design lessons are exciting since we are studying how cars are built.
Secondly, we should interview the teacher of heat transfer since his lessons are really breathtaking.
That seems to be quite surprising, yet this teacher manages to convey his knowledge.
On the other hand, we should be interested in the other activities such as sports, which could appeal to more students in our school.
For example, our basketball team has won a local championship.
To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to bring out the best in ourselves.
Last week I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize.
I am writing in response to it.
First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July during my school holidays, in order not to miss classes.
You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing.
I am very good at both of them.
I did a surfing course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life.
Please, when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything.
We are going to make a video about daily life at school.
The following classes are the ones I recommend filming.
ENGLISH: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
CHEMISTRY: We do a lot of experiments and the materials we use are very good.
I think that if we film this class the people that watch it will be impressed with the equipment we have got.
SPANISH: We are doing a play now.
We could film it and produce it.
Instead of uniforms we could wear costumes.
The ones who are animals could paint their faces.
I think that if we do it properly we could have a great Spanish play.
Those three classes are my choices.
I hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
First of all I would like to travel in July because I have already made an arrangement with my boss about my free days.
I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin.
I am not used to sleeping in a tent and I think it might ruin my holiday.
I hope it's possible to sleep in a log cabin but if it's not, you can also put me in a tent.
The two activities I would like to choose are photography and surfing.
I never really got any practice in photography.
Yes I have taken some holiday pictures but I would like to learn more about this.
So I am not very good at photography.
I am really looking forward to this holiday.
I hope I have told you enough.
How are you? I'm doing great after my experience helping at a pop concert.
It was fantastic.
You also would have liked it very much.
I had to help backstage.
I had to make sure that every artist went in the right dressing room and not in someone else's.
Every artist could scream at me whenever they wanted.
The thing was that I had to look after them because without me they would have been lost.
That was a good feeling for me.
I had to tell them when they had to go on stage and what kind of clothes they should wear.
I also had to give them drinks and food and help them to relax whenever they were nervous.
The thing I really liked was helping the artists and talking to them.
, they screamed at me all the time because they were nervous and excited about their concert.
Maybe next time you can come with me.
That would be a lot of fun.
They will call me next week, so I will write when I have talked to them.
.
I'M AFRAID I CAN ONLY GO IN JULY BECAUSE DURING THAT MONTH I WILL HAVE MY SCHOOL HOLIDAYS, SO THAT WILL BE FOR ME THE ONLY CHANCE OF TAKING 2 WEEKS OFF.
.
THE KIND OF ACCOMMODATION I PREFER IS A TENT BECAUSE AT SUMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING OUTSIDE UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM.
.
THERE ARE TWO ACTIVITIES I WOULD LIKE TO DO: BASKETBALL AND PAINTING.
I'M QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL.
WE USED TO HAVE TRAINING SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES A MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOL, WHICH WAS GREAT.
PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATE ME, EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SO GOOD AT IT, BUT MY FRIENDS SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO.
THE TECHNIQUE I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLOURS.
- MY PARENTS AND I, WE ARE NOT SURE HOW MUCH MONEY I NEED FOR THE TWO WEEKS, CAN YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE HELP? THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON.
HELLO MY GOOD FRIEND! I'M SO GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU AND TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE WEALTHY AND HAPPY.
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE HELPING AT THE POP CONCERT IN OUR TOWN? WELL THAT'S GREAT, BECAUSE IT WAS A TERRIFIC DAY.
FIRST WE STARTED VERY EARLY IN THE MORNING, BUILDING THE STAGE AND THE TENT WHERE THE GROUP WAS GOING TO PLAY, YOU KNOW, JUST IN CASE IT RAINED.
BUT WE WERE VERY LUCKY AND THE WEATHER WAS SUNNY AND WARM.
THEN CAME THE GUY WHO INSTALLED THE SOUND EQUIPMENT (CABLES, BOXES, WIRES, ETC) AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SEEING HIM AT WORK.
EVERYTHING HAD TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, PERFECTLY INSTALLED AND PROTECTED, TO AVOID ACCIDENTS.
AT ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK EVERYTHING WAS READY AND THE BAND CAME ON.
THERE WERE ALREADY PLENTY OF FANS WAITING FOR THE CONCERT TO BEGIN, WHICH STARTED AT 7 O'CLOCK.
I KNOW THE MUSICIANS FROM SCHOOL , WHICH IS WHY IT WAS EVEN MORE FUN TO HELP AND TO TAKE PART IN THIS EVENT, SPECIALLY BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC THEY PLAY.
THE CROWD WENT CRAZY DURING THE 2-HOUR CONCERT AND I HELPED AS WELL, SELLING CDS - IF THEY GO ON SELLING THAT MANY, THEY ARE GOING TO BE VERY FAMOUS FOR SURE .....
First of all, I can travel only in July because that is the only time when I am free from my examinations.
The two activities I would like to do in the camp are swimming and photography.
I am a good swimmer and I have some experience in photography.
However, I have a lot to learn.
In the morning prefects make sure that everybody is awake and up.
At the assembly students are told about changes in the timetable and activities for the whole day.
In the computing department students learn about information technologies.
The main job of the head of the computing department is not to teach but to keep the computers working properly.
Maths is the most popular subject in the school.
Mathematics teachers do a great deal of work and have almost no time to prepare lessons.
In the chemistry lab experiments are often set up.
The teacher looks after the pupils while they are investigating the topic of the lesson.
Meals are very important.
The kitchen staff works hard to provide students with a variety of food.
The video can finish with a view of the school from outside.
As regards the time that I can travel, I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July.
I hope that it won't be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July.
I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergy to grass.
 you asked me to choose two activities from the list you sent to me.
I would like to do surfing and photography.
I am a total beginner in both activities, but I think that these two weeks will be a good opportunity to learn something about them.
Finally, I also have some questions for you.
Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any facilities for cooking.
If you have to go shopping again, because the fridge is empty or you need some new clothes, a lot of time, patience and strength are needed.
All kinds of shopping have more and more become a stressful activity rather than an enjoyable on.
It often begins with finding a parking space for the car, which can take more than 15 minutes.
Leaving the car at home is also not a good idea as you often buy so much that you can't carry it in plastic bags.
The next stressful factor begins in the shop.
Everywhere people who are in a hurry push you from one side to the other.
Consuming has become a very important thing for them.
And if you are not quick enough they won't leave you anything .
But problems also occur if there are products left: either you can't decide between two things or your favourite product is too expensive.
Having finally decided and got what you wanted , the next torture comes at the cash desk, when you have to pay.
You have to wait in a long queue for more than 15 minutes.
So even if it's nice to have food or new clothes at home, without patience, time and strength you had better stay at home or try to find the most convenient time for shopping.
I was grateful to hear I have won first prize in the competition.
I would like to join the camp in July because I can get a holiday from my company from 1th July to 28th July.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in tents.
I've never tried to stay in tents during the holiday.
That's why I'd like to feel adventurous.
It could be a good, memorable thing for me.
And I am interested in swimming and singing.
When I was 17 years old, I won a swimming competition which was held in a local stadium.
I won second prize.
And also, I have joined a band in my school.
I'm responsible for lead vocals.
Every Monday we have a practice time.
What I would like to know about is what kinds of clothes suit the season in the U.S.A and how much money I should bring to the camp.
I look forward to joining the camp.
I've always wanted to go to the U.S.A.
It must be a good chance to join the camp.
Thanks for accepting.
Subject.
Some suggestions to make a video about daily life at our school.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why they are suitable to make a film of.
The point of "upper intermediate class".
They are having a special time.
Every Friday, they enjoy a special game to check vocabulary.
And they always do their homework best.
I'm pleased to win the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
As I'm an art student at a particular College, I can only go to Camp California in July, because in that month I haven't got any classes, and I'm free to do whatever I want to.
I'd like a log cabin for my accommodation, because it's safer and cleaner than a tent and I wouldn't share it with anyone.
Painting and Photography are good activities for me.
They suit me because my art work develops in these areas.
Through Painting I talk about human beings in this world, on big canvases; and through Photography, in Collages, I talk about anger and guilt in the family line.
So at Camp California I would like to keep in touch with these areas.
I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge.
With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records.
To summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks so I do not forget my artistic life.
.
We can analyze when shopping is enjoyable, and when it is not.
There is joy in shopping when it is done by ourselves for ourselves.
That means buying whatever we like, like clothes, records, rings, and books.
What we like is based on our relationships with other people, at work or in the family.
So we have fun when we buy what we like according to other people's views.
On the other hand, sickness in ourselves or our relatives makes us reluctant to shop.
It is an obligation to shop for medicines, clothes for winter, doctor's visits, and so forth.
A death in the family is also not an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is .
Buying coffins and graveyard plots to bury relatives is not as enjoyable as buying clothes.
In summary shopping can be enjoyable or not depending on our state of health.
To give examples: if we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves; if we are sick, or our relatives are, we buy medicines and we do not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation.
You ask me when I would like to travel? I can travel only in July because I only have a holiday from my work in this month.
So it would be very nice if that's possible.
Then the activities that I would like to do are singing and swimming.
I like singing because it's my favourite hobby and I grew up with it and swimming because I like water and the feeling that you have when you are in it.
Another reason for choosing swimming is that I'm good at it because a few years ago I had lessons, where I learned to swim very well.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
Everybody likes shopping! Looking for clothes and shoes is for every woman one of her favourite hobbies and if it were possible she would stay in the shopping-centre the whole day.
Sometimes it's really awful when you have to wait a very long time until it's your turn to pay or to try some clothes on.
To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of thinking I did well, I had to play against very strong competition.
The idea of going to California for 2 weeks makes me feel very excited.
Referring to your letter, July is the time that suits me best.
My job is less demanding in July.
About the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a tent.
I have never done it before, so I really fancy the idea.
I am really surprised about how many activities can be done in this place.
If it is possible I would like to swim.
I am very good at swimming.
On the one hand I think that climbing sounds very exciting, but on the other hand it scares me a lot, so I will play tennis.
I am not so bad at tennis but I would like to improve my style.
Another point is about clothes.
Could you confirm that I'll need summer clothes? I would be very pleased .
Please, if you need further information from me, don't hesitate to contact me again.
Normally I really enjoy shopping.
In fact when I don't feel very happy I decide to go shopping to try to cheer myself up.
And really, it works.
But not everything about shopping is enjoyable.
For example, I hate it when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded.
I don't like it when I have to try on different sizes because the small size doesn't fit me because I have put on weight.
It is at this moment when really I realise I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling.
I think women, in general, are very impulsive when purchasing things.
Many times we buy things that, actually, we don't need and, sometimes you are surprised when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down on your expenses for 2 months.
But from another point of view, it is silly to be earning money and not spending it as you want.
At the end of the day money is just money.
Thanks for accepting me in the competition.
I hear that the competition there is very intense, and that Camp California is very famous for its competitions.
I would like to travel in July because before then it's impossible for me and it's my birthday in July and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full.
Another thing is my accommodation.
I prefer to have log cabins because it's easiest for me.
I will choose for my activities tennis and swimming.
I'm good at tennis because I have played since 1990 and I love it and I chose swimming because I like to swim and I've been in two competitions and I won both.
I would like to ask you for money and clothes because my parents are travelling and it is impossible for me to get any money because my sister doesn't want me to go because I'm only 14, but when I get there I promise to return to you all the money because I don't have any cash at the moment.
Thanks for everything, and I will be there next month.
For me going shopping is not the best thing I can do.
Well I thought the opposite about a year ago but recently I have thought this because I see all the people going shopping and they don't realise that outside in the real world there are poor people who need that money which they are only spending on material things.
You might put your money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know.
I like to shop sometimes but not always and I don't like spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need.
As to the rest of you who don't understand this, it's on your mind to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.
Bye and think about this.
With reference to the letter from you, I would like to inform you of some further information, as follows.
Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining .
Some people will go shopping when they are sad to forget everything and the fact is that everybody knows how to shop.
If you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying .
However, they are happy once they have it.
Anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new , suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
I like shopping too and I believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to survive.
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me I won first prize in your competition, which is two weeks .
I was very happy with this result since I did not think I could win.
First of all I would like to tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because in the other months I will be too busy with my work.
In the second place I add that I would prefer to stay in a tent, even though it is not very comfortable, because I want to put myself to the test by living in conditions I am not used to.
Besides this, in connection with the activities we will have the chance to do, I would like to inform you that I choose swimming and tennis because I am quite good at both, especially at tennis.
In addition to this I would like to ask you what kind of clothes and how much money is necessary to have, since I am undecided about it, not knowing the cost of living in California.
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school should be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do, not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.
Most of the students agree in saying that there are two main features in our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to concentrate on us working and speaking together, without the help of the teacher, and also to film some amusing moments we spend waiting for the teacher.
A small percentage, on the contrary, said it would be very useful to film the teacher when she is something important to us, to give an idea of real life in our classroom.
.
I am writing in response to your letter which I received two days go and in order to answer all questions I was asked .
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in a tent.
I am used to this kind of accommodation since I have been taking part in survival camps for a long time.
As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing.
The reason for my decision is that other activities are also available in my country, except climbing, but I have a fear of heights so this one is not destined for people like me.
I think I told you about my plans to join a group that helps at concerts, didn't I? Well, I took my chance and I was chosen to help at Michael Jackson's concert.
Amazing, isn't it? The event took place a month ago in the Rock Stadium.
There were about 100 000 people.
We had a lot of things to do.
Actually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
Many people fainted and some of them, the most serious cases, had to be taken to hospital.
The biggest problem was connected with some foreigners who couldn't speak Polish or English and we didn't know how to help them.
Despite this fact, the atmosphere was terrific.
I didn't manage to meet Michael as I had expected, but apart from that, I really enjoyed the time I spent there.
You should also try it.
I am very happy to have won the first prize in the competition, and I am going to clarify some details you asked me about in your letter.
Firstly, because of my school exam, I would like to travel only in July.
Moreover, I have chosen this month because I think the weather will be fine.
At Camp California, I hope I will be in a tent because I like very much this kind of lifestyle: I love to be in contact with nature.
As you asked me in your last letter, I am going to tell you more about last month's pop concert.
Firstly, I arrived five hours before the beginning of the concert in order to help the musicians to move the equipment from the van to the stage.
As soon as all the conections were made, we tested the volume: I found it too loud, so I advised them to lower it, and they listened to me! Then, there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
So, it was a fantastic afternoon because I like music very much, even if I don't play any musical instrument.
Moreover, I learnt a lot about music, especially concerning how to play an instrument.
Consequently, I hope I will play an instrument in the future, especially because the group promises to help me to learn any instrument.
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY IRREGULAR WORK.
JULY IS THE LOW SEASON AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO GO ON HOLIDAY THEN.
FURTHER I WOULD PREFER A TENT.
I WAS AT A SPORTS CAMP LAST YEAR AND IT WAS FUN TO SLEEP IN TENTS.
FROM THE ACTIVITIES I CHOOSE TENNIS AND SURFING.
I HAVE PLAYED TENNIS IN A CHAMPIONSHIP FOR FIVE YEARS BUT SURFING I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE.
AS YOU KNOW I WROTE TO THAT ORGANISATION WHICH IS ALWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR BIG EVENTS.
ONE WEEK LATER THEY INVITED ME TO A POP CONCERT WHICH TOOK PLACE IN ZURICH LAST MONTH.
WHEN I ARRIVED WE FIRST HAD A MEETING.
ALL OF THE STAFF AND THE ORGANISATION SPOKE ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE.
AFTER THE MEETING WE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME CLOTHES.
WE WERE A GROUP! ONE TEAM! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.
IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT HOBBIES AND JOBS.
I am writing to you because I would like to provide the information that you ask for.
Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free from my job.
It will be impossible at another time, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think it is the best month to travel; the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons.
Secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents.
I think it could be more interesting.
I could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside.
In my opinion if I choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.
About the two activities I need to select, I think the best ones are swimming and painting.
I choose swimming because I really love doing it.
I used to swim every day in the sea a few years ago.
I felt really healthy.
My other choice is painting.
I have been painting since I was ten years old.
I used to go to special classes and I don't mind if you need me to help in the class.
One thing I would like to ask is if I need special clothes.
I don't know what kind of camp I am going to.
It should be a dry place, I think, but I would like to make sure .
Also, I would like to know how much money I will need, because I don't know if there will be any gift shops.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression.
You can enjoy your time spending all the money you have, buying clothes, jewellery, furniture, etc.
and you could have a really great time.
But other people don't think like this.
For example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
The mother was shocked.
She didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out .
It was a nightmare but fortunately the police found her.
In my opinion shopping is not a thing that I would like to do in my free time.
I think that it's too stressful, there are too many people in the shops, so I prefer to spend my free time swimming or painting and I go shopping on the days when usually there are not too many people.
Thank you very much for your nice letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition.
I'm really surprised and happy about it.
In your letter you asked for some information about me.
Unfortunately, I can only travel in July because in August I will start a new job for six months.
.
Regarding accommodation at this camp, I would prefer staying in a tent to staying in a log cabin.
It is more fun and more sociable.
It will allow me to make friends more quickly.
Two of my favourite activities are swimming and photography.
The first one of these .
I go swimming every day and swim one mile.
Last summer I won a prize in a swimming competition.
The second activity is more of a hobby.
I like to go to the countryside and take photographs.
I started two months ago.
I don't have any equipment.
I'm so happy about the experience I had last month.
I told you that I helped at a pop concert last month.
It was really great.
First I was chosen to sell the tickets.
I was really happy to help at a concert as big as Mylene Farmer's.
I was starting to sell the tickets when an organiser told me to go into the dressing room.
They needed one person to put the clothes into a wardrobe.
It was the dressing room of Mylene Farmer.
What do you think of that? I was so excited! Unfortunately, I didn't see her but it allowed me to talk with her manager, John, and her musicians.
They were all very kind and pleasant.
It was a big moment for me.
These people are like us, they just have a special job with .
Next year, if it is possible, I would like go back with you.
They will organise the same pop concert but with another singer.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
I am very happy to hear from you that I have won first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
and I am writing to tell you my information.
Firstly, I will be able to travel only in July because I go to university and I normally spend most of the time working.
and I have holiday only in July.
Secondly,  accommodation.
I prefer tents.
When I go camping, I stay in log cabins all the time so I would like to try a different way to camp, this time.
And I choose photography and tennis from the activities list.
I am taking photography lessons at university and I started tennis when I was 10 so I am good at both of them.
Finally, I have questions about clothes and money.
The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help.
It was really more interesting than I expected.
My job behind the stage was helping with make-up, hair and clothes .
It was very hard.
The singers often changed their clothes and their make-up was because of the sweat.
It was different from when I did it at college.
There was no time to rest.
But I met a lot of famous singers and spoke to them.
So many people were in front of the stage and they couldn't see them very well, but I was very near to the stage and I could see them just there.
Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't seen each other for so long time and I'll tell you more stories about this.
Firstly, I am very happy to win this first prize and as expected I'm following your instructions.
I can enjoy this prize only after the 7th of July, because before this date I will be in Jamaica doing an English course.
I have been travelling around Jamaica for a year without any due to an inclination for adventure, so I would rather you provided a tent, I don't mind.
From the 10 options that I have to choose from I will choose two, climbing, which I have been doing for three years because I know it by heart, and swimming which I have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
I would like to know about what sort of clothes I have got to take? And I also would like to ask how much money I have got to take.
I hope that coming after July won't disturb Camp California's plans for me.
, everybody has to spend all their childhood and youth at school, because of that everybody has a similar daily life such as, wake up, got to the school, study and the best, meet all the friends.
A survey has been done, and the issue is which subjects (lessons) and activities the students think are the most enjoyable.
Someone says it is maths - practical, useful - but the majority say it is boring, unless you're choosing a job which demands all your maths knowledge such as accounting, otherwise you can use a calculator or a computer.
The majority have chosen History, which means a big journey around the world, .
People must get some rest often, and as a result they look forward to some happiness free time .
That should be filmed.
At all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed.
This is an important part of our life, which is full of .
I am writing this letter to let you know my decision in reply to your letter, which I have received recently.
I would like to thank you for the competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition.
I think I could have a holiday only in July because I will have been working for my company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one-month holiday from my company.
I would prefer to stay in a tent than stay in the log cabin because a tent is more enjoyable.
I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailing because I have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and I have had a really good training in water sports.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I hope you and all your family are well and everything is OK.
I'd like to tell you about the exciting experience I had last month during a pop concert.
I wish you had been there and seen the concert, it was really brilliant.
As you know, I'd never been to any activities as a volunteer before.
The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an advertisement on TV.
It said, "Be a volunteer at our concert and get a free ticket." After that I applied and they accepted my application.
You should have seen it, there was a really terrible rush before the concert and everybody was running around doing something.
I helped to carry huge speakers to the concert venue.
Then I was told to stay in front of the entrance and check the tickets.
Some people tried to enter without a ticket but they weren't allowed by the police.
Finally, I helped them and in return I had a good experience as well as enjoying listening to the music.
I've just received your letter, and I must say that I am so surprised.
I wasn't expecting to win it.
I am still studying at the moment I will finish at the end of June so I will be able to leave at the beginning of July.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent so as to get a better rest.
I have a problem sleeping and a log cabin will be more peaceful than a tent.
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities.
It's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choice, I choose climbing and surfing.
I'm rather experienced at climbing.
I have done it once a month since I was 17.
But on the other hand, I have never been surfing.
I am a complete beginner but I am dying to do it.
I've got just one question to ask.
I know it is all inclusive, but is there anything I will have to pay for? If there is, please let me know.
After that, we should have a morning shot of one of the busiest London tube stations in order to show stressed people going in and out, among them our protagonist leaving peacefully with a couple of books in his hand - then the school's door, and him going in.
After this introduction, it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school, .
And finally a shot of all the students leaving the school would be a nice ending.
The aim of this report is to describe and assess daily life at this school and suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
This is based on a questionnaire conducted in the school and our English department's investigation.
According to statistics based on the questionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class.
This may be thanks to native-speaker teachers who came to the school last year.
In fact, I visited some English classes to find out that most students tried to answer questions and speak to native teachers.
Furthermore, fewer students were nodding off compared with other classes like Maths.
Consequently, it might be a good idea to film the English class so that the vibrant and active atmosphere may be able to be filmed.
This may also contribute to the promotion of the English department.
It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students.
As the record says, our hockey team has been at the top of the league for three successive years.
The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keenness on practice.
Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team.
Team members can be interviewed.
To sum up, our school is famous for achievements in several fields as well as academic achievements.
The whole point of making a video is to tell people that we are not only bookworms but also enjoying our school life.
It might also be a good idea to film our computing rooms and sports facilities that we can be proud of.
I would like to reach the camp in July, and spend there the last two weeks of the month because in August I must start studying for my examinations.
As to accommodation I would like to choose a tent because I am used to travelling with my sleeping bag and my tent all over Europe.
As far as activities are concerned I would prefer basketball and climbing.
I am very good at basketball, and even if I am not a tall boy, I am a good player and I play in a local team.
As to climbing I am quite inexperienced but I would like to improve.
I was very happy to receive your last letter.
As you know I had a great time helping at a pop concert.
I was at the concert when I met a friend of mine whose job is to organise shows like that.
He told me he needed a boy who could help on stage.
As you know, I can do a little of everything so I accepted.
I connected wires, I carried loudspeakers, and so on.
When the show started I was on the stage close to two famous singers, Bono Vox and David Bowie.
Towards the end of the concert I handed a bottle of wine to Poolo Conte.
I couldn't believe it! Poolo Conte asked me to drink with Him.
As you know he's my favourite singer.
We started talking about music and I asked him many things about his lyrics, which are beautiful but sometimes difficult to understand.
I don't think I will ever forget that evening.
I am writing to reply to your letter about the first prize in your competition and to give you all the information for my two weeks at Camp California.
First of all, I would prefer travelling in July, because I will be on vacation and I'm not allowed to travel during term.
It'd be great if I could stay in a tent, because I've never slept in a tent before, and I think it is an interesting experience.
Finally, I want to thank you for this great opportunity.
I look forward to hearing from you.
A is not often good.
Shopping is said to be an enjoyable in all situations.
However sometimes it isn't so wonderful as it seems to be.
When you go to a shop it is difficult to find what you are looking for without the help of the shop assistant.
The problem is finding a shop assistant who listens to your problems and can help you.
After that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash.
So you have wasted hours buying nothing.
You can't talk to the manager even to give him suggestions on how to improve his business, because he is always absent.
And don't try to complain to someone else because they won't hear you.
Even if I worked hard on it, I was very surprised to win the first prize.
At the moment, I'm worried about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently got a new job and I started working just three months ago.
For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to choose the time of my holidays.
Consequently I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work for suspends its activities.
As far as I am concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tent as well.
As you already know, I am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently I would choose photography as the first activity and painting as the second.
However, I would like to know if by any chance the photography activities are only for beginners.
In this case I would rather do some climbing, which I have never done before.
In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity.
Actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
In fact, the shopping you do for your daily needs is seldom enjoyable, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and moreover you are often faced with some nasty situations.
Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job.
Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need to, shopping can be a very nice activity.
Personally I don't like dealing with shop assistants and looking around the shops, so I buy all that I can using "on-line" services.
First of all, I would like to thank you and your organisation for giving me this opportunity.
I've just received your letter this morning.
I am very happy and excited about it.
I am really looking forward to taking part in Camp California.
How are you? I am fine.
Remember I told you that I had been selected to help at a pop concert of a local band? Well, it turned out really well and everybody had a great time.
It was last month that I was selected.
I had to help the director write a script for the concert and design the background of the stage.
I had also been told that they were going to make a music video of that concert, so I tried as well as I could.
I didn't get involved that much in writing the script because it was very hard and the director wrote most of it but the main idea for the background of the stage was mine, and I am very proud of it.
Everything was finally two days before the concert.
On Saturday night, the concert began.
Everything went really well.
The music was great and the fans were loving it.
When they finished singing the last song I was surprised when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
I am sure that I'll never forget that moment.
I am writing to thank you for the first prize in your competition and to reply to your letter.
First of all, in your letter you asked me my preferred travel dates.
If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to be on holiday in July.
In your letter, at Camp California.
I would like to be in tents because I find being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins.
I am very happy because I can have a chance to do activities while I am at the camp.
I would like to take part in the Golf and the sailing.
I am not good at either of them.
I have been interested in them so I would like to .
Finally, I would like to know something about travel.
Could you let me know whether I need extra money or what sort of clothes I need.
I would also like to know whether someone will be at the airport for me because this will be my first time in the U.S.A.
I was happy to get your letter.
I haven't written a letter to you for ages.
I'm sorry about that.
In your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert.
I'll tell you about my experience helping at the pop concert.
At first, I applied to be a volunteer at the pop concert and then I got responsibility for controlling the audience.
I had to make the fans keep in a queue.
I also helped them find their seats.
It was very hard work.
For example, I always spoke loudly and ran fast.
However, there was something good for me.
I saw a lot of singers and entertainers.
I didn't need to pay an entrance fee because I was working there.
I'll tell you more about the experience in my next letter.
In response to your letter that I received last Saturday I am writing to answer your questions.
I am very happy that I won this competition.
I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday.
My holidays will finish at the beginning of September and it will be good to travel during this period.
(August-September).
The accommodation I would prefer to stay in is a tent because I like adventures and also I will have more contact with nature.
For the time that I will spend there I would like to choose more than two activities but I know it is not possible so I choose swimming and singing.
I usually sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city.
So, I am quite good.
This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed from our daily life at school.
Firstly we should film our school to show how important it is for our development.
Secondly, parts of our life, like breaks, lunch time, spending time with friends, will be good to make the video interesting.
A good to film is our Geography class.
The students in this class have lots of freedom to speak and we can travel around the world in one hour and fifteen minutes.
It is wonderful how technology makes things so easy.
Also we should film our sports class because with this we will show how important it is to be healthy nowadays.
To conclude we could film our teachers' lives too.
That will be great because teachers are part of our life and they have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it wasn't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidently and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.
Firstly, I would like to start my trip in the second week of July because I will have a 3-week holiday in July.
I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months.
As for the accommodation, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I hate sleeping in tents.
I stayed in a tent once when I had my Duke of Edinburgh walk.
I felt really uncomfortable in the tent.
Secondly, I would like to have a chance to do singing and swimming while I am at the Camp.
I am keen on singing and I have won several singing competitions at school.
I have chosen swimming because it is my favourite sport.
I enjoy doing it very much.
I note that all accommodation and travel costs are paid , but does it include my expenses in California? Lastly, I would like to know what the weather in California is like and what type of clothes I have to bring.
Would it be possible for you to send me a map of California so I know where the campsite is situated? I would be grateful if you could send me some information.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Hi! How are you? How are you getting on with your school work? Do you enjoy your school life? As you know, I had a wonderful experience last month so I am writing to tell you about it.
I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance last month.
At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do.
However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen.
When I first entered the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here.
There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help.
We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other.
I found that they were all Kelly's fans.
We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall.
There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations in the right place.
It was tiring work because I had to run from place to place to hang the decorations.
After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall.
She smiled at me and said thank you to me.
I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had.
At last, the concert started.
There were many people at the show and I was sitting in a good seat to watch the concert.
Regarding your letter dated the 6th of June I'm so happy to receive the first prize.
Thanks very much.
I would like to travel in July to California.
The reason is that we have long holidays at school at that time.
Although the accommodation isn't so important for me, I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed.
I have chosen as my activities surfing and photography.
I'm a beginner at both activities.
Most of the time shopping is fun and enjoyable.
There are a lot of reasons why it can be awful to go shopping.
if you run out of money or you have to buy a particular thing which is difficult to find.
I once had this problem.
I was looking for a special fruit.
The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice or helpful.
Sometimes they give me a bad feeling like .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother.
Awful! He wanted everything that his eyes saw.
All the stuff for children is on the same level as their eyes.
Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store.
When I feel in the mood for shopping everything is closed or I haven't enough time to look around.
My conclusion on these points is not so bad.
I like shopping only with my best friend.
Thank you for that information.
I didn't expect that I could win your competition.
I want to travel only in July because now I'm studying at National Academy of Defense and I don't have time for anything else.
When I arrive, I would prefer accommodation in Log cabins.
I prefer that because I will travel with my wife and she always prefers that kind of accommodation.
I tell you in secret that I don't know why she does that.
You said that I will have the chance to do two activities, so I choose swimming and sailing.
I Love all kinds of water sports.
In summer I always go to the seaside or some kind of lake to swim.
I like to catch fish too.
I think that I'm good at swimming.
When I was young I swam in many competitions.
My personal best is 27.66 for fifty meters.
I would like to ask you about the weather in California in July.
What kind of clothes should I bring with me? Are there any discotheques or something? I would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her I can't be there.
I'm studying at National Academy of Defense.
There are about two thousand students at my school.
There are only men.
Everybody gets up at six, and the first thing they do is run for about two thousand five hundred metres.
Then they take a shower and everybody goes for breakfast.
Usually I have eight lessons.
Two times a week I have W-F.
This is very important, because every soldier should be strong.
Today there was the sport competition in Basketball.
My group of students won that competition for the second time.
I don't play basketball well, but my friends do.
After this competition there was mathematics, and two hours of biology.
I don't like biology, so I slept on the desk in a classroom.
I think that competitions should be filmed because my school is a kind of sports school.
On video there should be how we get up, how we run, how we eat breakfast.
Then you should show how our school looks from outside.
There should be an interview with students and with professors.
Daily life at my school is not only school and teachers and mathematics problems.
There are military problems too.
We spend a lot of time outside the school during the military things.
We must know how to use a gun, or how to drive a tank.
That kind of thing should be filmed somehow.
The only time available for me to travel is July.
Any time during the month suits me.
I need to insist on it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year.
I would love to stay in a log cabin.
They are more comfortable and the environment.
It is not easy to choose from the list of activities.
All of them look interesting.
Although this is a new experience, I would prefer climbing and photography.
The first one sounds like a great adventure, while the second will allow me to capture all the unforgettable views.
In addition, I would appreciate it if you let me know what is the kind of clothing required for the Camp; whether I need some money there and for what; and finally whether the prize is just for me or if I can go with somebody else.
During the day I helped prepare her room, then she arrived, and I was there to continue helping.
She was so kind to all of us.
Of course I asked her for an autograph.
I hope to see you soon.
I can't wait to show it to you.
The concert was a big success, a lot of excitement.
Everybody sang and danced, and I was there to see everything from the best position.
Each time she came back to the room, she asked for something to drink, just a diet coke, because she's always looking after her figure.
Then she ate something small and she looked full of energy all night long.
At the end, she took the time to say goodbye to all of the people helping her.
I really think she's the best.
First of all, I would prefer to travel during the month of July, because I have already booked a holiday with my cousins in August.
The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed.
In order to prepare this report I visited the classrooms on many occasions and talked to the students and teachers.
It seems to me that it would be a nice idea to show our library because, according to the librarians, the library has a welcoming atmosphere and is also well usedMoreover, the range of books and newspapers is very broad and useful.
The students mentioned that it would be very interesting to show the English lesson because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to find out about our English course.
To sum up, I would suggest filming our library, because it is a pleasant place that students really like, and the English lesson, which will help foreign students in their future decisions.
I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize in the competition, about which I need more information.
To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel.
Well, I would only be available in July, because at that time I would be on my winter holidays.
Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent to sleeping in a log cabin because it is easier to clean.
You mentioned the chance to choose two activities from your list.
I would like to do tennis, because I used to play when I was at school, and swimming because I like water sports and because I am good at it.
Could you also let me know what kind of clothes and how much money I would have to take.
Thanking you in advance for your help, I look forward to hearing from you.
Subject: Suggest lessons and activities to be filmed.
It is a very interesting lesson where you can learn about the things that happened in your country.
Also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visits to historical places.
In this lesson you can learn how to speak, write and read this foreign language with teachers that are well prepared.
There is a well-equipped gym where students of all ages can practise any kind of sport in their free time.
This is an extra-curricular activity where you can take part in a play.
You can sing, act or just help backstage.
To sum up, it is a big school where you have a lot of interesting lessons and some optional activities to do in your free time.
I've just received your letter and I thank you very much indeed for that.
I didn't expect to win the first prize in your competition.
I am very happy.
It has always been my dream to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Now it's become a reality.
If I can choose the time, I would like to travel only in July because in other months I have a lot of things to do.
Regarding accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is safer than a tent.
I've read that I will have a chance to do two extra activities while I am at Camp.
I think it would be a good idea to practise my photographic technique, because I'm not so good a photographer and I would like to learn how to swim as I can't do it.
Taking part in these two activities would be very useful for me.
A few days ago my class had a big discussion about shopping.
On that occasion I hadn't the opportunity to give my opinion on this task.
Now, my English teacher has asked me to explain what I think.
In my opinion, nowadays, shopping is very easy and at the same time very hard.
It is very easy because there are a lot of things to buy, shops are full of every kind of thing.
You can choose the price most suitable for you.
Choosing from a lot of things and choosing the prices too are very enjoyable for me.
I remember very well two people who thought very differently about shopping.
My grandmother thought that shopping was a terrible thing.
She hadn't even enough money to buy the bread.
Whereas, my mother was very keen on shopping for everything.
I am writing to you in order to get further information about my trip to Camp California and to make some things a bit clearer for you.
Firstly, since I'll be very busy during the next three months due to my job's demands, I would like to travel in July.
Although the weather may not be , it is the only time I have to see the beauty of the camp.
I would also like to know some more details about what sort of clothes I will have to bring with me and about the amount of money which it will be necessary for me to take.
I'm looking forward to joining you in July and hoping that this trip is an amazing experience.
As a child, I would be taken to the mall and be forced to go through all the shops and establishments just to please my mother, whose desire to buy, without any sort of control, all kinds of clothes and gadgets was something unbelievable.
And due to these bizarre experiences I went through as a little boy, everything related to shopping seems like a bitter liquid which I'm forced to drink.
Believe me, shopping can also be painful.
Your feet will turn into pancakes after a long day out in the streets and your muscles can get seriously injured after carrying all those bags which contain loads of objects.
Amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
Nonetheless, people still find some obscure pleasure in putting their mental health at risk.
They keep claiming that there's nothing better than shopping.
In spite of our decadence, some cheap souls still have the courage to say that, by shopping, they're filling their empty spaces.
Firstly, I can only travel in July because that's when I have vacations from school.
Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent.
I have stayed in a tent a few times and I have not had any problems.
About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to play Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some exercise while I am on vacation.
I also chose photography because it is one of my hobbies.
I am very good at both activities because I have done them all my life.
Those are all my questions.
I am looking forward to receiving your reply.
Please write to me soon.
As you know, I am a member of a BSB fan club, and last month we had the opportunity to help at a concert they gave in the city where I live.
First, I helped sell the tickets.
That wasn't difficult because everybody wanted to go.
The day of the concert we helped to clean the place where the concert was performed and to get everything in order so the concert could be a success, which it was.
I would like to go in July because it's the only month I can choose.
In July I'll be on my vacation.
As for accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents.
In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it.
I'd be glad to choose painting and singing.
And I'm good at both because I used to go to a painting studio when I was at school.
I also used to be in the school choir and was one of the best sopranos.
So I'd be happy to do the activities for two reasons.
First I am good enough at both of them.
Secondly I truly love painting and singing.
I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to know what clothes I should take.
Another thing I am interested in is general information on prices in the USA.
I would greatly appreciate your prompt answer.
I've just received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in your competition : 2 weeks at Camp California in the USA.
I am very glad to hear that and would like to tell you all the information you need to know from me.
I will be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be enough time to fit the trip in.
Also I cannot go during other holidays because for the Easter holiday I need to take part in a Tennis competition my school and we need time to practise.
In the Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family.
Also we are going on a with my relatives.
Those are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other time.
I do apologize about that.
I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing.
As I said before, I have to take part in a tennis competition, so I think I am quite good at it.
I started playing tennis when I was 9.
Now I am 18 years old.
I was in the tennis county when I was 12.
I have taken part in 15 competitions already.
I have lost 5 games and won 10 games.
My dad encourages me to play tennis and I enjoy it.
Regarding climbing, I started to be interested in it when I was 14.
My family live near the sea so we get quite a lot of chances to go climbing.
I'm not scared of heights and I think it's challenging.
My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.
I would like to ask you a few questions.
How hot is it in California in July? I know what kind of clothes I need.
Do I need a lot of money? Will we have time for shopping? What kind of food do we eat? This is because I cannot eat Pork.
If this is an inconvenience, please feel free to tell me.
Thank you very much.
The preparation days came.
The first day we started to work for this concert, the real professionals came.
Their job was to prepare for the concert.
I had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amazing! It sounded very interesting to me.
Then we started to talk about what we had to do for this concert.
I have learnt lots of things about preparing a stage, lights, sound and background.
I felt like I was one of those professionals too because they always called me and my friend to help them and that made me learn lots of things from doing the practical work.
All of them were very nice and friendly.
Another exciting part was I had to climb to put the lights up.
Can you imagine the real concert, and how high the lights always are? It was good fun though! But my friend didn't like doing that at all.
She didn't seem to enjoy it as much as I did.
, my ambition is to be like one of those professionals.
I really do hope I can be like them.
My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on.
Do you know, my ambition makes me try to work very hard and this term I got A for my art and design.
It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it if I keep on working hard.
I think the concert has changed me so much.
Now I have my aim for what I should do in my life.
I feel like I have to work harder.
I hope you will feel like me one day.
I will write to you again soon and tell you how I am getting on.
Thank you very much for your letter which I have received this morning.
Firstly, I would like to go to Camp California in the U.S.A in July because I still have got an examination in my college until June, 20th.
So if it's possible could you arrange it for me please.
And also, I would prefer the log cabins to the tents, as I have never slept in a sleeping bag before.
I imagine I couldn't sleep at all.
Secondly, I would like to play basketball and tennis at the Camp.
They are my two choices of activities, because I used to play tennis and basketball for ages.
Finally, could you give me your suggestion about money and clothes.
What kinds of clothes are suitable to take with me and .
Could you please send me more information about this.
Hi! How are you? Thank you for your kind letter and I am glad to hear about your news.
Kim, I would like to tell you my wonderful experience last month! On 5th of May, which was a national holiday in Japan, I had a part-time job at a pop concert in the Tokyo Dome.
The pop singer was called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan.
The concert started at 7.00 p.m.
At that time I was on the second floor where I had to work .
I stood up in front of the audience and .
I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs.
I thought if you were here I could really enjoy it with you.
Some of the fans were not good at all because they shouted and argued, but most of the people were very good.
I had enjoyed my wonderful experience so much.
I must say though, I would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.
A log cabin would be the ideal accommodation.
Presumably they are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy.
It's always nice to have a warm, clean place to go to after sailing, which is one of the activities I would like to do.
And I'm quite good at it.
Climbing would be my second option, but for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction because I've only done it a few times.
I would like to know how much money people usually take and how much clothing.
Well, you want to know what I did at the concert? Help..
I know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
About 20 people were helping apart from me.
We had a kind of rotation system so that all the volunteers could also enjoy some of the concert.
First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year it is very hot and I prefer going in summer to going in winter or during it other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter it would be impossible to do.
Secondly, I would rather stay in a log cabin than stay in a tent.
In my opinion staying in log cabins is more fun and much cleaner.
Thirdly, I would prefer to swim and play tennis, because I have been doing this since I was I child, and I think I am very good at each activity.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or if everything is provided by the organisers.
Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take.
Sorry for not writing to you before, but I have been so busy, because last week I went to a pop concert to help the singers.
First, when I arrived they told me to go to a big room, where the singers try on their clothes and they have their make-up put on.
There, in the room I had to help them, I the singers, to put on their clothes, and I had to put make-up on them.
A few minutes later the show started and the group appeared on the stage.
While they were singing a man told me to clean the room where the singers get dressed.
Later, when the show had finished, I stayed with the group in their room for a few minutes.
Then, they went to the airport, and my dream finished.
What I really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and make-up , because I learnt how to do make-up for someone and I spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
Write to me soon.
I am writing this letter concerning the information you have asked me to give you.
First of all, I would like to thank you for giving me the chance to visit Camp California.
As far as I am concerned, my exams at school will have finished by the middle of June.
To be honest, I would like to spend a few days with my family, before I go to California.
Therefore, it would be better to go there in July.
July should be the hottest month! The best season for holidays.
Regarding the accommodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me of my holidays with my family.
Concerning the table of activities, I choose singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and have been a very keen singer from a very young age.
I joined my choir when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts.
I would be grateful if you would tell me how much money I will need with me.
I am really impressed with your interest in my experience at the concert.
I thought that you didn't like pop music and .
Anyway, I enjoyed it very much! It was the best experience I've ever had in my whole life.
I was trying to be with the singers all the time.
It was fantastic.
I wanted to touch them, as the only way to convince myself that I was with them.
I didn't really have to do anything special.
I just had to take care of them, serving some drinks and food during the rehearsals.
You have to try it once in your life and if you don't like it, don't do it again.
I'm really happy to know that I won your competition.
And first of all, before I ask for information about the trip, I want to say thanks a lot.
I would like to travel in July because it is the best time to take a break from my work.
Regarding the accommodation, if possible I would like to stay in a tent because I think it is a relaxing place to stay.
Furthermore because I like to live in contact with nature.
Also it is possible to meet a lot of people, and to chat during the night, perhaps around the fire, playing a and singing.
I think it is a nice way to have fun.
I'm really happy to know that it is possible to play sports.
I would like to play tennis and go swimming.
I choose tennis because it is a sport that you can play with other people, also because I like competitive sports.
The other sport that I would like to do is swimming.
Swimming is my favourite sport because you can relax your body and your mind.
I would like to ask you for further information about this trip.
Thanks for all the information.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you again.
After the discussion that we had in the English class, I understood that a lot of people sometimes don't enjoy shopping.
I can't understand these people because this never happens to me.
By the way, usually the people who don't like shopping are men or children.
I think it is difficult to find a woman who doesn't like shopping.
But I have to admit that sometimes I don't really like shopping, above all when I'm tired or when I'm not in the right mood.
In fact if I'm not in the right mood I become irritable because I can't find anything.
For me, .
 when I'm angry with somebody really close to me like my boyfriend or a member of my family, so to relax I go shopping and usually I enjoy it a lot.
The opposite situation is when I pass my exams and I really need to buy something as a present for myself.
About the information required, I would like to go in July because it is my half term at university and summertime would be ideal.
Regarding accommodation, I would rather stay in a tent.
I want to enjoy the wildlife and admire the landscape.
As regards leisure activities, my favourite is Basketball, which I have been playing for two years, because I have been selected for my university team and I think some time practising with players from different countries will help me develop my skills at an international level.
Secondly, I would like to play tennis, which is my hobby and I think it helps my mind to keep working.
I would like to ask you how much money I need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and whether I need anything else.
But the most exciting part of my job, and the one that I was looking forward to, was the last night of the concert, because all the staff were promised a party with all the members of the band.
That night was the best of my entire life.
I am sending you some pictures, the best ones only because there were some quite embarrassing ones.
Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got the prize of a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA.
Because of my business, I am very busy and this is the best time for my business so I can't organise any time to go on holiday, but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July.
I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin.
As you offered me two activities, I would like to go swimming.
I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be.
I have been learning to swim for the last eight months and I have been really enjoying it.
Another sport I have played is Basketball, which I used to play for the school's team when I was at secondary school.
I have not been playing it at all recently but only wish I had.
This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again.
It has been quite a long time since I last wrote to you.
I hope you are well.
I have something really exciting to share with you.
There was a Michael Jackson concert in my city last month.
It was a charity concert, which was organised by the university where I am studying.
My classmates and I, we were asked to decorate the stage, and clean the concert area.
But guess, Kim, what the most exciting thing for us was.
We were asked to be the singer's interviewer.
just asked him a couple of questions behind the stage.
I was so nervous that I couldn't remember what to say.
If you imagine yourself talking to a famous pop singer such as him, how do you think you would feel? But what I really enjoyed that evening was when we had our photographs taken with him after his concert and he signed them for us on the back of each picture.
We had a wonderful evening.
His concert was absolutely brilliant.
Everyone was screaming, shouting and dancing while he was singing.
I wish you had been there with us.
Is there anything happening over there? Please write to me when you have time.
I am looking forwards to hearing from you.
13.Jun.
2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition.
It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks.
Below is the information you requested from me.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach Korean children in Brighton about Korea and Korean history in early August.
Secondly, I would like to stay in log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them.
Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it.
And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doesn't mean I am bad at swimming.
Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.
Firstly, you cannot always get the right thing although you scour all the shops to find something you want.
You may only get tired  feet.
And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially on special occasions like during a sale.
Secondly, you cannot that you might get robbed by a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of how you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet .
In addition to this, even if you buy something you like, you can change your mind at home.
Sometimes, a moment comes that you would like to buy something you have not wanted because while you are shopping, you might get something beautiful or good to you.
So you spend more money than you had expected.
To sum up, you should spend money according to your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable.
Firstly, let me thank you for your nice letter of June 10th.
I was so surprised but so glad to read that I had won the first prize in your competition.
In response to your question and if you don't mind, I would prefer to travel in July because I've already booked my holiday and my boss won't give me another one.
I would be grateful if I could stay in a log cabin.
I'm not a young girl anymore and do appreciate a little bit of comfort.
As you asked me, my favourite activities would be painting and climbing.
I like the mountains very much and would particularly enjoy painting them after a walk.
Would you be so kind as to write to me as soon as possible because I need the precise date of the journey.
I've got four children and have to organise their time without their mother.
Furthermore, I would like to know exactly what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I should expect to spend there.
I'm really looking forward to hearing from you.
I received your letter last Monday.
I want to say thank you for making me the lucky person who won that competition.
It will be a great opportunity for me to see the United States and I am so happy about that I cannot explain it.
You want some further information from me.
About the date when I want to travel, can I say that it is only possible for me in July because I have to do some exams at school.
Regarding the accommodation at the camp, I would prefer a tent.
The reason is that I like to live really naturally and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent than in a cabin.
Regarding activities, I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me.
In basketball I have had more practice than in tennis.
I play every weekend in competitions with my local team and .
Also I want to know how many clothes and how much money I will need for these two weeks.
Please write to me with your answer as quickly as possible.
The organizer of the tour spoke with me and asked me if I wanted to do the same work in two months at the Rolling Stones concert Isn't that fantastic! I couldn't believe it but he gave me the contract to sign.
I hope, Kim, you were not too jealous about that, sorry.
Please write to me soon.
I'm waiting.
Thank you very much for the prize.
I went crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition.
I am looking forward to going to Camp California.
I've never been to the States before and having the chance to do so makes me really happy.
So let's answer the question you asked me to in order to make those two weeks there as much fun as possible.
You asked me when I would like to travel to California.
Definitely, in July.
That's my only month for holidays in the whole year.
If possible, I'd like to spend my time there in a tent.
I hope .
That's the most suitable accommodation for a camping holiday.
It keeps you in touch with nature.
That's what camping is about, isn't it? I've found the list of activities you sent me very interesting.
If I have to choose two of them I'll take tennis first.
I'm an expert on it and I'll have a good time beating everyone there.
Can't say the same about golf.
It will be my first experience on the green.
I just hope I don't get injured.
One thing you have not told me is whether I have to pay for everything myself in California or not.
Please, let me know.
As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part in the Sting concert here in Segovia.
No, not as a singer.
Not yet.
My only role was to carry things from one place to another.
Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular.
Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia.
Well, some others helped me with the task, but that did not make it much easier.
Anyway, it was a great experience and I enjoyed it very much.
The part I enjoyed most was the one when they paid me.
It wasn't much but that means nothing when you have the chance to take part in an event like that.
They also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live.
Great show.
I'm very happy that I won first prize in your competition.
Two weeks at California in the USA is the thing I dreamed about a lot.
You asked me few questions in your letter.
I would like to answer.
The only time for me to visit you is July.
I can come to USA in July because in August I will be working with my father.
We are building a new house for our family.
What about accommodation? I prefer tents to log cabins.
Nights in July are hot.
A tent will be cooler to sleep in than a cabin.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
Ten or fifteen years ago we had empty shelves in shops in Poland.
We could only buy things from Russia.
People always queued for stuff from the west.
If you had wanted something special for example for a gift you had to stay in a line all night.
It was the worst side of shopping in Poland a couple of years ago.
Nowadays we have capitalism, free market, lots of private shops, markets and supermarkets.
We can buy everything we imagine.
Polish supermarkets are not Polish-origin shops.
They are imported from another Western European country.
I appreciate these shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread.
On Friday evening and on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded.
They are filled with people who want to buy everything.
I am really surprised about the free trip to California, because I've never ever won anything before.
My summer holidays last for two months, but I only have time in July.
In August I am going to work in an office, so there is no possibility of travelling that month.
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin.
For one night it would not bother me to sleep in a tent, but for a period of two weeks it would be too uncomfortable.
At the camp I would like to go sailing a lot.
Once my family and I went to Greece and rented a sailing boat for three weeks.
Because my parents did most of the work, I don't know exactly how to handle a sailing boat.
As the second activity I have chosen to take photos.
I used to be the photographer on family holidays and I know how a camera works.
Finally I have some questions concerning the clothes I am going to need and approximately how much money I should take with me.
I just want to know what I will have to pay for myself.
The statement mentioned is perfectly in tune with my opinion.
If you want to buy new clothes for summer the biggest difficulty is to find a shop which sells what you are looking for.
Once you've found it you should take everything you like and go into the fitting room.
It's a big advantage to go shopping with a friend, because he or she can bring you all the clothes in the right size if the item you took doesn't fit.
Often it happens that the salesman hasn't got the size you need and that's always a pity.
After trying on about twenty different tops, dresses or jeans your legs and your back start to hurt terribly.
In the end you may have found only two or three things you really like, but they are worth all the work.
I have received your letter concerning two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
So I will answer your questions.
I would like to travel only in July because I think it's the best month for me to enjoy my holidays.
Regarding my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more comfortable than a tent and less hot .
However, I hope, there is water and light inside this log cabin.
1.
Surfing because I never do it and I would like to learn .
to be more successful.
Thank you for answering my different questions.
Shopping is great when you have lots of money and time; you can buy clothes, shoes, make-up; CDs, whatever.
But it's not easy for workers, because the shops close their doors about 5.30 pm (half past five).
When you work in an office, a factory, a company, you have the same hours as them.
So you can only go  shopping during your lunch break.
If not, you can go on Saturdays but it's hard, because there are too many customers.
You can't walk, or try clothes on, and it's very hot.
The saleswomen are too busy and haven't a moment to give you advice.
In England, .
It's different to the other European countries.
Sometimes the saleswomen aren't friendly, because they are stressed or they .
Finally I think it will be better if the shops stay open until 7.30 pm (half past seven).
It will provide a good service for their customers and be cooler for them.
I would also like to tell you which two activities I am keen to do at the Camp.
One of them is basketball, which I have been playing for over seven years, and I am the captain of my university basketball team.
The other one is tennis, which is also my favourite sport and I have been playing for several years.
I go to elementary school to teach children how to play tennis every Wednesday and Friday.
I am therefore writing to enquire about some things.
What I would like to know is what the weather is like so that I can bring appropriate clothes and also how much money I should bring.
Lastly, I would like to know how many people are coming to the Camp I will go to.
I should be grateful if you would send me the further information that I asked for and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Thank you very much for informing that I won the prize.
I was very pleased to hear that.
I am writing to give you the information you asked me for.
As for the date to travel, I would like to go there in July.
Owing to the summer course I take starting in August, July is the only month I have free time.
With regard to the place to stay, I would be most grateful if I could stay in a log cabin.
I never could sleep in a tent in my life.
I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities.
Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some pictures of beautiful scenery in California.
After photography, swimming is my best method of relaxation.
It would be great if I could go swimming during the stay.
First of all, if you want to buy nice dresses, the first thing you have to do is look around all the shops and department stores in a city.
If you are lucky enough, you might find them within 30 minutes, but if you don't, you might have to keep walking for several hours and still not find any!! That would be so exhausting.
To sum up, although there is certainly a good side to shopping, such as the pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for a long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.
I'm very pleased to receive this prize.
Thank you very much.
The only time I can travel to the U.S.A is in July, because that is the only time I can leave my work.
Other workers are other months so there is only July that is available for me.
About the accommodation at Camp California, I would like to stay in a tent.
I'm a very outdoor person, who likes to go camping and hiking, so a tent is like a second home to me.
At this point, I would like to know which airline I will be travelling on and if it is possible can you send me more information about Camp California.
Also I would like to know how long I will be staying at this camp so I can decide how much money I'm going to need and how many clothes I'm going to take.
I would like to thank you again for the prize that you have given me.
Filming life at school means filming the students' actions and behaviour.
We need to show what students' interests are and which subjects they are interested in.
I think Science is one of the interesting subjects in school.
It is very interesting and fun experiment.
Lots and lots of experiments produce quite interesting and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life.
We can see a lot of interested faces among the students while we are filming them.
Also it is not a very easy subject so we can capture other students' faces in confusion and puzzlement.
Also drama is one of the most fun and interesting subjects.
We can see students expressing their feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well well-known story.
Another exciting subject which most of the students like very much is P.E.
Many students like to play sports.
(I'm one of them).
It would be a good idea to have that in.
Plus you can use me as the main person because I'm very good at it.
I would like to thank you for your letter! I went in for your competition and I was really anxious about the results.
I am surprised that I won the first prize but also very happy about it! Therefore it is my pleasure to reply to your letter.
Firstly, I would like to arrive at the Camp in July if that is possible because I am working and I will not have spare time before then.
Secondly, you mention "tents or log cabins" as the accommodation provided.
I would rather stay in a tent than a log cabin in order to be close to nature.
I adore the sound of the wind, trees, animals and everything which surrounds me.
.
Thirdly, regarding the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming and tennis.
I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home.
I do a lot of sports, so apart from playing tennis I am a member of our local swimming centre.
I can assure you that I am gradually improving my sports skills.
Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I should bring with me.
Is the weather changeable? I was also wondering if I will need any money.
I would appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as possible.
There was a large stage which we had to sweep clean.
That was a little bit odd but funny at the same time.
Another thing we had to do was help the staff to move some equipment.
The musicians brought it in order to achieve a high standard of sound quality.
We had to be very careful.
Have you any idea how much this stuff is worth? You don't even want to know.
Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I gained from it! I've learned the meaning of the words "reliability" and "responsibility".
Anyway the result of the whole preparation is far more enjoyable and relaxing.
I would like to travel in July because I will have my holiday in July.
I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent.
I think it would be more comfortable than a tent.
I want to attend swimming and tennis courses.
I have been swimming since I was five years of age and until 1993 I was a member of the school team.
I am good at .
I am also good at playing tennis.
I won a prize in a competition in 1999.
If you could reply to my letter by the 28th of June I'd be grateful because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company.
Who doesn't like shopping? Everybody likes it, from a child to an old lady in her sixties, but it is not always enjoyable.
When you get home tired after spending all your morning and afternoon shopping you want to go to bed because you spent the whole day just looking for a suit and you couldn't find the perfect one.
The only thing is, we need to know what kind of thing we want to buy and where we can buy cheaper and better quality stuff.
We have a few possibilities.
We can look in a magazine or a which is delivered with the newspaper weekly.
We can order a free catalogue from big shops or companies monthly.
We can also watch some special channels on the television.
The easiest and latest way is internet shopping.
So you don't need to see long-faced staff in the shops.
You won't wait in the queue.
You don't need to go out to buy something.
You can order everything on the computer.
I think you won't be tired and bored at the end of your shopping on the computer.
Think about that way for enjoyable shopping.
I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you for the two weeks in California I have won in the competition.
California has always been in my dreams.
I will be leaving university in a few months' time but it is in my plans to continue my studies at another university, trying to do a two year master's.
Having decided to take a month off between university and , it would be great to have my holidays from 1st to 15th July.
I have always wanted to spend my holidays in a tent but my father has never given me permission, and this would be an ideal opportunity for me to learn about camp life.
I am a good swimmer and also good at golf (handicap twelve).
I took a certificate to become a teacher in both of them six years ago before I went to "CROARA GOLF" in Milan where I organised the evening's entertainment for the customers.
I hope that you can let me know, before I leave, how hot it will be so that I don't make a mistake choosing my clothes and approximately how much money I will spend.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Please do not hesitate to contact me on (0297) 8245123 in case you should need me.
I do not agree that it is preferable to phone the shop and give them a list of items you need instead of going to the shop and choosing whatever you want.
First of all, I believe that if someone has time to go to the shops .
I am writing to inquire whether it is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences regarding travel.
Indeed I would rather travel only in July since I'm going to work in August in order to earn money to pay for my studies next year.
Moreover I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I can't put up with mosquitos and other insects which come into tents.
 I've chosen two activities from the list: tennis (as I do this sport regularly and I'm very good at this activity) and golf because I don't know anything about this sport and I wish  to find out about it .
Don't hesitate to contact me in order to have further information.
As you already know, your English class is going to make a short video about daily life at your school.
That's why I'm writing a report suggesting which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
First of all, it seems obvious that we should, at least once, film a lesson with our English teacher who had the idea to make this short video.
Also I would suggest filming lunch in the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noise inside the restaurant because of the babbling.
At the end, in my opinion, it would be interesting to film a sports lesson in order that our parents realise that we improve our bodies' abilities, and not only our mental abilities at school.
I am very pleased to receive your letter, and read all the questions you have asked me.
Now, I will answer your questions.
I would like to go in July, because my summer holiday starts at that time, so I have more free time, and I want to stay in tents more than log cabins, because when we stay in a tent we are usually in the countryside.
At that time, I think it should be suitable for me.
Do you know I am amazing when it comes to playing tennis? I am on the first tennis team in my school, so I can my tennis skills during the holidays, and I can play basketball as well, but not very well.
You could say I only know how to play.
When you go shopping with your girlfriend, she wants to look at every item of clothing in the shopping centre, but you are not interested in that.
Romantic, no! I think you will feel bored.
, so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other.
If you go out with your same-sex friend that should be fine but if every time you go to the same place, everyone will feel bored.
I am very pleased with the prize that I have won and I would like to give you more information about me, because I would really really like to go to California.
I have always wanted to go to California.
First of all, I'm very ill at the moment and I need about a week to get better and I would like to travel within the next few weeks if that is possible (July 2000).
In accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation I would prefer to go and stay in tents, because I think they're unusual and that is not something that you do every day.
I would also like to ask you about the weather to see what kind of clothes I should take with me.
I would like to give you and the others in the class my opinion (concerning the video that you are going to make) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why.
Well, from my point of view the most interesting lessons that we have at school and which are useful in real life are maths because everything we do is all about maths.
The other lesson that I think is very important is physics for the same reason that maths is important.
On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we should all know WHERE we live, what the problems are that we have in this world, what problem every different country has and where the petroleum comes from and what the advantages and disadvantages of using it are and about the gold as well.
There are loads of things about geography that we OUGHT TO KNOW.
In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video.
You can put in a few activities (sports) like basketball, football, and tennis, but only those because they are very popular and people will be interested in them.
I would like to travel in July.
It is the only time of the year I have two weeks' holiday.
I would be grateful if you could give me a log cabin.
It is safer and there is no problem if it rains.
There are two kinds of shopping; the first one is shopping for fun.
You often see young ladies looking for the nicest dress, the most beautiful shoes and so on...
They are all excited when thinking about the party they have been invited to.
It is very nice when you can do your shopping like that.
The second kind of shopping is not enjoyable.
It is when you have to buy what is necessary for you: bread, butter, milk etc...
It is always the same.
You have to find the best article for the best price.
You are among thousands of people, but, at the same time, you are alone.
Besides, when you want to pay for the things you have chosen, you can believe that the ladies behind the cash desks are unable to smile.
After that, you have to carry your bag (of course far too heavy for you) to your car.
When you are at home, there is no reward except that your husband or your children notice that the fridge is full again.
Shopping is annoying but also necessary.
That is why it is not always enjoyable.
This is all that I wanted to ask.
Thank you for everything.
I suggest filming our English lessons and Maths lessons.
From the activities I suggest filming sports lessons and music lessons.
We have very interesting English lessons.
They are always funny and nice.
We always learn something new.
At some lessons students are always working, but as we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life.
Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special.
It's not true.
We practise our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way they do.
Also Maths lessons are so interesting.
Many people don't like Maths because they think that it's a boring subject.
I think it all depends on the teacher.
Our Maths teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons.
I think we should film the Maths lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Maths.
For activities, we should film sports lessons because we always do something new.
We have many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun.
Our music lessons are special.
We try to play many instruments, and sing even if we don't know how.
And it's always interesting to watch others while they do something like that.
I received your letter this morning.
I am very pleased to hear that I have won first prize in your competition.
.
And I would like to choose swimming as an activity at the camp.
My second choice is painting because I love watercolour painting and I am a member of the watercolour painting club in my town.
I would like to stay in a log cabin because I have had bad experiences with tents.
I do not like to stay in such a small space.
Lastly, I would like to know how much money I should bring with me, and could you give me an idea about what I must bring in the way of clothes and what I do not need .
We are all customers of the big supermarkets.
They have all that we need .
They are a bit far from town but they have huge car parks.
They give us lots of choice to buy what we need and what we can .
But when we think about it seriously, shopping is not enjoyable, for example, if you forget something that you need for a salad.
You have to go back to the supermarket and find the nearest parking space, then before someone takes the last fresh lemon for your salad, you must find out where the lemon section is, because they love to change the store around again and again.
When you get your lemon you have to go to queue to pay for the lemon.
As this shows, shopping has become one of our dislikes, because of the huge supermarkets.
I have recently received a letter saying I am the first-prize winner in your competition.
It was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details.
At Camp California, I would like to stay in a tent as I think it would be more enjoyable.
The two activities I would like to do are Photography and Sailing.
I think they are a good contrast.
I have not done sailing for quite a long time so I might find it difficult but I am looking forward to it.
As well as getting some good exercise, I would also like to be able to learn something new.
I have never done Photography before.
I also have some enquiries concerning the trip.
I would like to know what the weather is like at that time of the year so I am able to pack the essential clothing.
I would appreciate it if you also advised me on how much money I should take.
It is all new for me as I have never been to the USA before.
Thank you for your time and your kind efforts.
When you think of the word 'shopping' a smile always comes onto your face.
Shopping is thought of as enjoyable.
Teenagers go shopping for fun and to socialize.
There is more than one kind of shopping though and one particular kind is window shopping.
I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now.
Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money.
My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up on a high street to go shopping.
For me, that meant window shopping.
When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress.
As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on.
I fell in love with it.
I knew though that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway.
I went back every day just to eye that dress because I just couldn't get over the fact that I had no money.
When I received my monthly pay, I rushed down to the shop and without thinking, bought that dress.
I was back to where I was before - with no money (and a black dress) all over again.
Hello, how are you? I'm fine.
Thank you for the letter.
I got it today and couldn't believe it! asked me for some further information.
I will write it down.
I'd like to travel in July and this is the only time I can travel, because I am busy with a school project until the end of June and I am going to work in a hospital for the summer holidays in August and September.
First of all, we cleared all the seats.
There were so many seats that it took a long time to finish clearing.
Before the concert started, we sold some snacks and drinks and after that, we stood in front of the audience to prevent them from moving forward.
During the concert, all the fans try to get closer to the singers, jumping, shouting and so on and some of them faint when they get too excited.
We move them to a safe place so that they won't be kicked or stepped on by other mad fans.
I have received your letter.
I am very happy to have won the first prize.
I would like to go in July after taking my examination at college at the end of June.
So it is impossible for me to go earlier.
I would prefer to stay in a tent to staying in a cabin.
Because it is something I feel more familiar with.
I used to go camping with my family every summer.
I am quite good at swimming.
I won the first prize at the Regional Championship six years ago.
But I think I'd rather do other activities which you list in your letter, like tennis.
I have been playing this game with my friends and I like it.
I would be pleased if you could give me some more information about the accommodation, and some advice about the clothing () I should wear and how much money I should take with me.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
It's not even healthy for your pockets.
I just wonder how much time we spend shopping at the supermarket or how much time we spend buying clothes.
Me, for example, I don't particularly like shopping.
When I go on my own, it can be boring.
My sister loves shopping.
She could stay in a shop all day trying on clothes.
I agree that most people enjoy buying clothes, food, something for the house, presents etc.
Because it is something that goes with their culture.
I am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me I have won first prize in your competition.
I am glad.
Thank you very much.
Now I am answering your questions and then I would like to know some further information about travel and accommodation.
I would like to travel in July because in June I am going to take some exams at university and at the moment I do not know the exact date.
I can tell you I am only free in July.
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I am not keen on tents and I think that a log cabin is more comfortable than a tent.
As regards the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp I would like to do painting and photography.
I paint in oils from life and my subjects are landscapes, people, animals.
I also like taking photographs, for example during my journeys or trips.
So when I go back home I can use my best pictures to reproduce them as a painting.
There is somebody who says that 'Shopping is not always enjoyable,' and who is happy only when he can go shopping.
First I do not think that shopping is enjoyable when you must do it in a hurry or as a duty.
If you have to run from one shop to another, always looking at your watch, going shopping is a terrible activity.
On the other hand if you can walk around without any time problem with a good friend I think that shopping is very enjoyable.
For instance, it is fun to enter a clothes shop and try on a skirt or a T-shirt although you do not buy anything.
To sum up I enjoy wasting money whether buying useful things or not.
I often like buying gifts for my relatives and friends.
In my opinion, shopping is relaxing, above all on Saturdays when you have finished a working week and you are expecting a wonderful Sunday.
I am writing with reference to your letter and I would like to give you some information which I have been asked for.
Because my course finishes at the end of June and I am going to work for a hotel in August and September, I would like to travel in July.
That is the best time for me.
As far as accommodation is concerned, I would like to say that I prefer to stay in tents.
I like staying in tents because when we go on holiday with my friends, we always stay in tents, so I am used to staying in tents.
Moreover, I have also been asked to choose some activities.
I would like to choose basketball and swimming.
When I was at school, I played for the school team and I am good at swimming.
Finally, could you let me know what sort of clothes would be best to bring.
It would also be useful to know how much money to bring.
I have discussed this subject with my friends and schoolteachers.
Here is some information about daily life at I.S.O.
Morning Lessons: Although there are a lot of classes, there is a special FCE class in which students are being prepared for the FCE exam.
There are special methods and materials for students.
Afternoon Lessons: The aim of the afternoon lessons is to .
There are some discussion groups, so students may have a discussion on any subject.
Break Time: We have a lot of facilities for break time.
.
In my opinion we should choose break time activities.
Because there are a lot of activities which students take part in, it would be much better for video .
I have just received your letter informing me that I won a two week holiday at Camp California, so I am writing to you to tell you my preferences for the travel and the accommodation.
I have no particular needs but one: it will be necessary for me to travel in July because my work will keep me very busy in all the other months.
About the accommodation, I have no problems, but I would prefer staying in a tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous.
During the holiday, I would like to play tennis and golf.
I can play tennis quite well, but I have never played golf, so, if it is possible, I would like to take lessons with a teacher.
I would like to know also what I will have to pay for with my money and how the weather is at Camp California, because I have to decide which clothes to bring.
I look forward to your reply.
People often have very different opinions about shopping.
Most women and girls like it, especially when they want to buy clothes and shoes.
A man is usually less interested in shopping, maybe because he frequently has to pay for what his wife has bought.
In my opinion, shopping can be interesting in big stores, where you can find everything, or in shops which sell something special or strange.
On the other hand, I don't like going to shops where you see only common things, and I hate it when it is crowded.
In this case, you have to stay in long queues, you can't walk without being pulled or pushed, and you often have to spend an hour buying some soap or a packet of biscuits.
Even if you are with a friend, you can't talk, because of the noise and the confusion, and you may find it difficult also to walk close to each other.
The best thing to do to avoid queues and crowds is not to go shopping on Saturdays, but it is not always possible.
I received your letter and I'm very happy because I didn't expect it, so first of all I want you to know that I really going to Camp California in the U.S.A.
for two weeks, especially because I've never been to this country.
On the one hand I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could take this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams for September.
If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out.
 I think I would rather not sleep in a tent because I had a bad experience once and I would like to try log cabins.
Although it wouldn't be a problem if I had to sleep in a tent.
Another point is that I have already chosen two activities and they are basketball and golf.
They are the best activities for me because I think I am good at both and I used to play them .
Finally I want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
I look forward to receiving a reply from you.
The concert was in the university in the middle of the field and at the beginning when we arrived there weren't many people, only those who had to prepare the stage and the sound system and of course us, who had the job of serving drinks during the concert.
We arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place.
I was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't help it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't believe it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream.
Well I think I'm going to remember it all my life and I'm sure that if you had been there you would have enjoyed it very much.
 IN REFERENCE TO YOUR LETTER DATED 28 MAY I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR INFORMING ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION RESULT.
I AM VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT I AM THE winner OF THE COMPETITION ORGANISED BY YOUR COMPANY LAST MONTH.
IT IS VERY PLEASING TO KNOW THAT I HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEND TWO WEEKS AT CAMP CALIFORNIA IN THE USA, WHERE I HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE.
ACCORDING TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING TRAVEL TIME, ACCOMMODATION PREFERENCES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH I LIKE TO DO.
ANSWERING THE FIRST QUESTION - I WOULD LIKE TO TRAVEL IN JULY.
THE REASON IS I AM WORKING FOR THE TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANY AS A MARKETING SPECIALIST AND WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE BIGGEST TELECOMMUNICATION FAIR IN THE WORLD WHICH IS TAKING PLACE IN SEPTEMBER.
WE WILL BE WORKING ON THIS FOR THE WHOLE OF AUGUST SO THE ONLY ONE VACATION MONTH I CAN GO IS JULY.
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED.
I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL.
REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY.
I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS.
THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS.
PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.
PEOPLE LIKE DOING SHOPPING (ESPECIALLY IN POLAND, WHERE MANY NEW AND MODERN SUPERMARKETS HAVE BEEN OPENED) LADIES PREFER TO VISIT UNDERWEAR SHOPS OR DEPARTMENTS IN HUGE HYPERMARKETS AND MEN ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY CAN BUY SOMETHING NEW FOR THEIR CARS, MOTORBIKES OR COMPUTERS.
PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD LIKE GOING TO DO SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS OF FAMILY (IT'S EASIER TO CHOOSE THE REALLY NEEDED THINGS FOR KITCHEN OR BATHROOM, TO GET SOMETHING TASTY FOR DINNER, LUNCH OR BREAKFAST).
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL.
THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP.
THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD FROM CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER.
THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRLFRIENDS.
ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SIT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER .
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR THIS SITUATION (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP ASSISTANT, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS).
THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE).
ANYWAY EVERYBODY SHOULD DO SHOPPING AS PEOPLE NEED TO EAT, NEED CLOTHES AND MANY OTHER IMPORTANT THINGS TO LIVE.
EVEN IF THE SHOPPING IS NOT ALWAYS ENJOYABLE PEOPLE HAVE TO BUY THINGS (AND SPEND MONEY).
BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN CHOOSE THE WAY TO DO IT.
IT ABSOLUTELY DEPENDS ON LIFESTYLE, PERSONALITY AND NEEDS.
Thank you for your letter.
I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I can go only in July because I'm a student.
It's summer holiday at that time.
I want to know if it is available at that time.
First of all, I would be pleased if the accommodation was in a log cabin because I'm afraid of insects and it's wet in the tent.
It'll make me like the village.
I like painting, and once I won first prize in the university competition.
I think I'll have a chance to draw some pictures, and I'll show them to my friends who have never been there before.
The other activity I would prefer is sailing.
My father was a sailor when I was child.
I was dragged into learning sailing.
I'm good at it.
It would be exciting.
Furthermore, I would like to ask you which kind of clothes I need to take and how much money I'll spend.
Recently we had a class discussion about shopping.
All of the students agree that shopping is not always enjoyable.
Women always enjoy shopping.
But a lot of inconveniences annoy them.
So they said they do not always enjoy shopping.
First of all the parking is not convenient and is expensive.
Sometimes you can't find a place to park your car.
Sometimes you have to park your car in a place then walk to the supermarket.
Furthermore, when you look around the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you want to buy.
It's very confusing without the right signs.
Sometimes you get lost in the supermarket.
 Additionally, men never like shopping.
While their wives are doing the shopping they sit in the car or read a newspaper.
They would be happy if there were sports and leisure facilities in the supermarket.
Then they'd change their mind.
Instead of hating shopping they would enjoy shopping.
In my opinion, nowadays, shopping is not always enjoyable.
I have just received your letter and, firstly, I would like to thank you for this good news.
I will give you the information which you asked me for in your letter and also I will ask you some questions.
As I understand, it is very important to confirm the date of my trip.
I would rather choose July because it is the only month when I have got holiday long enough to spend it travelling abroad.
Now about accommodation.
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a tent.
As I am young I would like to be a romantic person and to be closer to nature.
I think it will be the best way to understand what California means.
To answer your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming.
I am quite good at tennis, especially playing doubles.
Also I like swimming and I've got two years' experience of teaching swimming at a leisure centre.
Could I ask you some questions about clothes and money? Should I take some clothes for the cold weather? The last question - could you give me some idea about how much money I will need.
As a woman, as a mother and, finally, as an ordinary person, I go shopping quite often.
Do I enjoy it? If I told you "yes" or "no", I'd tell you nothing.
Shopping is part of my life.
Sometimes I hate it.
I can't concentrate in a shop, and I can't relax either.
I am looking on the shelves but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list.
Everybody is pushing me and I think that I came to the wrong place.
On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really necessary.
I also understand that nobody will do that in my place.
However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me for something special and tasty.
To be honest, sometimes I like shopping.
I think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
When I am with my children I can teach them to read, to count only if they don't run away from me to educate themselves in the huge world, the name of which is "shopping".
I'm so happy and excited to receive this letter about the fact that I've won the first prize in your competition.
I prefer staying in tents to staying in log cabins.
I think staying in tents is more comfortable for sleeping.
Also I am not very keen on sleeping with too many people in the same place.
Also, for example, you really like some shoes or clothes, when you want to buy them, someone tells you "I'm sorry, this one is sold out"! What a pity! You become unhappy immediately.
Thank you very much for your recent letter.
I cannot believe that I won the first prize (it's great!) and, of course, I am very happy.
As for your questions, I am free to travel only in July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams.
And, I have to return to my university by August.
I prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I am not used to narrow spaces and feel more comfortable with a place like a bedroom.
Furthermore, I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and fascination for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife.
Finally, please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring? And how much will I spend there? Also, please advise me regarding any things it is necessary to prepare and bring.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Last month, I .
It was a big one and I couldn't have imagined how amazing it was.
I didn't know what was my responsibility until they called me to be trained.
What a surprise! And unbelievably, I was responsible for looking after the pop stars.
You might understand how excited I was.
But, I got through it.
I had to take care of them during the break, serving drinks, clothes, I even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted.
I think they are so hospitable and warm with people around them.
You know, because of this all my opinions about the self-important behaviour of superstars have changed.
What I most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures.
Marvellous thing! And of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
I hope you're well and enjoyed the CD and don't forget to write back all about your news from during your summer holiday job.
I am really happy to receive a letter about Camp California from you.
I am excited and looking forward to camping there.
I would like to travel in July because I have an important exam in September.
Plus, it may be lovely weather at that time in the U.S.A.
I would like to choose singing and tennis.
I used to go to KARAOKE with my friends in Japan as I really like to do that, anytime.
On the other hand, I have played tennis for nearly 7 years and it is also one of my hobbies.
By the way, last month I was in that pop concert which you mentioned in your last letters.
Can you believe it? Actually, I helped to sell tickets at the reception.
I've sold tickets before but not in that kind of big pop concert.
Before it was packed into by the audience, we had to clean around the reception, but it was really exciting although I was just a member of staff in the small reception, because I felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queueing.
I would rather travel in July because I'm not as busy as in June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and they aren't very cosy.
Regarding the activities, I've chosen swimming as I'm very keen on it and I'm fairly good at it, and I expect the water to be crystal clear.
I've also chosen singing.
I'm an awful singer, but I would like to learn.
I would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as I am a very strict vegan, and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring.
I'm really looking forward to my stay at Camp California and to your reply .
70% of students think we should film the Speech and Drama lesson because it is one of the lessons they enjoy the most.
60% of students say breaks should be filmed too, because they want to show in the video that they can also have fun at school.
Most of them said Science, English and Literature shouldn't be filmed because they are not very interesting and are very boring.
In my opinion I think basketball should be filmed too because it is one of the activities the students are very keen on doing and they usually enjoy it.
But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows what breaks are like and what students do during them.
In a nutshell I think Maths, basketball, Speech and Drama, and History should be filmed.
Since I have some serious back problems, I would prefer to sleep in a cabin.
Regarding your activities, I have picked basketball, because I love it: I play in a local club and I have been playing for twelve years, so I guess I am a "good" player.
I have also chosen photography from your list.
That part of California must be beautiful and I would love to bring home some "well-taken" photos of the area.
We decided to make a short film about our school as it would be seen through the eyes of an imaginary student.
It will be called "A day in the life of the mysterious student X." It will be shot just as if the viewers were student X, not seeing him but being him.
He will have breakfast, take a shower, get dressed, etc - so will the viewers.
At school we want to show "sights and sounds" from all the lessons (about 5 minutes each).
Student X will answer questions, speak with his classmates, even cheat at an exam! During the chemistry and biology classes, "we" will carry out experiments.
Of course we will also show other activities, such as PE, the lunch break and the theatre workshop.
We expect to show our finished product during the graduation party.
In reply to your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize.
It was a real surprise for me.
I would like to travel only in July, because I am going to study at my university until the end of June.
I hope it will not be any problem for you.
I am glad that all accommodation and travel costs have been paid.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin, I think it is more comfortable.
I see people who run the camp are very good at organizing the social life of their guests.
I have a lot of possibilities for spending my spare time.
The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most.
Generally I paint some landscapes by using watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impressionist era by using blobs, oil paint and canvases.
Finally I would like to ask what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money I will need for the normal life at the camp.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be shown in the video film about daily life at our school.
In order to prepare it I visited some classrooms during the lessons and I interviewed a number of students from our school.
Some of the teachers are very good professionals.
Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
For example, the teacher of history and Polish language is able to interest students in the subject in different ways.
According to students' opinions, the most popular activities are basketball, tennis, swimming and also the photography group and the painting team.
It is surprising that 45 per cent of the students questioned frequent one of these sports groups and 30 per cent of people go to the photography group.
On the whole our school has a lot of different possibilities for the students that we can show in our film.
It could make the video more interesting.
I recommend showing our history teacher.
It will show that during every day we have great fun and we receive good, important knowledge.
I have received your letter and I would like to reply to it.
To begin with, I can join the camp only in July.
My school starts a summer holiday from 1st July and I am going to take a summer course from August.
Therefore, I would like to travel in the middle of July.
I also would prefer log cabins for accommodation.
It seems more comfortable than tents.
Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis as activities.
I belonged to a swimming club and I got second prize in a competition last summer.
I am good at tennis as well as swimming.
There are some advantages when people go shopping.
They can relax, reduce their stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
Moreover, if they buy some nice things at a sale, they must be very satisfied.
However, shopping sometimes makes them stressed.
People often waste money on worthless things.
Then, they really regret it.
On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one.
In addition, a shop assistant gives them wrong advice.
To sum up, there are many disadvantages as well as advantages.
If people want to enjoy shopping, they must consider before buying something - do I really want it? I also recommend window shopping.
It is the best way to enjoy shopping.
You do not have to waste money at all.
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in "Camp California in the USA".
I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July.
I am finishing my studies in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job.
I would prefer to stay in a tent during your camp.
I have always dreamt about sleeping in a tent, in sleeping bags, but my parents always took me to expensive hotels, so it would be a nice adventure for me.
Shopping could be fun! Sometimes I like doing it during long Sundays.
I like going between colourful shelves and picking some nice things for dinner or for decorating our house with.
I love talking with my mum during shopping, meeting new people or old friends.
Next, another not very enjoyable thing about shopping is spending money! When I go to the big supermarkets I always spend more than I was going to.
You just cannot resist buying another bottle of body lotion or another box of soap because they smell so nice can you?! I always become very angry with myself afterwards, but I cannot help it.
Thank you for the amazing information about the competition.
I am really glad to be able to win the first prize and travel to the U.S.A., which I used to dream of.
Now, I would like to reply to some questions you ask, willingly.
Firstly, I would like to travel only in July because I study at University at the moment.
However, they will give me such a long holiday, enough to travel for two weeks in June.
I would prefer staying in tents to log cabins, as I'd like to observe nature and stay outdoors as much time as I can.
I'm very happy with the activities you organised.
I am good at playing basketball, swimming, tennis, surfing, as they have been my hobbies for donkey's years.
I would rather play golf and go sailing, than the others, so as to find new hobbies in my life.
Finally, what I would like to ask is what sort of clothes are suitable for travelling, and also, how much money should I prepare for the trip, approximately.
I would be grateful if you could reply to my letter with some further information soon.
Anyway, I joined the team which helps at a pop concert last month, as you know.
In my view, it was extremely interesting and satisfying for me all the concert long.
Talking of my work, I mostly had two prepare the concert stage with some .
If you chose the post, you would be thoroughly exhausted at the end of the concert.
However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert.
As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby.
Although I cannot explain any more about the thing I felt during the concert in this letter, I'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert .
It must be a good experience and a special memory for you.
See you and write to me soon.
I am pleased to have received your letter that informed me that I have won the first prize in your competition.
I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California, because I have never been to the U.S.A.
I would prefer to travel only in July, because I don't have to work and because I would prefer to stay in a tent and so I think that July is the best time to spend two weeks in a tent.
I have just been staying in a tent and I think it is always a beautiful and interesting adventure.
During the holiday I would do surfing and photography.
I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I went on a surfing course for five years and I won a lot of prizes.
I also like photography because .
I would like to receive further information about what kind of clothes I should wear during my holiday and I would like to know if I should bring with me a lot of money.
Looking forward to spending my holiday in the USA, I wait for your letter.
I am afraid that I couldn't write to you immediately, but last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so I was very busy.
Even if the job was very hard, it was an amusing experience.
I woke up at six a.m.
and I worked until nine p.m.
but it wasn't a problem for me, because I like spending my time with other people.
I particularly liked meeting people from different countries and some pop-stars, who were friendly towards us.
I was surprised at the co-operation that there was , because it was like a big family, where each member helps the others.
Looking forward to seeing you as soon as possible.
.
First of all I would like to travel in July.
I think that this is the ideal month for a trip to California.
This period the days are sunny and the weather won't prevent me from doing a lot of activities.
Regarding the accommodation I would prefer to stay in a cabin.
I think that the cabins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes.
The two activities I have chosen are swimming and climbing.
I selected swimming because this is one of my hobbies and I'm good enough at this activity.
In addition I would like to swim in a sea like California's because it is clean and beautiful.
I chose climbing because I'm interested in this sport even though I'm not experienced.
I like it because it offers you a lot of adventure and action.
As you asked me I will write to you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert.
All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful .
Before the concert I helped with carrying and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit.
It was very hard and at the end I was very tired.
At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinks to the audience.
I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.
It was really a very beautiful experience.
It offered me more pocket money and besides this I had the chance to make a lot of friends because there were many children who wanted to help too.
In addition I had the opportunity to talk to the singers and get a lot of autographs by them.
I will never forget these days and I definitely will take part in activities like this in the future.
I have received your letter and I am so happy because I have won the holiday in California.
It will be a pleasure for me to give you the information that you need.
First of all I would like to travel in July because I am going to Ibiza with my parents in June and in August I start to work part-time, so I am afraid that I can go only in July.
With reference to the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin to a tent.
I think log cabins are more comfortable and I have never slept in a tent.
I am very good at playing basketball.
When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I play at least every weekend.
I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos of animals.
First of all, I was too busy but it did not matter because I enjoyed this experience a lot.
I was doing different activities, from designing fliers to selling tickets.
I had to search the Internet for pictures that could be used for the flier.
We booked the accommodation for the group.
I was responsible for checking the light and sound.
In addition I checked the e-mail daily and answered the phone.
As you know, I sold tickets in some schools and pubs, too.
Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experiences of my life, but the day of the concert was really amazing.
I think this was the best of all.
I feel really happy that I participated in this event.
If you have the opportunity of getting involved in something like this do not hesitate.
It was a wonderful surprise when I received your letter.
Thank you very much for this great opportunity.
Now, I am writing this letter to reply to your questions.
Secondly, for accommodation, I prefer to say in log cabins, as I have no experience staying in a tent, I hesitate to try.
Regarding the activities, I would rather choose singing and painting, as unfortunately, I am not good at sports.
However, I enjoy singing.
I used to belong to the singing club when I was a high school student and once we won the contest, moreover, painting is one of my favourite hobbies.
I normally take brushes, paints and paper instead of a camera when I travel.
Finally, I would like to ask you whether there is anything I should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
Thanks for your letter.
Yes! It was a privilege to help at a pop concert.
I really wished you were there with me.
Believe it or not, it was a concert of "the Rolling Stones"! I did various things for them.
 Then, I helped tuning the instruments for the back band.
Actually, as I know nothing about instruments, the only thing I could do was just turn the volume up and down following the musician's instruction.
 the first prize in the competition.
It's my pleasure to give you some information and I'd like to ask you about the Camp California.
First of all, I'd like to travel only in July because I'm supposed to be a volunteer at the Music festival, held in August.
I'd like to choose swimming and photography as activities.
I go swimming three times a week so I have no problem with swimming.
I'm also a member of the photography club at my university and really keen on taking a picture of nature.
By the way, I'm wondering what kinds of clothes I should pack and how much I should bring with me.
I'll look forward to hearing answers from you.
The aim of this report is to summarize the results of the survey, which is about making a short video.
Preferred lessons.
 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active.
Additionally, 15% of students answered that they want the presentation lesson to be filmed.
The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn at presentation does his or her best.
Preferred activities.
The soccer game, played every Monday, was ranked as the most popular activity by 45% of students.
They said the soccer game enables them to get together and have fun.
However, the girls would rather play table tennis or badminton.
activity was chosen by 20% of students, followed by the soccer.
To sum up, according to the survey, it's obvious that more than half of the students want the acting lesson to be filmed.
Moreover, it seems that the students prefer the soccer game to be filmed.
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize.
It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp.
I am writing to reply to your questions.
 I will only be able to travel in July, because I have to finish my first year at the university.
It finishes 29th of June.
In addition to this, I have already resistered on another course which starts from 2nd of August.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in tents, I have always admired outdoor life.
Finally, I would like to do surfing and golf.
In the case of surfing, I have never had any experience, I am an absolute beginner.
On the other hand, I used to play golf with my father.
When I was 14, I won a competition.
I would like to ask about Camp California.
Let me know which kind of clothes I have to take and how much money I need.
It would be very helpful.
Well, last month, I worked at a pop concert.
It was fantastic because I could see Madonna.
My main job was to tidy up her dressing room.
Can you imagine? You are working with your ideal woman, I still can't believe that I spoke with her.
Anyway, the most important thing was that I had a good experience.
If we had worked together we would have had a good time.
It's a pity, isn't it? Now, I know how difficult it is to sing in front of an audience and behind the stage there are a lot of people who help the performance.
I would like to travel to the Camp in July, if possible.
This is just one month which I have free.
 I'm a student.
My school starts in September and it finishes in June.
July is the month when I'm having a rest and I'm doing nothing.
In August I'm working in a shop which is my sister's.
If I could go in July that would be grate.
I can sleep in a tent, it would remind me of a good time which I had with my friends a few years ago.
I'm not scared of darkness, rain, cold or hot weather.
I'm sure it would be good fun; sleeping next to each other telling scary stories.
It is good for making friends, you can know them better doing everything together.
Also I know that I have the chance to do two activities while I'm at the Camp.
I would like to choose basketball.
This is a sport which I ,,love".
I have been playing basketball since I was 12.
Some of my friends say that I'm a very good player, but I don't think so.
Another sport which I'd like to do is swimming.
I'm not as good at swimming as I am at basketball, but I'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it.
I would like to ask you, what sort of clothes should I take with me? I don't want to take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costume, T-shirt, sports shoes I think should be O.K.
How are you? I'm fine.
I'm so excited.
Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine.
It was a Tina Turner concert! At this moment when I think of it I want to shout.
After the concert we were invited backstage.
Then I could see her very, very clearly.
Only people who were helping and organizing this concert could meet her.
Some of them were speaking with her, I wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm happy, that I could be there.
I am writing to provide the information that you need from me.
First I would like to thank you for organising this competition and I would also like to thank you for the prize.
Answering your questions, I would like to travel only in July because this is the month of my vacation.
In July I will be free to travel anywhere I please.
According to your letter, I have two options regarding accommodation, either in tents or log cabins.
I would prefer a tent because I think that is something more exciting and new for me.
I have never stayed in a tent in the middle of nowhere in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new.
Log cabins may be more comfortable.
On the other hand I think that I will be able to "survive" in a tent.
Looking at your letter, I can see many options for activities and I realize that I like most of them.
I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting.
The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast with each other.
I want one that is more exciting and that asks for more agility and another that is calmer and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint.
Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good at it, however, I hope that I can learn about it at the Camp.
Painting is something that I love and I am very good at it.
Please answer my letter as soon as possible.
There was a concert with a famous band here in my city.
I wish you had been here with me.
So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans.
We bought tickets to the show and also to the fans' bus.
Yes, there is a bus that takes you to the concert and brings you back.
The concert was going to start at 22:00 and the bus arrived at my house at 18:00.
When we got inside it, we saw a lot of fans wearing T-shirts, caps and shouting, "Almendegos, Almendegos..." (that is the name of the band).
We sat and started to eat and talk.
Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures.
They were very interesting and we liked him very much.
After a few minutes (I thought they were a few) I realized that the coffee house was empty.
I looked at my watch: 20:45.
The bus had left about fifteen minutes before.
The man offered us a ride.
We accepted.
You cannot imagine how disappointed I was with myself.
We started to put everything on the stage and after this we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
The vocalist of the Almendegos was by my side and he touched my arm.
I will never wash my arm again.
After all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that I most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
I hope that you liked my experience.
I received your letter and I am very glad I have won a two-week trip to Camp California.
I will give you some information which will help you to know me better.
I would like to travel to the camp in July because this is the best time for me and I hope for you.
I will be very busy in June so let me tell you some details about my trip.
Regarding accommodation, I think tents would be great.
Basketball and swimming I think are the best for the children.
Basketball will help the children to build team spirit and leadership skills.
And swimming is very good for their health.
I swim really well and I am a professional basketball player.
I my experience.
Last month I enjoyed helping at the concert of "Modern Talking'' and now I want to share with you my experience.
I had taken on very demanding work.
I had to bring food for Peter Bolen and Tomas Anders.
Can you imagine? I went into their room and gave hot Cheeseburgers, Coca-Cola and ice-cream to Peter.
It was the happiest moment of my life.
He asked me whether the cheeseburger was hot and I answered that it was.
I was very nervous talking with him.
He told me about a concert programme and gave me his photo with an autograph.
Firstly, I can only travel in July because I have no time except in July as I am a postgraduate student.
I would very much like to stay in a log cabin.
I think it is a wonderful idea to stay in a tent only for a few days but not over 3 days.
It will be more comfortable to stay in a log cabin.
Regarding two activities, I will choose swimming and photography.
I am not good at swimming but I would very much like to learn how to swim this year.
On the other hand, I am very good at photography as I was a photographer in a club while I was in college.
Lastly I would particularly like to know about clothes and money.
Isn't it cold at night in the Camp California? I like ice cream, sweets and beverages very much, especially in the summer.
Are these expensive? Could you please tell me about these? I am looking forward to your reply.
When you go shopping, you can see various products and even very extraordinary things.
You can also see more graceful and fine things.
You usually visit many shops and compare the quality and the price and select the best one which suits you.
On the other hand, it usually takes a lot of time to get exactly what you want, because you have to visit many shops and see many things.
If the shopping mall is not , it is physically hard to get what you want.
It's not easy to shop with someone who is not interested in shopping.
In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think.
It depends on the situation.
It even varies depending on the people whom you shop with.
I am writing to you regarding the letter you sent me about the two weeks at Camp California that I won.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off at the beginning of the month.
For the accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I like adventure and simplicity.
Concerning the available activities, firstly, I would choose climbing because I have done it for many years.
Secondly, I am interested in trying something that I have never done, so I would like to do sailing.
I thank you in advance and look forward to your reply.
I'm writing to you to tell you about my experience helping at a pop concert last month.
The first day the site with fences.
The last day, which was day of the concert, was absolutely fantastic.
The audience was so excited to see the concert that we had to place some bouncers in front of the stage to stop people .
Finally, the concert was exactly what the people were expecting.
Thank you for your letter, which I have just received this morning.
I am really pleased to hear that I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am writing this letter to give you more information about myself.
I would like to travel only in July because I will have a summer holiday for 2 months at that time.
I would prefer to stay at Camp California in tents because it would be nice to spend the time living in tents with a nice environment and fresh air.
Also I would like to do two activities while I am at the Camp, which are swimming and photography.
Photography is quite interesting for me; I like to take photographs in a place where I have never been to before.
Swimming is quite a nice way to relax and work out.
It is really enjoyable to keep my body fit and healthy by swimming.
Thanks for your last letter.
I'm really sorry it's taken me so long to reply.
How are you doing? I hope that you can get on well with your roommate.
Anyway, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month.
I and my friend Emma helped to paint the scenery on the stage.
As you know, I like drawing and painting when I have some free time so that is why I chose to paint the scenery .
I really enjoyed painting it and it looked very nice.
And I particularly liked the experience of helping to and paint a picture of "Bon Jovi" on every T-shirt which was given to the audience.
I felt that it was a great time in my life.
However, I told my teacher that I am willing to lend a hand next time.
Are you willing to lend a hand next time? If you are, I'll tell you about it in advance.
I must stop writing now as I have a lot of homework to do.
You asked me to write about the experience which I had helping at the pop-concert.
And I can say it was terrific! My job was actually to listen to Tim and do whatever he said.
This included cleaning up the rooms which were used by the singers and putting some equipment on the stage.
Tim was in charge of organising this concert.
I had never been behind the stage before and you know the rooms, in which singers dress and apply make-up, are actually small.
Can you imagine, I could be at this concert without paying anything! And I managed to speak to Ricky Martin backstage.
O.K., I actually asked him only: 'How are you?' and he gave me his autograph.
He was fantastic.
You know that he is my favourite singer.
I think this was my best job as a student in Cambridge.
Probably it wasn't so nice to do jobs which you were told to do, but you saw many stars backstage.
And you had a chance to speak to some pop-stars.
Beside this, I earned some money - not a lot but enough for me.
I have just received your letter and I am writing to answer your questions.
I can travel only in July because it is the only month this year that I will be available, because I finish school in June, so I will be very busy then, and in August I start to study at University, so July is the best month for me to travel.
Accommodation for me is not a problem.
I am very easy going and I will be satisfied wherever I am.
But if I have to choose, I prefer to sleep in tents, because when I travel I usually sleep in that kind of accommodation so, for me they seem very comfortable.
- Tennis because it is my favourite sport and I enjoy playing it.
I have played tennis since I was a child and I have won some competitions in my town so I think I play very well.
I am a terrible climber but with a little bit of help I think I can enjoy the activity and have a good time that will be unforgettable.
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in the U.S.A.
Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring on the trip.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Thank you for your letter.
It was great to hear from you.
Sorry, but I haven't written to you because I've been very busy.
Last month I helped at a pop concert.
It was marvellous.
I have a friend and she knows that I speak English, so she offered me work with an English singer and I said, "Yes, of course".
But you can't imagine who the singer was.
It was Sting.
Can you imagine? You know, he is my favourite singer.
My job was very easy.
I had to help Sting with everything, for example, if he wanted water, I had to give him water.
It was marvellous.
He was very kind to me.
We talked about many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have dinner.
Yes, I know what you're thinking, "Dinner and Sting".
Yes, my friend, it was the best thing to happen to me in my life.
I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoke English very well.
The best thing was I spoke in English and I met my favourite singer.
I hope my friend calls me again to work for him because I had a wonderful time and it was a great and unforgettable experience.
P.D.
I have sent you an autograph that Sting wrote for you.
First of all, you have asked me when I would like to travel.
Actually, I could only travel in July, when I have my school vacation and I will be totally free.
From the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - and Photography - about which I know just the basic skills.
I would like to know if I should take any winter clothes, and I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money is necessary for the trip.
With the increase in violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres.
In fact, shopping may be very enjoyable, as people with new products, take a look at shops, buy something or just walk around.
But it can also be dangerous.
First, most areas in shopping centres use artificial illumination and air conditioning, which are bad for our health.
Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring.
Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumerism may develop into a compulsion.
There are cases of people that cannot spend one day without buying anything.
After all that, we can that shopping can be a good as long as we can choose other enjoyable activities for our free time.
It was a great pleasure to hear from you that I have won first prize in your competition.
I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but still I would like to know how much money I have to take with me.
I would to travel only in July for family reasons.
Another point is accommodation.
I would be more than happy if you could provide me with a tent.
The reasons are the following: a tent promotes a better relationship with nature, and is a great opportunity to improve my health.
Also I would like to tell you which activities I would like to choose and why.
I like swimming and photography because it will be very interesting to improve my skills at both activities.
The last thing I would like to know is what clothes I have to take, even though the weather in July will be good.
Almost all of us like shopping! Going in and out of the shops, buying clothes, food and presents, but few of us are very happy to spend money.
Money is a very important thing for shopping.
If you have money, it is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagine that your credit card is not working, or some one stole your cash from your pocket.
We will say you're unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation.
Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapped.
Staying in a queue or crowd is also unpleasant.
All the people are shouting, stepping on your feet and it is very likely that you won't get the product you need.
Afterwards you are tired and have no energy to do things.
After all the things that I have mentioned it is clear that shopping is not enjoyable.
I have received the letter you have sent me.
I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me in the letter.
First, I would like to travel in July, because I am a university student and I have only one month of summer vacation, that is in July.
I would appreciate it if it was the first two weeks of the month.
Next, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I need to have a time to relax when I travel.
Therefore, I would prefer a log cabin.
For activities, my first choice is basketball.
I have been playing it since I was nine years old.
In high school, I was in a school team and I enjoyed playing it with my team mate, even though we were not a strong team.
My second choice is golf.
I had never played it until last month.
However, I could enjoy it, even though I was a beginner, so I would like to practise and have fun at the camp.
I got your letter yesterday.
I enjoyed reading how you spent time with your family and had fun at the Park.
Thank you.
As I have told you, I had a chance to help at a concert of Majesty, a local band in which one of my friends played guitar.
He knew that I'd wanted to work at a concert hall, possibly as a lighting technician.
So he suggested me to help at their concert so that I could know behind the scenes.
When I arrived there, the staff were already busy.
At first I just helped setting up the stage; setting microphones, and tuning guitars.
When I was doing it, one of the staff called me and took me to a room.
He explained to me that it was to control the light.
It was fun practising how to move the lights and change the lights.
However, when it came to the real concert, it was very hard.
I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only in July because I just started my new job and I have one month of holiday, which is in July.
You wrote to me that I can choose my accommodation.
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I have a problem with my back.
It is the reason that I can't lie on the ground.
Beside that, I'm allergic, and that causes me problems when I'm close to nature.
You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can choose.
I'm quite good at painting and I play tennis.
I'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints, canvas and brushes for me.
The size of the canvas isn't so important.
I have my own sports equipment to play tennis.
I hope I'll have a possibility to improve my ability in it.
I'm champion of my town, so I think I can find a suitable person who can play with me.
Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather you have at this time of the year.
Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite Polish group "THE CULT" in Warshaw.
I had the chance to help at the concert.
You can't imagine how happy I was.
I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot.
You know I'm good at make-up and I have done scenography many times.
They were pleased that I can do two of these jobs, that's why I got the job.
I was working like crazy but I enjoyed it a lot.
I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they gave the concert.
Could you believe that two nights I was cutting paper flowers, grass, the sun and thousands of birds.
I didn't have many people who were helping me, that's why I was working 48 hours without stopping.
I think the result of that action was marvellous.
Everybody was very surprised that you can create such amazing things, using scissors and paper.
I liked the mountains which I made a lot.
From a distance they looked very real.
I just  paper and I painted on the top.
In front of the stage I put the grass and a lot of flowers.
The light on the stage was very bright and very warm which made the scenery very pleasant.
After that I prepared the group.
I did their make-up for them.
I was very happy because during this time I had a chance to talk to them and to find out more about them.
They are very nice people.
Even Audrey who seems very stupid.
She is very intelligent.
I really don't know why she behaves so badly during her interview.
I got their address so we can visit them one day.
I told them about you and they said we are very welcome any time.
I told them you are full of life and they are your favourite Polish group.
They would like to know you a lot.
We'll speak about it when I come to see you.
I am really excited to travel to Camp California in the USA because I like to get to know people from other countries.
As I only have holidays in July I would like to travel in this month.
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I like to be comfortable and I don't like to lie down on the floor inside a tent.
I would like to play basketball because I love this game.
I used to play when I was at high school.
I think that I am a very competitive player, as well as a good technical player.
Also I would like to do swimming.
I think that I am a very fast swimmer but I don't have good style or technique.
I have been helping to organise a pop concert in Dublin.
As you know I love Irish music so I was very happy when the organisers of the concert phoned me to help them.
The organisers paid for my accommodation and flight to Ireland.
I arrived in Ireland on 2nd July.
On my first day I didn't work.
On the next day I helped them to build the scenery and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening.
On my third day I helped them to install the sound system.
While we were installing the sound system we listened to Irish music and suddenly we saw U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us.
I could speak to my favourite singer 'Bono'.
I could meet him and I helped him to repair his guitar because it didn't sound very good.
For the remaining days I wasn't doing anything special, I just helped to organise the rehearsals of the different groups who were going to play in the concert.
I would like to travel in July I'll have to finish my exams.
The last of them will be on the 30th of .
I'd like to play golf and tennis.
I have played both since I was young, and I like them, but I don't have enough time to play, and my level isn't as good as I'd like.
In order to know what sort of clothes I have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period? I'm not used to high temperatures.
I don't like the hot weather so much.
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes.
Our school is now the best in the country in all ages.
We are with this.
We can show what we do in order to be the best.
If it is possible we can conduct an interview with the last winner.
It would be good to show the swimming pool, the gym, etc.
We can also show one of the youngest classes and at the end one of the oldest.
This way, the people who see the video will see the progress of our students.
At the end of the video we can show all the students and all the teachers in front of the main building like an old photo.
I am very glad to have received your letter, and very happy to have won first prize in your competition.
I am writing to answer your question and ask for further information.
First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four weeks' vacation in July.
I would like to travel in July.
Secondly, for me, the best way to live in the outdoors is in tents, because that is a good chance to acquire a lot of knowledge about the planets and the animals as well.
Moreover, I am good at playing basketball.
In fact, I am the captain in the basketball team, which is one of the best teenage teams in my city, and I also like singing.
I play piano very well.
Two of my friends and I have a band.
We sometimes perform in my school club.
Could you tell me something about the clothes and money which I need to take with me.
Introduction: The aim of this report is to summarize the right lessons and activities to be filmed.
Music is a traditional subject in our school.
Everyone in our school can play at least one instrument, so music lessons should be filmed to show music is part of our school's daily life.
According to a survey which has been conducted by other students, every student in our school has one maths class every day.
So, maths lessons should be filmed.
Our school basketball team is one of the best teenage teams in our city, and every afternoon students are all playing basketball in the playground.
So, basketball should be filmed.
To sum up, music class, maths class and students playing basketball.
I am writing to find out further information and give you some details about myself and the trip that I have won in your competition.
First of all, I would like to inform you that I am able to travel only in July because I am a student and in June, I will still have school.
Also, in August I will be studying a summer course in English.
In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and everyday comforts, during these two weeks.
However, in your letter you mentioned some activities.
I would choose Basketball and Tennis.
I have been playing basketball in a team in my town for ten years.
Also tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice a week with my friends.
How are you? I am very well.
I'm writing to tell you about my experience with the pop concert last month.
First of all, I think that I helped them.
Every day of that month I was trying to advertise this concert.
I was going to markets and to schools and I was giving out information about when and where the group was going to appear as well as where people could buy or book a ticket for this concert.
I know it was difficult and tiring but I enjoyed it a lot.
Firstly, it was a good break from the usual routine because I was doing it for the first time.
Also, I felt wonderful when I saw that the concert was a success and every day it was because I believed that this was a result which came about with my help.
I would like to do it again in the future.
It was a fantastic experience.
Thank you for your letter and congratulations! I have always been interested in visiting other countries.
In fact I didn't want to ask my parents for money, and going on holiday with you is an ideal solution.
As regards accommodation, I would like to stay in tents, because I used to go on holiday with my friends and stay in tents.
It is just wonderful.
As requested, I have collected some information about the school.
Below is a summary of the most important relevant points with some recommendations.
1.
The fully equipped computer centre in the main building is extremely good.
Lessons are very interesting and full of fun.
Our teacher is friendly and he encourages us to study well.
However, there are not enough computers and sometimes we have to study in pairs.
I suggest increasing the number of them, because it will be more exciting to film.
2.
The school arranges an amazing range of activities, such as excursions, sports and different kinds of trips.
Although there is plenty for us to do during the day, the funniest events happen while we are playing basketball and football.
I must say, I think this is the best time for making a short video.
I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written in it.
First of all, I would like to travel only in the month of July, because during the month of June I'm going to work and in September I have to study a lot, because school will start .
Regarding accommodation, between tents and log cabins, I would prefer a tent, because I love adventure and also because I can be freer.
I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have chosen two from your list: basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been part of a strong team for three years.
I was so surprised and delighted as well to receive from you such wonderful news! Thank God, you made me really happy.
From your letter I was pleased to learn that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for.
But could you, please, let me have more details about my prize.
What kind of people will be invited to your Camp this summer? I would like to know with whom I'll share such wonderful days sports activities.
About sport...
I must be honest: I'm not very keen on sport.
But I will be glad to go swimming and sailing for a few weeks.
I have been learning to paint.
And I would prefer to have a nice audience for my poetry as well.
I'm a poet, .
I would choose the month of July, because I'm free at this time from family duties.
About the other camp conditions - it does not matter for me.
I can stay in tents or log cabins, whatever you wish.
Send me, please, news about July.
You know, Kim, I'm always looking for an aim in life.
Not only - to LIVE, but to have something to LIVE FOR.
Now I have made my choice.
P.S.
Your present, a small toy, a white - I always keep with me, it helps me to pass my exams.
I am writing about the letter that I recently received from you, which is about a competition in which I have won the first prize.
I would like to know if it is possible for me to go in July, because I have school in the other months, and it is impossible for me to go in December or January.
About the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent, because it is safer and more comfortable.
The two activities that I prefer are Basketball, because I played in my school's team for almost a year, and Photography, which is a hobby that I am good at and I have done since I was ten.
On top of everything, I would like to ask how much money I should take, and what type of clothes are the best to wear in the competition.
If you are used to going Shopping very often, maybe it is because you don't know about all the other good things you can do on your weekend.
People are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar.
It is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
On the other hand, everything at the shopping centre is more expensive, because the people that shop there usually don't compare prices or look for cheaper shops, because all they need is already at this place.
Instead of going to the theatre, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at Ikurapiura park, people prefer spending all their money at shopping centres.
So, why don't we try to change our habits and start to do new things to enjoy ourselves.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I am glad to be informed that I have won first prize in your competition.
I am now writing this letter to give you further information about myself .
Firstly, the date I would like to travel on would only be in July.
Since I am a full-time student, I will not have finished my lessons until the end of June.
In addition, I will be busy with my course work in August.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents because I think it will be closer to nature.
I am sure I will have a lot of fun and release myself from totally.
I am pretty good at painting.
I have won several prizes in the competitions which were held by my college.
On the other hand, I started to play tennis at the age of six.
Tennis is my favourite sport.
So I would like to do these two activities while I am at the Camp.
Shopping is becoming a popular way of killing time nowadays.
In some people's opinion, shopping and spending money is a kind of amusement and they can even get satisfaction from it.
I could only travel in the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th.
The accommodation that best suits me is the log cabin, as the space in tents is very limited and I am not used to having all my belongings in order and packed at all times.
With regard to the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose from such a huge variety, but I prefer to do those I know better such as climbing.
I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practising new techniques and taking pictures of new landscapes.
Please send me a list of the items I may need there, including the most appropriate clothes for the American weather.
I would also like to know in advance the amount of money I need to bring for expenses that will not be included.
There are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.
And whenever money is involved, some problems are likely to arise.
Thieves will try to put their hands in our wallets and purses, and even the so-called 'plastic money' is not always safe.
Hunting on the high street, or the shopping malls for the desired bargain - because we can't afford to buy anything otherwise - often becomes a desperate attempt to attain a lifestyle promoted by the new consumerist society.
And nobody can say they would rather go back to the stone age when money was not even invented.
With more free time and more money to spend than ever, shopping is a great activity, but when this creates bad habits such as overspending, it could lead to serious problems.
In the end everything depends on our attitude to life, including shopping.
I particularly enjoy making lists of the products before going shopping.
But even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
I have seen your letter about Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now.
First of all, you state in the letter that the accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like being in contact with nature .
Secondly, from the list of activities that you provide in the letter I would prefer swimming because when I was a child I did this sport for 8 years.
In addition, I would prefer photography too because I love taking photos.
Finally, I would be grateful if you could clarify what kind of clothes I must take and how much I will spend during the stay at the Camp.
Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help at the event.
First I didn't accept but finally she convinced me.
It was the most exciting experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drink.
I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepared orange juices.
It was great because I got to know a lot of people and the most important person was Alex, the drummer of the group.
You know he is my love! He's good looking.
I enjoyed very much.
I only have two months of vacation in July and August and since I must visit my grandparents in August, the only time possible is July.
Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money on yourself or people you like is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.
You often enter a shop and see people everywhere so you have to squeeze yourself through the aisles to take a look at a product.
After long hours of hesitation, you decide to buy a product but discover that it is overpriced.
Frustrated, you nevertheless pick something cheaper and advance towards the cashiers.
There, you find an enormous queue waiting for you but you still have to stand up even though your tired legs demand a seat.
It is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the money over to the cashier.
Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but, unfortunately, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for.
Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting in more frustration and tiredness.
In the first place, I prefer to travel in July because my school will not be closed before this date.
Secondly, a camping holiday has always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming.
When I was in primary school, I was one of the members of the school swimming team.
I am not really good at basketball but I think it is good fun.
For these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which I was given.
I was really happy when your letter arrived and I learned that I won the first prize in your competition.
I have never been to the U.S.A.
Now I will give you the information which you asked for.
It is only possible for me to travel in July.
That is the only month when I have time because after July I have to start at university.
You wrote that I should choose two activities.
I have chosen golf because I have been playing golf since 1998 and I want to improve and then I decided to start a new kind of sport and I would like to start climbing.
I could play golf in the first week and in the second I could start climbing.
I think it depends if you are a man or a woman and now I have to say I am a woman and I enjoy it.
Honestly I never had a shopping trip alone which I didn't enjoy.
I can remember one shopping trip which I went on with a man and it was a nightmare.
It was a fantastic sunny day and we went to Frankfurt and I really needed shoes and it is not easy to buy shoes .
You have to choose carefully.
I tried ten pairs of shoes and with every shoe his mood got worse and worse and in the end we had a big fight about everything.
We left the shop without any shoes, in a horrible mood and we went home.
Now he is my ex-boyfriend! Two days later I went back to the shop and I bought the shoes, which I still wear.
This was for me the only shopping trip which was not enjoyable.
To sum up, my advice is that women should go alone or with a female friend.
I have received your letter today and I would like to thank you for the first prize.
The best dates for me to travel would be in July because I work in the communications industry and I must ask my employer when I can take holidays.
But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000.
Regarding the accommodation at camp, I prefer the log cabins, because a few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet.
So for this reason, I choose the log cabins.
.
I am in the swimming team and I must go two times per week to train because I have a competition every weekend.
My second choice is basketball.
I have played basketball at school and I was one of the best players.
After that, I decided to coach a team but I should stop because I have started entering swimming competitions.
You know last month I helped at a pop concert as part of the security.
It was a very good experience.
The concert sarted at 6:00 pm until 2:00 am, and I started to work at 12:00 pm to prepare the stage with the musicians.
After that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, I was at the entrance to take the tickets and, you know, it was incredible because some people slept all night in front of the stadium to be in the front row.
There were maybe 50,000 spectators for this show.
It was amazing.
When the concert started I had if anybody threw bottles or anything else on the stage.
I also helped to serve people who would like to drink.
I was like a barman.
I saw old people, children....
and for me it was very strange and it was very interesting, because I met a lot of people and the best thing was that I knew the pop group who sang.
It was fantastic.
If I have another opportunity to do that I think that I will do.
First of all, I would like to express my joy at having won this prize.
I am very happy.
Secondly, you would like to know when I will be able to go there.
Actually, I have asked my boss and he has given me two weeks off in July.
We have a lot to do at work so it is not easy to get weeks off.
Thirdly, I prefer staying in a tent to staying in a log cabin.
I think it is more fun.
Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing.
I am very good at tennis.
Last year, I took part in a competition and I did well.
I also have a sailing licence but I have not done it for a long time.
I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me.
I do not know if things are expensive there.
Therefore, could you give me an idea of how much money I should bring with me.
I am looking forward to receiving more information.
It is Saturday.
The the supermarket car park is full.
There are no more shopping trolleys.
All the shops are crowded.
Some people are in a hurry, others are aggressive and most of the others are very stressed.
It is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainment not only for teenagers but also for adults.
We have more and more shops everywhere and they sell everything.
Because of that, people's needs have increased a lot nowadays.
That is also the reason why we have all these new supermarkets.
On the one hand, it is very enjoyable to go shopping because we can find a lot of things.
Sometimes we need them and sometimes we don't but it is fun to buy new clothes, furniture and so on.
On the other hand, the quality of service in the shops and supermarkets has deteriorated a lot these last few years.
The shop assistants are not always nice and sometimes they don't even know anything about what they sell.
In my opinion, shopping is not always enjoyable, especially when there are too many people in the shops.
Thanks for your letter.
I am very happy about the news.
Also to know about the all accommodation and travel costs that are included in the first prize.
I am going to give you all the information that you need.
I would like to travel only in July because I am free from college and also it is a very good time for me.
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in a tent, because I have had a very nice experience in a tent and I love to share with other people.
In addition I would like to choose singing and photography because I am good at singing and taking photographs.
I hope you and your family are fine.
I am going to answer your letter just now.
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert a lot.
Really it was a very interesting experience, particularly when I had to deal with a young group of children from Latin America.
It was incredible, because I learnt some Spanish words such as Hello, How are you? goodbye, What is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc.
I am very happy that I promised myself that I would learn Spanish this Summer at Huntingdon College.
Also another interesting thing was learning about their culture, because all of them come from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile or Uruguay.
At the concert they were very successful because they were very confident and I helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
I hope one day you and I can travel to South America because I would like to introduce you to my new friends.
I am writing this letter because I would like to express my happiness.
This is the first time I won a prize in this kind of competition so I would like to answer your questions.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have a lot of work to do and my parents wish to see me this month, so if it is possible to arrange the dates that would be very nice.
Second, I used to go to Camps where they only used log cabins so I prefer, if it is possible, to be in a tent, because it would be a new experience for me.
Third, I love playing basketball.
I am a great player and I play for my University and I like to be playing all the time so I will not miss this activity.
The other activity would be surfing.
I think it is very cool and I want to learn.
Finally, I want to know what kind of clothing I will need and if have to take any money to spend at the shops or markets.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
You have to be walking all the time, so your legs will feel painful at the end of the day.
You will be very tired and you will want to rest for two months.
If I go alone it is very fast and I enjoy it but if I went with my mother it would be horrible, I would have to make a sacrifice.
I would have to wait until my mother decided which is the best place to buy her dress.
She would see if it is pretty or not, if it is on sale at another store, we would not buy the dress and we would have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but after seeing all the stores and looking at all the dresses she would decide on the first one we saw.
It would be horrible.
It is like a nightmare.
I am very pleased to hear that I have won first prize in your competition and am writing to you to offer additional information, as requested.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I am planning to visit my Mum in Korea in August.
I also prefer staying in log cabins to tents.
I have once experienced having been soaked while I was sleeping in a tent due to heavy rain several years ago.
One more reason is that I do not want to miss the chance to stay in a log cabin, which I have been dreaming of for a long time.
How romantic it will be! As for my activities, as I took up playing golf when I was a child and now, I am a single-handicapped player, so I want to have a chance to play golf at camp.
Moreover, I am very good at singing as well as playing the piano.
In fact I have been playing the piano for a children's choir for 5 years.
I would be really grateful if you could send me some information or any relevant brochure.
How are things these days? Sorry not to write to you for a long time.
I've been busy preparing for English exams.
You remember I helped people at a pop concert as a nurse last month? You can't imagine how happy I am to have had such a wonderful opportunity.
I hope you can go to the next concert with me.
Longing to hear from you.
 I am writing in reply to your letter of the 15th of May.
I would like to provide some further information you are asking me for.
First, I am only able to come in July, because my examination session is due from the 24 June till 26 June.
I would prefer to be accommodated in a log cabin as I do not like sleeping on a mattress and I get an allergy to rubber.
From the listed activities I would like to choose singing, because it is my hobby and I also sing in a local choir.
Photography is my second favourite subject.
I won third prize in a competition organized by our college.
Could you, please send me some extra information regarding the amount of money I should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes I should take.
I like shopping very much.
Firstly, you have a wide variety of shops you can buy food from.
For example, large supermarkets with dishes ready to eat.
Even if you do not have any cooking skills you can enjoy exotic meals.
On the other hand, some people complain that there are a lot of artificial products, which are quite unhealthy, but very expensive.
The second thing I like about shopping is the possibility to find your own style by buying clothes in the small boutiques.
You can always ask for good advice from the experienced shop assistants, which does not necessarily cost you extra money.
However, someone else may say, it takes too much time.
To sum up, I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable, but for me it is and I like it.
About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free to travel because I won't have classes at school by that time.
As to the matter of accommodation I'd prefer a log cabin, because I consider them better for resting and getting to know people.
I have something I'd like to ask you.
Do I have to take any special clothes with me? How warm is California in that month? Another thing, should I take my camera with me for the activity at the Camp? I'd appreciate any further information you can give me.
Looking forward to your reply.
Thank you for the letter which I have received with great delight and excitement.
I am writing in order to let you know about the further necessary information you have requested.
Before I go to the Camp, I would like to know what type of clothes I need to take and whether there is anything I should take in case of any emergencies.
Also the amount of money I need to bring (are there any shops).
And finally, I would like to ask you to send me some pictures of the place as I am dying to know what it is like.
Thank you.
I was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
The organiser of the concert asked my school for about 15 people, who do art, to help decorate the stage.
Me and my friends were very excited, not because of the stage decoration but because of the pop singers and bands whom we would be able to see! Everyone was so jealous in the school.
When we got there, there were very many people.
People were carrying big boxes around which contained electrical equipment for the concert.
We were all given different sorts of jobs to do.
Some of us had to paint and some of us had to cut some materials and fabrics out into special shapes.
It was very interesting and we enjoyed doing it very much.
However the best part was watching and listening to the singers and bands practising on the stage.
At the end we were given free concert tickets and got autographs from our favourite pop singers.
It was the best day of my life and certainly for others, too.
I wish you had been there.
It was fantastic.
I will be looking forward to your reply.
Thanks for your letter.
I am so excited that I have won the first prize.
I will give you all the information you need and ask some questions.
I can only travel in July.
As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is the summer holiday.
But I have booked a flight home at the beginning of August.
And also I would like to go in summer.
The accommodation, I would like to stay in tents, because I have never stayed in a tent before.
I think it will be great and I want to try it.
I like doing sports.
I would like to play basketball and golf when I am at the Camp.
I play basketball a lot and I am a member of our college team.
But I am not very good at golf.
And also I want to ask some questions.
What clothes should I take? How much money should I take? And how can we meet at the airport? I am looking forward to your reply.
As our class is going to make a short video about daily life at college, I am writing this report to suggest some lessons and activities which should be filmed.
1.
English lesson.
Because students in the English class are from all over the world, we can talk about everybody's feelings about living and studying in a foreign country.
2.
Computing lesson and computer room.
Nowadays the Internet brings us closer and closer.
We can get all we want on the Internet.
It's one of the most important things in our life now.
3.
Library.
We not only borrow books from a library but also study at a library.
The library is very important in our daily life.
4.
Canteen.
Every day we go to the canteen to have lunch, no matter whether you buy food from there or you take your own food.
5.
Football.
What do you do after class? Jogging or some sports? You can't forget football.
This is what I think should be filmed.
If any of you have other suggestions, we can discuss this again.
But I think these five lessons or activities are the most common in our daily life at college.
I prefer to travel in July because I am taking some important exams in September and I have planned to study in August.
With reference to the accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I think it is the best way to socialize.
Concerning the activities, I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me.
I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses.
On the other hand I have never taken a course in climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby.
I would like to ask you something about the weather and clothes I should bring so as not to have to buy anything there.
In addition I need to know whether meals are included or not with the accommodation so that I can decide how much I must have with me.
As you know, Luna Pop is not my favourite group and I went to their concert only because Ake needed to be accompanied.
When we arrived she persuaded me to go backstage because her boyfriend was the band's electrician.
It didn't sound very exciting to me but I accepted anyway because I was curious.
Unfortunately what I found wasn't what I expected.
Everyone was upset, worried or angry and Lucre, Ake's boyfriend, explained that it was because their pianist had broken his arm and couldn't play.
Just then Ake exclaimed that I could play the piano.
After that I tried to tell them I had just begun to learn but within five minutes I was on the stage and I was playing that, luckily, easy tune.
I don't think you can believe what I've told you but I won't forget this experience.
This has been the first time I have realized that, maybe, playing the piano could be my future and, even though I was really frightened, I enjoyed being on the stage with all those eyes on me.
1.
- I would prefer a log cabin rather than a tent, because it is much more comfortable.
2.
- I have chosen singing and painting as activities, because I love painting, moreover, I am very good at it, and singing because it is one of my talents.
Thanks in advance for your advice.
I am writing to you to tell you what an impressive experience I have had helping at a pop concert.
I will start by telling you how crowded it was, people were so excited that they were screaming from the beginning to the end.
I couldn't even hear my own voice.
I cleared the stage before the concert, but you can't imagine what it looked like after it?!!! full of flowers, T-shirts, hats, underwear, etc etc etc.
I couldn't feel my feet the next day, I was very tired.!! Anyway, I also laughed a lot, the music was fantastic, and the stars were really nice to everyone.
In reference to your activities option, I would say that climbing is one of my first options, as I've mentioned, and I really think that photography will help me in my other adventures.
I would like to ask if we need any money to pay for or buy anything because you didn't specify what is included in the trip, such as food.
I really appreciate this kind of trip and I'm really grateful for your attention.
Shopping...
a great and emotional statement, don't you think? Everyone thinks that shopping is the best way to get rid of your problems and, in fact a big solution to many problems or , boring, or only for distraction.
But the question is: why is shopping not always enjoyable? For many people, shopping has always been only for one kind of elite, or social class; not all people can go shopping and buy hundreds and thousands of things in those big malls as a distraction.
Let's talk about women; nightmare! Women can't resist the temptation of shopping and they are disappointed when they don't have the desire to shop.
There are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
I am writing to reply to your letter and communicate my acceptance of the first prize in your Competition.
This summer, I am available in July because in August my family and I are going to go to Canada and in September I will go back to university.
If there is no chance to go to California in July, I could wait until next summer.
About accommodation, I would like to have a log cabin because last year I had an accident and my back was injured, so sleeping in a tent would be painful for me.
I play basketball at university and my standard is quite good but what I am really enjoying is being a referee.
Due to my back injury, this year I could not train and play with my team, so I am not fit.
It would be a good idea to be a referee.
I would like to swim everyday if it is possible.
Although swimming is so boring, it would be a good thing to help cure my back.
It was brilliant! I had the best month of my life.
It was a hard month because my job was very hard.
I worked 12 hours per day but always with fun people.
My job was cleaning the floor after the concert; "it was very dirty".
It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course.
I didn't have to pay to get in.
I fell in love with a beautiful girl "Calen".
She is from Spain and was selling "hot dogs".
She will come to Liverpool next week and I'll put her up.
Probably she'll come with a friend and if you want you can join us.
Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've met new friends and I know that at the concert there aren't any drunks just fun, wonderful people.
I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help with "Doctor Meesee", which is the best concert in the world.
I hope you will come there.
You have to save up some money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..).
First of all, I'd like to thank you for the prize I won.
I'd like to get to know the USA.
This prize came at a good time.
I'd like to travel in July because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July.
For this the only month that I can travel is July.
And I'd like to stay in a log cabin because I can't bear sleeping in a tent.
I hate that kind of accommodation.
But I love sports.
I'd like to play tennis and go swimming.
These are my favourite sports.
I can play tennis better you I can swim, because since I was a child I've been playing it.
I've already won three prizes in it.
And I'd like to know what kind of clothes to take and how much money to take too.
I've never been to the USA before.
We had a class discussion about shopping, because of it I'm writing to explain about my opinion.
I love shopping mainly when I am alone or when I am angry because I think it can help me to relax.
When I have got plenty of money sometimes I like to spend a bit of it with some friends or buying a good present for my girlfriend.
But if I haven't got enough money to spend or if I am sad shopping is not always enjoyable, because without money and being sad it is not a good idea to go shopping.
Normally I spend money buying some new clothes that I like and shoes.
I love new shoes.
One good idea is to go shopping when you have got plenty of money.
I have recently received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition.
It was very fortunate for me.
I would like to go to Camp California in the USA only in July as it is my summer holidays then.
It will be convenient for me then because I have two months' holiday.
I would like to do Tennis and Photography.
I am in the tennis team at school and I have played against various other schools before.
I also enjoy photography.
I am doing this subject for my G.C.S.E.s so it would be very helpful for me to practise.
About the accommodation at the Camp, I would like to stay in tents because I love to be outside and I like dangerous adventures.
I can also then wake up in the morning and take photographs of the wonderful scenery.
I would like to ask you about what kind of clothes I have to bring and how much money I have to bring.
Will there be any shops? Please could you send me an itinerary of the trip? Thank you very much.
I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropriate time! Not only are shops crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queues.
The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size.
These things can be very annoying but there is a good side to 'shopping'.
I, personally, enjoy shopping very much.
I like to look at the beautiful clothes and I dream of wearing them.
I find that shopping is very good exercise as well! By the time you have completed the whole High Street, you will be out of breath.
I've received your letter and I'm very happy to know that I won the competition and the first prize.
In answer to your question, I will have to say that I can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only gave me that month off.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
We have all been shopping once in our lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? We had a class discussion and we all agree on some points.
For example, if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we are looking for, and instead of buying what we came for we will leave with lots of things that we liked but we will never use.
And that will be a waste of time.
Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and that is when the problems begin.
Most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc...
And when this happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
So if you want to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really want.
Thank you for your information.
I am very happy to win this prize but also I have some questions about the camp.
I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this camp in July because for me it is the best time and I cannot travel before or after , according to my employer.
During these two weeks I would like to stay in a tent because you can be nearer to nature than you are in a log cabin.
I like to go camping.
From the activities, I choose basketball and golf.
I am very good at basketball, because I have played in a basketball team for ten years.
But at golf I am a beginner.
I would like to know if it is necessary for me to take some clothes with me for the sports activities? Also I would like to know how much money I should take with me.
If you could tell me the answers it would be very nice.
I think shopping is not always an enjoyable thing because there are a lot of things which are not good about it.
For example: you need a lot of money each month for shopping, and a part of this money is only for buying the most necessary things like bread and other things to eat.
I enjoy shopping when I can buy some clothes.
Also a problem with shopping is that most of the time there are too many people and a lot of traffic in all the shopping centres.
All the people are there mostly on the same day because there are not a lot of other opportunities for shopping during the week for workers.
I think one alternative is to buy your things on the Internet, because then you don't have to invest a lot of time buying all these things, and they bring you the things to your home.
In the end I think it is best if you have the chance to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.
I am so amazed about winning the competition.
I am .
Firstly, I am able to travel only in July because I will be on holiday in July, furthermore I have an important exam in November.
Secondly I would prefer to stay in a tent as it will be natural life while I am at the Camp.
Thirdly I am keen on playing tennis and taking some photographs.
In spite of the fact that the weather is bad, I play tennis.
I collect strange photographs by myself.
Finally, I am wondering how much money I need for myself and what kind of clothes I need.
I like speaking activity while I am in the class.
During that time I can talk about some secret or private things with classmates.
After that we know each other better than before.
In addition speaking activity includes everything for learning English such as listening, speaking, and grammar as well.
Other lessons, the teacher teaches lots of things which are grammar, English culture...
etc.
It might be good.
However, all the students are passive.
So it can be boring.
Give a topic and then discuss it.
I know what my friends think and like.
.
Also the film must be funny.
If a film is boring, nobody will watch it.
During speaking, there are lots of things happening such as, some students can't understand what the other students say and their culture.
Having fun and acquiring new knowledge.
It makes us laugh.
So I think that speaking activity should be filmed as you can see and know the real us and it would be funny as well.
I am writing in reply to your letter that I have just received.
I am very happy to win first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am also very excited about it.
If it is possible, I would like to travel in July.
This is the only month that I will be free because I am studying Management and Finance at university and it will finish at the end of June.
I will be in Italy in August because I need to improve my Italian as I am taking a very important exam next year.
I would appreciate it if I could stay in a tent at the Camp because I usually go on camping holidays with my friends.
It is great fun.
I really like sleeping in tents.
You also said in your letter that we will have the chance to do two activities.
I am really good at playing tennis and singing.
I have been playing tennis for five years and I love it.
I play the classical guitar and I also sing .
I have been playing the classical guitar for three years.
It is quite difficult but I like difficult things.
I wonder if you could tell me about the weather and what kind of clothes I ought to bring with me.
I would also like to know how much money I need.
Why do people like shopping? The first answer is that they need to go shopping.
The second answer is that shopping makes everyone happy.
If I get bored I can't stay at home and I feel like going shopping.
When I go shopping I don't think about any problems I have.
It's very relaxing for me but only if it is possible to do the shopping.
Sometimes it can be nightmare if you can't find something that you are looking for.
I think the weekends are not the right time to go shopping.
I went shopping last week with my friend, she needed to buy a nightdress.
We spent three hours and we couldn't buy anything.
It was incredibly crowded.
We couldn't even move and most people were just looking and wasting their time.
If you are in a hurry, don't go shopping! It is not really a good idea to go shopping if you don't have enough time.
Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them.
I can tell you how bad a situation you are in because when I was a child I always had arguments with my mother about shopping.
I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried.
It was very shameful for my mum.
She was also very angry because she never managed to get me out of the toy shop.
As you see, shopping is not always enjoyable.
Always make sure that it is the right time to go shopping.
Thank you for your letter.
It was a wonderful surprise! I'm writing to give you the information you requested.
Firstly, you asked me when I'd prefer to travel.
For me, the only option is July, because I've already something planned in August.
Firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of apartheid.
The political and historical background is very interesting, but also complicated.
I think that you can't understand all the links between the events without reading the book more than once.
And by understanding the book, you'll also be able to better understand what happens nowadays in a lot of countries.
However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko.
Both of them symbolize courage, the love of justice, the fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes.
Just like the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has legends, and "Cry Freedom" is one of them.
I am writing to reply to your letter.
I'm very glad to hear that I have won first prize in your competition.
Here is the information you require.
First of all, I'm available to travel only in July because in August I'm going to attend a language course in France.
As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable, and, therefore, I have never stayed in a tent.
I play basketball very well, although I have never taken part in important competitions; however, I am not very good at tennis, and I would like to improve .
Moreover I would be grateful if you could tell me how much money I have to take, and what clothes are best to wear during the holiday.
This report shows which lessons and activities are best to film in order to make a short video about daily life at our school.
It is based on interviews taken from over 80% of my classmates.
First of all, according to the majority of them, Latin and Greek lessons should be filmed.
In fact they find it difficult to take them in and, in their opinion, these lessons are the most important so as to show their daily life at school.
On the other hand, about 3% of students suggest that chemistry lessons should also be filmed, because they often take place in the laboratory that the school has recently built; in fact some experiments might be filmed.
Furthermore, some students would like to film the school football team, because football is the most activity among the students.
To sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern their sports activities as well.
Firstly, I would like to say that I am surprised to receive a letter from you.
I read the information you gave to me.
It is very interesting.
It is very good .
Regarding Camp California in the U.S.A., I expect to travel in July because I will have a long holiday at that time and my children have to go to France with school in July as well.
I think it will be a very good time to travel without worries.
When I arrive there, I would like to do painting and take a photography course because both of these are my hobbies.
I have been doing a lot of them when I have had some free time and when I feel impressed with where I have been.
I think I can do these things very well.
Finally I would like to ask you about and how the weather is over there in July because I will pack the .
By the way I have to say thank you very much for everything that you are offering me and I look forward to further information from you.
How are you? It has been a very long time since I wrote a letter to you.
I hope you will feel better when you have finished my letter.
Today I am going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert I went to last month.
I have got a lot of things to talk about.
Firstly about the hall which they used for the concert.
It was a very big hall, a sound system and .
It was brilliant.
Secondly the superstars that came to perform at the concert.
They were very cool.
By the way, I did a lot of things at that concert.
I had to people who were responsible for ticket.
They had to check when people came in the hall and I was checking the tickets as well.
You know, you have to when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they try to go through very quickly.
So you have to explain a lot of times to make people calm down and stand in a row.
It was very hard for me and I won't do it again.
 if you want to go there.
- concerning the date: I can go in July because it's my holiday month.
That was what my boss told me.
- Activities: I am very keen on surfing because, where I live, I can do it every day.
I also want to "book in" singing because I love singing very much and I am always singing in my house.
Thank you so much for your concern.
Why don't you buy the green one? Oh, no! That's horrible, mum! This is a normal scene when a mother and her daughter are shopping and getting clothes from the shelves.
That is what most women love.
They love going to a shopping centre and putting lots of clothes on.
That's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are many problems.
First of all, a big problem is the children.
When they go shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that they see: doors, little cars, films...
but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, then the children are crying because they are tired from shopping all day.
Also there is a big problem: the money.
People buy and buy unnecessary things but, when they get home, they can see an empty wallet.
I would like to assure you that I will do my best to be one of the winners in your competition.
Now, I would like to provide some of the information that you may need.
Firstly, I have to say that I can only travel in July this year.
This is mostly because I have a job and I have made further arrangements for the other summer months.
Secondly, I would be very grateful if you could accommodate me in tents rather than log cabins.
It is mostly because I like fresh air at night.
From the list of activities in which I will have a chance to compete I have chosen basketball and swimming.
I am very good at those kinds of sports and think that I could be the winner.
Finally, I would like to ask you how many clothes and how much money I should take with me.
I will wait to hear from you, soon.
In the first place, I would like to point out that to go shopping does not always mean to buy something.
A lot of people, especially women, go to do their shopping only for fun.
In such a situation they are looking for something that they might buy.
But, what about real shopping? I mean shopping with a real purpose.
For example, imagine that you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit.
It's a real nightmare when you try to match everything: from the size, the colour to the of the suit that is acceptable for everyone.
To sum up, I would like to say that shopping is enjoyable when you are going only for fun.
But, when you want to buy something special it's a real nightmare.
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July.
I wonder if it is all right to come at that time.
And concerning my accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable.
I would like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere in which I will be living .
I like to do some activities in water and my favourite activity is swimming.
Before I came to England, I swam every weekend in my country, even in winter, so I choose to do some swimming and sailing while I am at the camp.
Actually, my mind has already gone there.
I can't wait even for a minute.
I want to go there now.
.
Lots of students normally have classes in the morning.
And sometimes they do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon.
For instance, reading, looking for some information or using the computer.
The arts students want to learn another foreign language.
Moreover, some foreign students hope there will be some English classes that focus on the examination.
Start some part-time foreign language classes for the students who are interested in them.
Let foreign students do more exercises about English to help them pass the exam.
Use the equipment and space that we have to organise some activities.
Thank you for your informative letter and your congratulations.
I was really delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize.
I'm really looking forward to it as I've never been to the U.S.A.
before.
Unfortunately, the only month I can travel is July because I'm doing my final exams at university in June and then starting a job in August.
Any two weeks during July will suit me perfectly.
The best time would be from 17th July till 30th July.
As for accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a tent.
I'm used to sleeping in a tent from my previous holidays and I always enjoyed it.
I'd just like to know if the tents at the camp are and how many people are there in one tent.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you again.
In my last letter I promised to write to you about my experience working at a pop-concert.
The job came unexpectedly as my friend, who was supposed to work there, broke her leg just two days before the event.
So she asked me to fill her position.
Even though I had planned something else to do I agreed because she's my very good friend.
The concert was due to start at 7 o'clock but we had to be there two hours before the beginning.
First I was supposed to help at the refreshment spot for the fans but some 15 minutes before beginning I was told to go backstage and help with the refreshments for the musicians, technicians and others who worked there.
It was very hectic there as everyone was a bit nervous but I saw the main stars and even managed to talk to them.
When they started to play I was told to change my post again.
This time I was helping the medical workers who had their hands full with teenage girls who had fainted.
First, it seemed to me odd because I didn't understand why they fainted, but as the concert went on, the heat in the air was increasing and so was the number of the unconscious.
It wasn't funny anymore and I didn't know what to do first.
I was really shocked by the sight of crying and shaking but completely happy girls sitting or lying on the floor.
I've just received the letter telling me that I've won first prize in your competition.
I guess you can imagine how happy and excited I am right now.
Regarding the best dates for my visit, I wonder if it would be possible to come in July because I'm going to sit a very important exam at the end of June.
Two weeks in the USA would be a great opportunity for me to relax after that.
The activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting.
I chose to play basketball (I play in a club, I am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
Last week I had planned to change my old basketball shoes.
So I took the train to Lausanne (I live in Lavaux and it's impossible to find the right pair of sneakers in !) to buy a new pair to play outdoors in this summer.
After having looked around the shops for 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for - the shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive).
So I went back to the station, very proud of myself with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face.
I stayed happy during the journey, thinking of how cool I would look in the playground with my brand-new shoes on.
How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play in old shoes for one more summer...
I am writing in response to your letter, in which you told me I am the winner in your competition, and my intention is to try to give you all the information you may need .
I would like to travel in July because I have another trip, to Spain, in August, which is the perfect month for me, otherwise I would not travel to Spain.
About accommodation, I would prefer a tent instead of a log cabin and the reason is I have never used tents and this could be a very exciting experience for me.
The two activities which I think would be best for me are swimming and sailing.
I love the sea, which is why I became interested in those activities when I was ten.
Therefore I have a lot of experience in both.
Thank you for asking about my latest good experience.
I will let you know what the important details are.
As you know, I helped at a pop concert last month.
I did things as unusual for me as cleaning instruments, organising people, and also looking after the artists' clothes.
In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only to wait there and give them what they asked for.
Organising people involved just a couple of things, telling people how to do the same as me and when.
The most exciting things were to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to listen to the Concert from the very first row.
All that I can say now is that I would do it again.
I will never forget that day.
I received your letter last week and was surprised to see that I had won a competition.
It is the first time it has happened to me.
Unfortunately I'm free only in July.
I will be busy working abroad until the end of June and will be on holiday with my family in August.
You asked me which accommodation I would prefer.
It's ages since I have slept in a tent and I would be happy to experience it again.
It will remind me of some wonderful experiences.
Regarding the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at.
The second activity I chose is sailing.
I have been on a sailing ship two times without doing anything, therefore I have got no experience at all.
Thank you very much for your last letter.
As you asked me in your letter, I will try to explain my wonderful experience at the pop concert.
First of all, you have to know that it wasn't an ordinary pop concert, but a real open-air festival.
This isn't the first year that I have worked there.
However, this year wasn't like last year.
My job was simply selling ice-creams.
You might say that it was quite boring, but it was such fun.
Everybody was so relaxed; we were singing and dancing while selling ice-creams in our little van.
Byran Adams himself bought me an ice-cream.
It was an amazing experience.
What I particularly liked about it was that the staff was like a big family.
Everybody was ready to help each other.
I was really impressed by this solidarity and friendship which is quite rare in Switzerland.
I would like to travel in July because, as I am working, this is the only time that I have to go on holiday.
About the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because I have a bad back and I think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me.
You also told me that I would have the chance of doing two activities.
I would like to go climbing, because it is something that I have been doing since I was a child, so I could consider myself an expert in it.
And I would like to try golf because this is a sport that I have never done but I have always wanted to try.
Nobody can deny that the main advantage of going shopping is the fact that, to do so, you do not need to make any effort.
that doing a sport or even going to work requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of money.
However, this apparently quiet and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people.
Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.
On balance I would say that although it is true that shopping is not a difficult activity, it is also true that it is definitely not an enjoyable one.
I received your letter this morning and I was very surprised by it.
It was an absolutely fantastic prize.
I am writing to you about your questions.
First, I can come there only in July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new term will also start in September.
I would like to stay in log cabins because I have stayed in tents many times in my childhood.
The most exciting offer is your activities.
I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance, so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing.
My grandfather used to do it when he was a student.
After he got a job, he became busy.
However, he retired from his job last year so he has had his own time.
If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my grandfather.
My main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
Do you know it? It's the hottest place in England.
Most of the people were , so they were lost.
I had also never been there before.
It's a huge building.
I also sold a pamphlet of that concert, CD and T-shirts.
Did you enjoy my letter? I can't explain to you very well.
Anyway, it was a wonderful time.
I'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy that I won the first prize.
I would prefer to travel only in July because it's when my vacations start.
I could even think about skipping school.
July is also good because the weather is warm and I could enjoy the time I will spend in the camp more.
I would prefer a tent because I'll be in touch with nature and I could listen to the sounds of the night.
The two activities that I've chosen are Climbing and Photography.
I've already climbed for four months on walls, indoor climbing.
I think I can handle it very well.
I've chosen Photography because I love to take pictures! I've never taken any classes or training but I think I can take very good pictures.
I would like to learn more about developing films.
I hope I've answered all your questions and I would be pleased if mine could also be answered.
How are you? What have you been doing there in New York? Did you find a girlfriend? Yesterday was Valentine's day here in Portugal.
In particular I had to spend it alone...
again.
I'm writing to you to tell you about a pop concert that happened here in São Rafael.
Red Hot Chilli Peppers came here for a short time and they played at the "Chedicard Hall".
It was really cool because I did some backstage work.
I helped with the , with some paperwork, with the microphones, with the computers.
I was everywhere.
I was kind of a "handy girl".
I did a little bit of everything..
The best part was when the band arrived.
I took lots of pictures, asked for autographs and I even gave them my cell phone number! They promised me that they would call me someday, which I particularly doubt.
Something that was also great was to watch the show from backstage.
It's a unique experience.
I wished you could have been there with me.
I hope you answer this letter as quickly as possible with lots of thing to tell me.
I have just received your letter which informs me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
In this letter you ask me for some further information .
Firstly, I can take my holiday only in the first two weeks of July because of my work.
Secondly, I would prefer to sleep in a tent.
I go camping every year in the countryside of France.
The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing.
I have never sailed but I am a good swimmer.
Last summer I took a climbing course for one week in Switzerland so I know a lot about this sport.
Finally could you please tell me what kind of clothes should I take with me and if the camping equipment is provided? I was also wondering how much money I need and if there is a safe place where I can put my money and passport.
I look forward to hearing from you soon and if you could send me a brochure of this holiday I would be grateful.
A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on Saturday because lots of people don't go to work then and it is the only day off for the majority of people.
If you don't get up early enough you can't find a parking space in the town centre.
All of them are full by 11 am.
street is so crowded that you can't walk like you usually do and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lose them.
, if you are lucky and you find some clothes which are the right size you will wait 20 minutes at the fitting room and after that 20 minutes more at the cash desk.
In the supermarket it is the same.
When you buy food or drink they give you a plastic bag to carry it in and these bags break every time.
Why not shop over the Internet or if you have a nice mother at home because shopping is like going into the jungle.
I would like to write about the experience that I had when I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in my neighbourhood.
I am a member of the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized last month.
I helped them to prepare the room for the bands and I decorated the place for the singers.
Also, I helped them to choose the right instruments and to test them.
It took a long time to test the speakers and the microphones.
Apart from this preparation, I also helped out during the concert.
I helped them to the music and the songs.
It was quite a difficult job but I got some very good experience.
I realised it when the concert had finished.
The audience was excited and I cannot describe my happiness.
It was something that I didn't expect.
Also, it was the first time in my life.
I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompanying our songs.
I enjoyed it very much and I want to convey my pleasure to you through this letter.
I am writing to you to give you some required information.
First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition.
I am happy to visit the United States with your organisation.
Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks' holiday then.
I also will be pleased to stay in a log cabin.
My experience of camping is not so huge as to encourage me to stay in a tent for 2 weeks.
You asked me what activities I would like to join in with.
Surfing is something that I have always wanted to try.
I have absolutely no experience in it.
Will it be possible to join a surfing school? For the second activity I have chosen photography.
I enjoy taking pictures of landscapes.
I have also attended a photography course.
So my standard is not a beginner's anymore.
I am looking forward to going on holiday.
Forgive me for not writing to you sooner.
As you know, I was fairly busy with studying for my First Certificate.
The concert was absolutely marvellous! So many happy people in the crowds, that the atmosphere was infectious.
Anyway, what you wanted to know was what my job was.
Actually my job was not really stressful, but I had contact with and access to all the famous pop stars.
I had to bring them refreshments.
That has been my dream since my childhood.
I was a little bit disappointed with their attitude.
They didn't really appreciate the service.
Some of them were quite rude.
Apart from that, it was an amazing experience.
If you ever have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating.
I liked seeing their way of life.
I hope you will write to me very soon and I hope to tell you more about my concert experience in the backstage area.
I would like to let you know that I can only travel in July because that is the only time I can take off from work.
I would prefer to stay in the log cabins as I would be afraid of insects or any crawling animals if I had to stay in the tent.
For activities , I would like to choose Tennis and swimming.
I used to play Tennis at tournament level and now I play it for enjoyment instead.
Swimming is my favourite way of exercising and keeping fit.
I find shopping is very time consuming.
If I want to buy a nice pair of shoes, I have to go into a city centre and browse around from shop to shop until I find the shoes I like.
If I'm not lucky enough to find them, then I have to take a train to a larger shopping such as London.
Whilst in London, I'll be facing crowds and people will be rushing everywhere.
To walk around London streets looking for a pair of shoes can definitely be a tiring task.
As I'm a compulsive buyer, I'd probably end up buying other things as well.
At the end of the day, I would not only be carrying a pile of shopping bags but also trying to squeeze in between other passengers on the train on my way home.
By the time I got home, I would be completely exhausted.
As you can see, shopping is not always enjoyable.
I have just received the letter from you.
I would like to thank you for choosing me.
In the letter you ask when I would like to go.
The most suitable month is July, because my pen friend is going to visit me in June.
Also I because I have just finished my military service and I got used to staying on the camp.
There are two activities.
I am good at Basketball and tennis.
I played Basketball at university.
At university I attended tennis lessons for two years.
Finally I would like to ask you if I need to bring money and clothes with me.
Last month I had a great time in Derby.
I went with Big Brothers, which is the name of the band.
As I told you two months ago, I saw the advertisement in the newspaper.
This group was looking for a Manager.
I went for the interview and I got the job.
They did not know each other.
They just met each other a month ago.
Just before the concert I had to check that everyone was present.
Also I had to look for a dry place in case it was raining.
I really liked that.
I had to run all the time.
This was my job and I liked what I was doing.
The concert was brilliant.
Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel in July because of the exams I have in May.
Also I would not be able to travel there until the end of June.
It does not matter to me whether I stay in a tent or a log cabin, but I would prefer a tent so as to be in closer contact with the wildlife and nature.
The activities I'd like to do most are playing basketball and Climbing.
The first one because I have been playing basketball since the age of twelve and the second one because there are not many places to go climbing in my city.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take my own clothes with me or if you will provide me with some, and about the amount of money needed.
It was terrible! We had a lot of problems from the beginning.
The first one was the security.
The people in charge of security didn't arrive when they were supposed to.
If it hadn't been a calm and quiet crowd, we would have had trouble.
Another problem was the band.
They didn't want to play until the venue was crowded.
So the concert started an hour and a half late.
Everything was all right during the band's performance, but at the end some spectators came up on the stage and did some damage to the band's instruments.
The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they left immediately, leaving the public without the last part of the show.
As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both of which I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert.
Despite all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the best experience I've ever had.
Thank you for your letter.
I'm pleased that I've won the first prize: two weeks at camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July because I am going to finish college at the end of June and I will work from the first of August.
regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin.
I think that will be safer for all my things.
I'm very keen to have the chance to take part in some activities.
I'm very interested in the golf.
I will be a beginner because I've never done this sport before but I will have a try.
Also, I choose surfing.
I love this sport.
I've been doing this sport for 5 years, so I'm quite good.
Thank you for your last letter.
I really envy you your holiday in the sun.
Last month was amazing for me.
I was helping at a pop concert.
All right, I wasn't able to do all the stuff like the lights, the , the sound but I helped to build the stage and .
The stage was gigantic.
The crowd .
I really enjoyed being next to the pop stars.
I got a lot of autographs.
That was the first time I've seen someone like Jagger.
A lot of well-known pop stars were there.
I mean, it's still unbelievable.
Can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking their hands.
I have very good memories of this experience.
I think I will go back next year.
I'm writing to give you the information you requested in your letter dated March 31st, in which you informed me that I have won first prize in your competition.
I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has allowed me to take my holidays in that month.
I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in a log cabin.
I have never liked staying in tents because I think they are uncomfortable, especially if the stay is going to last more than two or three days.
It's difficult for me to choose two activities from your list, but I think I would like to play basketball.
I have never been good at team sports, but I really like basketball and I think it can be very interesting to meet other people by means of this team sport.
I like swimming too, because I think it is one of the best sports to keep you fit and healthy.
I would be very grateful if you could give me some additional information.
What type of clothes must I take? Is it necessary to take formal dress for any formal events? Must I take cash or can I use credit cards? Thank you in advance for your help.
We arrived at the stadium the evening before.
The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help with anything they needed done.
Firstly, we were asked to clean the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings.
When we finished cleaning, some of us offered to help to bring the sound equipment into the stadium.
They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the stage was being prepared for the concert.
I still believe it has only been a dream! I am willing to show you the autograph and the photograph.
Let me know if you are going to come so that I can prepare the bedroom to put you up in.
Thank you for your letter informing me about the prize I had won.
I would like to answer your questions.
Please note that I can travel only in July because only then can I take holidays from my work, after the busy time in the months of May and June.
I prefer to stay in a cabin because I have never been on holiday in a tent before, so I think it is more comfortable to sleep in a bed instead of outside in a tent.
The activities I would like to do during these two weeks are basketball and swimming.
I think I can play basketball well, because a few years ago I was a member of the school team.
Swimming is not my favourite sport but I prefer swimming to golf or tennis.
Please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that I know how much money I have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that I know what kind of clothes I have to take.
I am looking forward to this holiday.
I would like to tell you about my experience at the last pop concert.
It was very nice for me to help because I saw so many people and I got a lot of experience of things that I had never done before.
I was the assistant of the person responsible for the clothes and make-up of the pop group.
Really I was very nervous about that because it was my first time with such famous people, but I am very happy that all the things went very well.
Kim, what I really particularly liked was when I was asked to do the make-up on my own.
Really I was very nervous but at the same time very happy, but everything went well and everybody was very happy with my work.
Really I think you have to try to do the same thing next summer, I really enjoyed it.
I am writing to thank you for your letter confirming that I won the first prize in your competition.
I would also like to give you some information about me in order to arrange the details for the trip.
First of all, I would like to inform you that I will be able to travel only during July because in June I am going to sit examinations for the First Certificate in English.
Furthermore, in August I will be preparing for my course at the university where I am starting next September.
Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange accommodation for me in log cabins as I am not used to staying in the countryside and especially not in tents.
In addition, I would like to inform you that I would prefer to do Surfing and Sailing while I am at the camp, as I am an active member of the Sailing and Surfing Club of Manchester and it will be a great chance for me to practise my techniques and skills.
I would also be grateful if you could send me information about the average cost of living in California, as I have to work out the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need.
I would also like you to specify if the food is included in the prize.
As requested, I visited some classes during lessons and some other rooms while activities were taking place.
The aim of this report is to make a series of suggestions on which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to on the football pitch as it is completely new and fully equipped.
In addition, I think you the school's nursery as there are a lot of facilities for the children, and the parents can see that the teachers are very good.
I also think that it will be a good idea to take some general of the school area as there is a huge .
In conclusion, I have to declare that I and my fellow students will be available to help with this short video .
It was great to hear from you.
I cannot believe I'm the winner of your competition.
As far as the further information you need from me is concerned, I am very glad to give you all the relevant details.
I would like to travel in July; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course at university at the end of June and I will start to work in September.
As far as accommodation is concerned, I would like to live in a tent at Camp California.
I prefer this type of accommodation because I am used to living in tents during my summer holidays.
The concert last month! The singer was fabulous and the musicians played fantastic songs.
I was employed in security.
I did it for free because it was a non-profit concert to help the poor people.
It was the first time for me and I consider this experience the best of my life.
I had to look after people near the stage.
The organiser gave me a radio and I had to advise the other staff members in case of any disorder.
At the same time I could enjoy the music! I think this is what I particularly liked about this experience.
First, I would like to thank you for offering me this wonderful prize.
For a long time I have wanted to go to Camp California, and now my dream is about to come true.
There is no more time left in my timetable in August since I will have to work then, so I would rather come in July.
Concerning the accommodation, I would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience I had in Ireland because of the weather...
Since this stay at Camp California is a good opportunity to try out new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner at both activities.
I apologize for not having written this letter sooner, but as you probably know, I was actually really busy because of the pop concert.
What a great experience that was! I will remember it for a long time because of two reasons.
Moreover, the work I had to do, apart from carrying equipment, was essentially to sell tickets for the concert, which allowed me to meet a lot of nice people and to become friends with some of them.
Even though my entire body aches (the equipment was quite heavy) and I am tired, I wouldn't call it work! I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I'm writing concerning your letter about my winning two weeks at Camp California in your competition.
I'm very happy to be the winner of your competition.
Because I'm working in an accountant's office, I'm very busy.
The only month I could go on holiday is July, when we haven't got a lot to do.
Moreover, concerning the accommodation, I would like to be in a tent, because I want to spend my holidays .
And in my opinion, when you sleep in a tent, you .
I like a lot on your list of sports possibilities.
However, I will choose swimming.
I was a member of a swimming club for about 10 years.
Additionally I'm keen on taking pictures.
But so far I have only taken pictures on holiday and of some family celebrations.
Lastly, I would like to ask if I have to take a lot of money with me, for the food for example, and also if the weather will be good at this time of year.
I would like to begin this composition by saying that shopping is not the same for everyone.
For some people it's great fun, but for some others it's a "necessity".
In my opinion, shopping is like relaxing.
I like to go very often, to look around and to buy some new clothes, as long as I am not searching for something specific.
When I must buy something, I usually can't find it and then shopping becomes a nightmare.
On the other hand, when you go shopping with someone else, and you both want to see and buy different things, it can also be boring.
Then it is perhaps better when you make an appointment in one hour and everybody does their shopping alone.
To sum up, I would like to say that to have an exciting shopping trip, you sometimes have to plan it or just be in the right mood.
I'm writing to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that camp.
I can only travel in July, because that is when I stop playing basketball to rest before starting the new season.
I don't mind staying wherever you want me to.
However, I prefer log cabins to tents.
They're more comfortable.
Regarding the activities, I would love to play basketball.
I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player.
The other activities don't appeal to me much, but I'm quite good at golf.
I like surfing and playing tennis, and sports such as sailing and climbing.
Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it.
There are no more questions.
I'm writing to you to tell you how much I enjoyed last Saturday.
It was such a beautiful night! Unforgettable.
I had always dreamt of being near "The Cranberies", but I had never thought that the dream could become reality.
During the afternoon, Tim and I spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held.
At seven o'clock on the dot we went there to start queueing.
We bought the tickets and then we sat down to rest.
After a few minutes the dream happened: Kare - the guitarist - appeared over there.
At first we both thought we were dreaming but when we realised it was true we went there and asked him some questions.
And then we carried his guitar for him.
It was great to help him.
Finally he said how grateful he was and allowed us to stay with them till the concert started.
I am writing in connection with the competition I entered a month ago.
I received your letter, and I was delighted to know that I won it.
As requested, below is some further information and some questions.
As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer to sleep in a tent.
I have been travelling every summer since I was eighteen years of age and this type of accommodation is part of the ritual.
I would very much enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good at it.
In addition I would love to attend the photography classes even though I have never tried to take a picture before.
I hope I have given you all the information you needed.
From my point of view, I would just like to know what sort of clothes I should bring with me and also how much money.
The festival lasted three days and I had the best fun of my life.
I went as a volunteer in order to go for free.
I had to help the Green Peace teams to recycle everything we could.
There were more or less two hundred students doing the same job.
Our duty was to work eight hours each day and then we were free to enjoy the rest of the day as we liked.
The accommodation and the food were part of the contract...
everything free.
They provided us with tents and also a VIP pass in order to get food.
Oh my God!!! It was the best experience you can imagine.
I met lots of nice cool people, and what I most enjoyed was the crazy atmosphere of the whole thing.
No matter how hard we had to work, everyone was always funny and in a positive mood.
I am very glad to hear from you that I have won the first prize.
I appreciate all this.
I am writing to you about my information which you need.
Firstly, I am afraid that I am available to travel only in July because it is difficult to get holiday from my work at the moment.
I prefer staying in tents to log cabins because I have really been interested in making tents and staying in them.
Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose basketball and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends through these kinds of sports.
Both could be exciting for me.
I would like to know more about clothes and money.
I have got no idea about them.
I would be grateful if you could send me some information about them.
I am happy to write a letter to you.
What I really want to tell you is about my recent experience.
Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance.
I have just worked as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I always see on TV.
Of course, I could listen to all their music, which was so cool.
After the concert I had an opportunity to join them at the party.
The best thing was that I have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and I have sung my favourite songs with them.
In particular, Mike, who is a member of Metal Potato told me I have got a talent for playing the electric guitar.
It is impossible to explain all my experience without this word, "Brilliant!!!".
I would like to invite you to their next concert and share my experience with you.
Please let me know as soon as possible if you want to come.
Firstly I would like to thank you for my prize.
This trip pleases me because I've never been to the USA.
Secondly I am going to answer your questions.
I can travel only in July because I study at an engineer's school in France and in summer we have our holidays from July.
I prefer to stay in tents, where it is easier to meet other people than in log cabins.
When I travel I don't often sleep in a hotel, I prefer tents and also I can meet people who live in the country.
Regarding the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf.
This is a sport that I have always wanted to play but in France it is too expensive.
So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to miss it.
I would like to try photography too.
There are so many monuments in California and so I will remember this holiday with my photographs.
Could you send me more information about what clothes to take with me? Finally I would like to ask you if I need any money, because you say all accommodation and travel costs are paid for.
I was backstage, so I could speak with the singer before the concert.
During half an hour he explained to me how he feels in France.
I had to serve glasses of water to the group before and during the concert, so I had a lot of contact with them.
They are very nice.
After the concert, I went to eat with them in a restaurant near the stadium where they had played.
What I particularly liked about this experience is that I saw that famous people are like us and have the same interests.
I think that this experience is something that you have to live too.
Perhaps at the next concert we will go together.
I will keep you informed about it.
I hope you will answer my letter and tell me if you are interested in my proposition.
I'm sending you with my letter a photo of the singer that he gave me.
Thank you very much for your letter, which I received last week.
I was delighted to hear that I won the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would be very grateful if you could give me more details as soon as possible.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
How are you? I haven't heard from you for such a long time.
I hope everything is alright with you.
Sorry! I haven't written to you for the last two months, because I have been very busy helping and organizing the pop concert which took place near my town.
Let me tell you more about what I did last month.
I had a wonderful experience helping with the pop concert last month.
My duty was to help them cook for all of them during the concert.
As you know I'm very good at cooking and everybody loved ! Secondly, I helped them to prepare the clothes and the costumes during the concert.
Although I have never worked with clothes and art before, I enjoyed it very much.
What I liked most about my experience at the concert was the great atmosphere behind the stage and the live music, which made me feel great and happy.
What's more, I had an opportunity to meet a singer who I love and I dream about.
He also gave me his address and telephone number if I need help from him in the future.
I'll show you when you come around to see me.
I was very glad to receive this great news.
I am very excited about it.
I entered this competition because I have always wanted to do this kind of thing.
In your letter you asked me when I would prefer to travel.
I will be able to travel only in July because I have to work and I can take some days off in that month.
If it is not a problem I would rather stay in a log cabin because I do not like sleeping on the floor much, but if you cannot put me there I will be fine anywhere.
About the activities I have to choose I would like to tell you something.
I am very good at tennis and photography but I would prefer to do new ones, if it is possible.
I am keen on water and danger sports so I would choose climbing and surfing.
I think it would be great if I learnt them while I am there.
Finally, I would like to ask you if there is any place where I can buy some souvenirs, if there is I will take some money with me, and I would be very grateful if you could send me a list of clothes.
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping.
It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping.
You can go shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing about it is that you feel that you have while you are buying things.
Maybe it is not for you, maybe you are shopping for a present, but buying things, at least for me, is the best.
When you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not caring about anybody, this could drive anyone crazy.
The long queues, crowded places, high prices, sales, all these things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.
But my advice for people who like it so much that they cannot help doing it is to try shopping in the afternoon.
At this time no-one goes shopping and if there are some shops that are closed you can always go to a shopping mall.
Taking photographs during the holiday is a very good memory for me, and I can share my adventures with my friends.
So while I am at the Camp I want to take a lot of photographs and climb a mountain.
.
By the way, I wonder if I need a lot of money and what kind of clothes I should bring.
Finally, thanks for giving me this opportunity.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for women.
You can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected.
Some people enjoy window shopping, but some people enjoy spending their money on clothes or shoes.
Nowadays, in a family, shopping isn't a woman's job.
On the other hand, after shopping you'll get tired and maybe you can't afford your credit card.
For instance, you wanted to buy everything which you saw, and after that, you don't know how much you have spent.
If you are going shopping someone can easily steal your wallet when you are looking at some interesting things.
It would be really awful.
However, shopping has pros and cons.
It depends on personal taste.
I enjoy shopping very much.
It can help me know what's going on in the world.
But it is a good idea to have a break during the shopping trip, then you won't feel so tired.
Thank you very much for your letter concerning the competition.
Here is the information you require.
Thirdly, from the activity list, I chose swimming and tennis as my favourite ones.
Although I have played tennis only twice, I really enjoyed it.
In contrast to this , I could swim when I was six.
Furthermore, I once trained in a swimming centre, so I am quite confident as a swimmer.
The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video about my school.
In my opinion, maths, politics, Chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones.
They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
As far as I know, English people are really surprised at the Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as their knowledge of politics.
This is a good opportunity to see how they learn in class.
.
You can find students using traditional Chinese ink to draw and write.
As well as these lessons, there are all kinds of activities such as sports meetings, racing competitions, and countryside activities.
Some are held once a year and some are held every term.
You will experience a different life in them.
In conclusion, besides all that I mentioned, I highly recommend you video the students' daily life and interview them.
That will definitely make it a successful video.
I am really glad to receive the first prize in your competition.
It will be very pleasant .
Regarding your first question, I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holiday so I would not miss any classes.
I rather prefer to stay in tents because I like to stay as close as possible to nature; it makes me feel better.
As regards activities I would choose singing and surfing.
Surfing because it is my favourite sport.
I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good at it.
And singing because I really love it.
I am not as good at singing as I am at surfing but I like doing it.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand to the band called RAMONES.
It was a breeze to help them and was very cool as well; those guys really know how to play rock.
I only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with water whenever they wanted.
When the band had just started to play, lots of girls started to jump the fence getting very close to them.
Some of the girls started to take their clothes off, which was the best part for me, but some of the security went there and took them away.
I had a really nice time with them even though I would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people, but anyway it was a great experience for me, I hope to be able to help them next year.
I hope you've enjoyed my experience, and I hope to hear from you soon.
I received your letter and would be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
but I will only be able to go in July because in June I will be in Austria with a friend and for August I have rented an apartment with my family.
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary equipment for camping.
While I am at the camp I would like to play tennis and do photography.
I play tennis very well since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice at photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it.
Although many people enjoy shopping, shopping is not always enjoyable.
You can come across a very disagreeable shop assistant and if you find what you wanted, you will not want to pay him or her for it.
Sometimes the assistant might even ignore you as he or she is talking to another assistant.
For example, you walk into a shoe store.
Two assistants are talking and, although they saw you enter, they continue their discussion so you have to interrupt them.
Then, one of them serves you but half listens to you because he or she is still talking to the other assistant.
There is nothing more disagreeable than that.
Also, when you find a nice assistant and he shows you lots of objects, then you don't find what you want, you feel sad for him or her because you made him or her waste his or her time, so you feel obliged to buy something.
All this is to say that shopping may seem enjoyable but often is not.
Thank you for choosing me in your competition for first prize.
I feel very happy and I must answer your letter immediately.
I would like to travel only in July, because I will have a holiday at that time.
I'm always having holidays in July.
It is my favourite time for holidays.
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer tents, because I used to stay in tents when on holiday.
I like it.
From the activities which you offer me I choose swimming and tennis.
I am very good at swimming.
I have done this sport since I was a child and I really enjoy it.
I'm not so good at tennis but I would like to play it to get some practice.
Also I find that this sport is very good for my health and makes me feel better.
.
Some people like to go shopping.
I hate it.
I have never liked shopping.
It has always been a problem for me.
I don't like to have many things in my house.
I don't like to have many clothes and shoes, and I don't know what else.
Just the necessary.
I think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
They are wasting time in their life for nothing.
In my opinion we must spend more time on more interesting things than shopping, like sport, reading, chatting about ideas which make our lives better.
We must do something to help other people to feel better and be useful.
I can go to Camp California only in July, because I have school in June and I must work in my father's bookshop in August.
At the Camp I want to stay in a log cabin.
I do not like tents; one can find insects in them and they are not as comfortable as log cabins.
For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience of this sport, because I played tennis for seven years and it is still my favourite activity.
I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted.
Do you know, last week I went to a pop concert to help my uncle, who is the director of the stadium of Lugano.
It was very interesting, because I did different things.
I cooked a meal for the artists, I spoke with the Bruce Springsteen's manager and I helped a technician to install his equipment: the lights.
I talked with Santana, the best guitarist in the world, too.
He's quite old, but very attractive.
I would like to play guitar like him.
What a great day it was.
The next concert is on 19th June and I will be there.
I am delighted to receive your letter saying that I have won a two-week holiday in your recent competition and it will all be paid for in advance.
I am writing this letter so as to give you the information which will help you to organize all the necessary details of the forthcoming holiday.
I would be grateful if you could arrange a date after the 20th of July, due to problems beyond my control.
Otherwise I will not be able to travel abroad.
I would rather stay in one of the log cabins as I am allergic to many plants and insects and I should avoid coming into contact with them.
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp.
As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in those activities.
I came second in last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes.
On the camp I can practise them a lot.
I am terribly sorry not to drop you a line since the last time we wrote to one another.
But I have finally got around to writing and you'll see that it's definitely been worth waiting for as I have some great and unbelievable news to tell you.
As you know I'm on half-term school holiday and have plenty of time to do many more things apart from studying my A-level history, such as meeting up with my friends, visiting interesting places or even going to the cinema on my own.
However, this term has been a far cry from the others.
You will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read through my letter.
Write to me soon.
I have just received your letter and I am glad to know that I have won first prize in your competition.
Now, I am writing to you to ask for some details about these two weeks at Camp California and to give you some answers to your questions.
First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am on holiday.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in a tent as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child.
Furthermore, you asked me to choose two activities I would like to do.
Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to do this sport with my village club and won a few competitions.
Secondly, I am very interested in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time together.
We had a lot of fun during our last holiday and we took a lot of pictures.
As instructions about clothes and money were not included in your letter, .
Thank you very much.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
A lot of people like shopping but most of them might tell you that sometimes it is not enjoyable.
And nowadays people must go shopping whether they like it or not.
For people who are used to shopping, going in big stores, I think they like it and it they are always looking for fashionable clothes.
But when these stores are full of people, crowded, like during the sales , I am sure that the same people who like shopping may think it boring.
In my opinion, people have to go shopping even though they don't like it very much.
If these people have children, they must buy some food to feed them even if the supermarket is full of people.
And now for them shopping can be considered .
I am writing this letter to tell you the information you need and to ask you one or two questions.
I would like to come in July because I work for a big company where you have to take your holiday in that month.
For the accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer to have a log cabin because I think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain .
A log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
I'm writing this letter to tell you about my good experience at a pop concert, last month.
I can only travel to California this July because then I will be on my winter holidays.
Before and after this period is impossible for me: I have classes and I also have to work.
About the accommodation, I prefer to stay in tents.
I have always dreamed about going camping and staying in a tent.
Now my dream will finally come true.
I think this way is better to keep in touch with nature.
I would like to do photography and swimming.
I love to take photos but I don't have any technique.
I would like to learn more about it.
I have always swum and I can say I'm good at it.
We can hear many people saying that when they are upset or stressed they like to go shopping.
It is a kind of relief for them.
Of course it is good to buy things for ourselves, like clothes, jewellery, anything.
Especially if we don't have to worry about money.
It's good to walk around looking at all the new things in the stores.
But, sometimes, going shopping can have other effects on you.
It can stress you.
For example, when the place is crowded and noisy and you can't even move easily to look around.
When you can't find what you are looking for anywhere.
When you buy something you were looking for a long time and, when you arrive at home, you discover some defect on it and have to go back to the store to complain.
It is just terrible when the assistants don't treat us well.
Sometimes we just give up and never come back to that store.
And, a really bad thing is, after buying everything you wanted and feeling very happy with all that, you realize that you spent more money than you should have...
So, after all this, I suggest that before you decide to go shopping to feel better you should think of all the problems you may have while you are shopping or the big headache you can have after it.
It would probably be better if you just went shopping when you really needed and, to relax, you can talk to a friend, read a book or listen to good music.
Remember: going shopping is not always the best choice.
It can be very unpleasant sometimes.
I have received the letter which tells me that I have won first prize in your competition.
I am going to write about the information which you want to know.
First, I would like to travel in July only, because I have got a job and July is the only time I can have a vacation.
Secondly, I would like to choose a tent for accommodation, because I have never spent time in a tent, that's why, I think it is a good opportunity for me.
I would like to choose swimming and photography as activities.
I have plenty of experience and knowledge of both .
Lastly, I would like to ask you two questions.
One of them is what kind of clothes are suitable on this camp.
Another one is how much money I have to bring.
I would be grateful if you could inform me.
Hi! How are you doing? I had a wonderful time last month.
I helped at a pop concert as a volunteer.
My jobs were collecting tickets, selling goods and refreshments, guiding people to the right seat and cleaning up the concert hall after the concert finished.
I wasn't allowed to help do heavy work, even though I wanted to , because I'm a woman.
What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support.
It seemed that all people, the audience, the band and the staff were delightful.
If I have the chance, I want to help at a concert again.
I have never felt such satisfaction.
I really recommend you to help them, I think this is a good opportunity and I want you to understand my feeling well.
I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you about.
I want to know your opinion.
I am writing to thank you for sending me all the details about my prize and I'd like to give you all the information about the .
I would like to travel at the beginning of the month, which could be between the first and the fifteenth of July, because afterwards I have several business meetings and it would be difficult for me to take a trip.
Really, .
I want to do two activities: painting and tennis.
The first one is for my mental health.
I need a break from my lifestyle.
The second one is just because I'm a fan of that sport (really I'm not martine hingis).
, I'd like to request some special food, because I'm a vegetarian , besides I try to eat just organic food.
I hope my reply has been helpful.
How are you doing? It has been a long time since the last time I wrote to you...
I'm sorry.
However, the reason is absolutely amazing.
I was training to be a personal assistant to Madonna herself.
Maybe you don't believe me, but it's true.
I applied for the job and she selected me from hundreds of candidates (I don't receive any salary).
My job is to help her during each concert.
You know she has a brilliant act where she must change her costumes, make-up, the scenery, ; so she needs a lot of people near.
My first job was at the Hillsborough concert ( I think you heard about it).
I was running the whole show.
My responsibility was to dress her.
I wasn't alone.
I worked with a staff of ten people.
We had to take some clothes off her and then to put on other completely different ones in just a few minutes (similar to Formula One).
I was exhausted when the concert finished.
Anyway it has been one of my best experiences and I'll remember it for ever.
Finally, I send you all my positive energy and I am looking forward to receiving your reply.
I would like to travel only in July because I am working in a bank and I can only go on holiday in July.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I used to go camping and stay in a tent.
Therefore I would like to .
I am interested in tennis but I am not so good a tennis player.
However, I would like to .
In addition swimming would be a good activity for me.
While I was studying at the high school and the university, I was in the swimming team .
I think all people like shopping.
When you ask some people to express their opinions about shopping they might tell you they don't like shopping but I don't suppose it is true.
For example , when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I didn't like it.
However, now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be, "Yes, I like it".
When people hear this word shopping they only think about going to some stores and trying on new clothes or shoes and searching for their size and so on.
They don't think about other kinds of shopping which are .
Maybe they like shopping on the Internet or window shopping; it doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like.
There are a lot of shopping styles in the world.
I am sure everybody likes one of them.
In my opinion, even though people say shopping is not always enjoyable, there is always some fun you can have.
You only need to discover what you like, and how you can have fun with shopping.
I think I could leave for the camp in July.
Because I'm supposed to attend an English course in Weymouth, England until June and then I'm going to travel in Europe with my sister who came from my country 4 weeks ago for this trip.
We are planning to spend 2 weeks travelling.
So I can go to the camp in the middle of July.
And I'd like to stay in a log cabin.
I've had unpleasant experiences on my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent.
In addition, as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin.
Most of all, I'm so happy that I could choose some activities.
I'd like to practise golf and tennis.
Both of them are my favourite sports and I'm quite good.
I would be grateful if you could send me further information.
I'll look forward to your reply.
But nowadays I find shopping is not always enjoyable.
Since I started living in England, I've worked two part time jobs as a cleaner.
I can't make enough money for my living expenses.
I have to control my expenses .
It's not easy for me, as I used to depend on my parents before I came here.
 Anyway, I must check and even compare the prices of different supermarkets.
I would like to travel only in July because in August I have to study for an exam.
Further I would prefer to stay in a tent at the camp, because I am already used to that, because I often spend my holidays in tents.
I would like to do painting, because one of my greatest hobbies is silk painting and so I think I can improve my abilities.
The second activity which I choose is playing basketball, because I love this wonderful sport.
We always play it at school and I am very good at it.
I am in our school basketball team.
I hope that you are now well informed and I would like to ask you what clothes and how much money I should bring with me.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to hearing from you.
My first task was to open the doors to let in all the Britney Spears fans.
I stood at the entrance and there I had to check the tickets.
Two girls came together and they wanted to go in with only one ticket for both of them! I had to tell one of them that she had to leave.
She started crying.
Such a poor girl! At that moment I didn't like my position.
My second task was to look in all the fans' bags to confiscate "dangerous" items.
I saw really funny things like toothbrushes in the bags.
This part of my work was really funny and I enjoyed it.
Summing up, I can say that it was a fantastic day, because Britney sang so beautifully and the performance was also super.
I hope you can imagine what a wonderful day it was for me.
I am writing to you to answer the questions in your letter.
I was glad to hear the news from you and thank you very much! I'm afraid I am only free in July, because I go on holiday in July, naturally, and I June and August.
Therefore, I hope that you can agree to a suitable arrangement between you and me.
Furthermore, I would like to stay in log cabins, which I feel are a more American style of accommodation.
In addition, it should not be too hot inside during July.
If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs.
Because I grew up in a town that is a seaside city, I started training in 1996, and I have never given it up.
In particular, it was really good for my health .
Photography is my hobby .
I can remember that I used to take photographs of the exhibitions or during the holidays.
It will be nice when I am older.
In addition, it could show people how nice the places I have been are and the .
Therefore, I would like to do those two activities.
.
There are more and more retailers opening .
Therefore, people usually go shopping weekly or monthly.
In my opinion, women really enjoy shopping.
.
However, we are going to change from the traditional system to "e-shopping".
It is new for customers.
With technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want.
Therefore, it and is also boring for the customer.
I think most men dislike shopping.
They are always waiting for a long time for women to finish their shopping.
I believe that most busy people want to go shopping the quick and easy way, because they don't like waiting for and wasting time .
Therefore, they would like to use "e-shopping", which is .
The lifestyle has changed already from the past.
Shopping is a common activity in their life.
We must focus on the specific , which will make us happy.
 In conclusion, I believe that shopping only wastes time .
.
Thank you for telling me that I have won the first prize and now I am writing to give you the information you have requested.
First of all, I think I would like to travel in July, which will be the only month when I will be able to go, because my course won't finish until the end of June, and I will have to stay in the college to get ready for the new term.
Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California.
I think sleeping in a tent is more fun than other .
Also, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose.
For one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most.
I and my friend used to win the first in the match when we were at school.
And for the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; painting is one of my hobbies and I've been studying it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it when I have some free time.
Above is all the information you asked for.
However, there are some things I'd like to know; the first is about the clothes.
What kind of clothes do I need to take with me? And another question is what are the prices of things like there, which I want to know so that I can make a better budget for my trip.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would be interested in my experience of helping at the pop concert .
Now I will tell you about it.
The place where we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days setting up the stage, the equipment, and the lights.
In fact, there was nothing very important I did, because we were not the right people to do it.
I only put the speakers in the right places, or helped the engineers test the lights.
But in the breaks and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engineers, and I learnt something about setting up the equipment.
The fourth day, the singers and the musicians were there to .
Then I had a chance to speak with them.
From that, I learnt more about the instruments.
Finally, the day of the concert came.
After the concert finished successfully, I was happier than ever because the success included my work and that was the most enjoyable moment in my life.
I am replying .
As you asked in the letter, I will write everything I need to know about the trip.
First of all, I would like to travel in July, because, during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for exams or I will be away travelling somewhere else with my relatives.
I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in a tent, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new.
Also, it seems more dangerous.
Regarding the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activity that I have never done before, which is Sailing.
I am a total beginner at this.
The other activity is Photography.
I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera.
All I want is to improve my knowledge.
I will be waiting for a reply.
I'm sorry it took so long for me to answer your letter, but I've been too busy with my school, papers and everything.
But now I have found some time to tell you everything about the pop concert I helped .
There were about a hundred people that wanted to help, but only two would be chosen.
When they said my name, I couldn't believe it! All I could think was "Oh my god, I'm gonna be talking with and helping the most famous pop bands!" I was so excited that I couldn't believe it.
When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice to me that it seemed we had known each other for ages! They weren't the kind of people that think they're gods.
I don't know exactly how I felt.
Sometimes I wake up and think it was nothing but a dream.
I hope you liked everything I said and I hope you reply as soon as possible.
I am very pleased about the prize I just won in your competition.
Thank you for choosing me.
Here is some further information about myself and a few enquiries.
First of all, I am sorry to say that I can only travel in July.
As my family's new restaurant is about to open in August, I need to help with the restaurant, which is expected to be rather busy.
As for selecting two activities, basketball and surfing are definitely on my list.
I spend one third of my spare time playing basketball.
As a result, I have an important position in our local basketball team.
Surfing was a new sport to me which I took up recently.
It is really fascinating to challenge the waves.
I wish I could learn to be better so that I could enjoy it more in the future.
It was a pop concert by Steps in the M.E.N Arena.
And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.
A few minutes after the concert began, a backstage assistant called in sick who was responsible for checking whether everything was going well according to the timetable.
If something comes up, she should inform the other staff.
I was then taken on to cover her job.
I couldn't find my feet at first as I was so nervous.
I was given lots of paper with many different times on it.
I did manage to "study" them though, thanks to the other staff.
They were very helpful and nice.
They patiently explained to me my job even though they were fairly busy themselves.
Then I found it was not as complicated as I thought at first.
And I guess I did a good job as everything was going quite well.
I saw all the members of the band backstage, how they changed their make-up, hairstyle etc.
They were even making jokes with me and other staff.
I was impressed when they kept saying "thank you" to the staff.
Indeed, they cannot succeed without their help, can they? I was lucky to have this chance and able to learn how they work behind the scenes.
All in all, it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
I am very happy to hear that I've won first prize in your competition.
Below I provide you with the information that you asked me for.
I would like to travel in July.
I already have plans for my holiday and July suits me the best.
As for accommodation, I would prefer log cabins, because I believe they are more comfortable than tents.
I have never tried those sports, because they are quite expensive.
First I would like to say that making a video about daily life at our school is a great idea.
Some people may think that school is boring and nothing interesting ever happens there.
I hope that after seeing this video most people will change their view on that topic.
To make that happen, we have to find some interesting activities to film.
Below are my suggestions for what should be filmed.
The first thing to be filmed is our English lesson, because our teacher Mr.
S.
has a lot of weird ideas and we could get a lot of fun moments on tape.
The chemistry lesson should be filmed because we do a lot of interesting experiments there.
The computer class could be also there, because programming and internet surfing are quite interesting.
As for other activities, there is a Jiu-Jitsu class after regular lessons.
Martial arts are really exciting and are a great thing to film.
I am writing to give you information about myself.
Even though I would like to travel, I am only available in July, because I am a high school student.
Thus I have not got a long holiday.
I just have one month .
Personally, I would rather stay in log cabins than in tents.
On account of the fact that staying in log cabins is much more interesting than staying in tents.
As far as two activities are concerned, I would choose singing and photography.
I used to win a number of competitions in singing.
I can sing plenty of songs, which include English songs and the Japanese songs, and I have a part-time job singing at a restaurant.
Although photography is not as good as singing, I am very interested in it.
I have been studying photography since I was 15 years old.
I got third prize in a competition last year and my level is professional now.
Furthermore, I am going to enter a competition next year.
I would like to ask for some information about what kind of clothes I have to wear and how much you charge.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
Sometimes there is a long queue or a machine is broken.
A lot of circumstances will arise.
I had an unpleasant experience.
It was at lunchtime.
Everybody had gone to buy lunch in the supermarket.
In fact, nobody likes crowds and queues, especially not in the summertime.
I was queuing .
I chose this aisle because I thought it was quicker than the others.
.
Suddenly the customer thought the receipt was not right.
She did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make a mistake.
They argued about this thing.
The shop manager came to solve it.
Obviously, I had to try another aisle.
It was the longest queue I have ever been in.
Shopping is enjoyable, if you are lucky.
Even though I think most of the time it is very interesting, sometimes it gets people upset.
I am glad that I have won first prize in your competition.
I was very surprised to win.
You ask me in your letter when I would like to travel.
The answer is the following one: I can only travel in July because I have to work all August.
I can take holidays only in the month of July.
You ask me if I prefer to sleep in tents or log cabins.
I prefer the tents because I never use this kind of accommodation.
I have chosen the two following activities.
The first one is tennis and the second one is sailing.
I have been playing tennis for many years.
I have even entered competitions.
I like this game a lot.
I have chosen sailing because I would like to try a new sport.
I love water but I have never tried this sport before.
Yours sincerely.
The first thing is the location of the shops.
Sometimes you have to go far away from home to do your shopping and it takes a lot of time.
The second thing is that you need to go shopping when the supermarkets are open.
Many people work late and they do not have enough time to go shopping.
The third thing is the crowds.
Everybody does their shopping at the same time and often in the same place.
It is almost a battle to buy different things and to pay for those things.
People are often irritable and aggressive.
Sometimes you can see fights between two men or women.
There is one more thing.
When you are a man and your wife asks you to go shopping, be patient! Because women love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes, music, perfumes...
I am writing to give you the information that was requested in the letter you sent me.
Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be in the second week of July because I will be very busy at any other time for work reasons.
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in a log cabin because I would feel much more comfortable.
One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems with my back.
Finally, the two activities I would like to do while I am camping are Singing and Basketball.
The first one because I think I am good at it and also I love singing loudly with other people.
The last one I have never tried but I think I could play it well because I am very tall and that could make things easier.
I'm very sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I had to make a trip to my parents' house because my mother had an operation; don't worry, she is all right now.
Last month I went to help at a pop concert where Rolling Stones were playing.
It was a wonderful experience but at the same time I had to work very hard.
The things I did were: preparing and checking the equipment, I had to clean all the stadium, making sure that all the lights were in perfect working order, that the singers were comfortable and relaxed, etc.
The most exciting thing was talking with the band, asking them questions and of course listening to the music and enjoying the incredible show.
,,Shopping is not always enjoyable".
From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not.
It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money in our bank account.
Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable.
Luckily, I'm one of these people.
First of all, shopping is a waste of time.
People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy.
During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area.
I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things.
They are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous.
So, as a conclusion, I might say that shopping isn't enjoyable at all and I'd rather stay at home instead.
I have just received your letter of congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need.
First of all, I would like to start with the time of the trip.
I would prefer to go to the Camp in July.
The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August.
As regards accommodation, I would choose to stay in tents.
That is because I am keen on hitchhiking and I am used to living in tents.
It is quite romantic, I think.
As to the activities offered, I would love to go in for swimming and photography while camping, although I am not very good at the last one.
Actually, I would like to take up photography as a hobby and if you can provide me with an opportunity to study in this area, I will accept it with pleasure.
As regards swimming, it is my passion from childhood and I have been going in for this kind of sport for five years now.
Finally, I would like to ask you if you could send me some additional information.
I wonder what kind of clothes I should take with me.
I don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so I am rather puzzled about what to wear there.
Also, I would like to know how much money I will need and which expenses I will have to cover myself.
Subject: to suggest what should be filmed for a short video about the daily life of our school.
The aim of this report is to find out what are the most important things people should see when watching the short video film about the daily routine of our school.
I have conducted a little survey on the subject of my report and I have discovered that most of the pupils of our school think that the region and the area around school should be filmed first.
Personally I agree with their opinion and think that it will be interesting for viewers to learn about the surroundings of the school.
We should film our gardens around the school and the pitch with the courts for volleyball and tennis at the back of the school in the very beginning.
The next things to be shot, according to the majority of students, should be the teaching process and the breaks.
Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better.
Here I should also mention the decor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them.
People should see all the renovations that have been done during the last few years and all the modern conveniences that were installed for both students and teachers.
And as regards breaks, students consider them to be a very important part of school life, despite all the mess and noise.
And the last but not least thing we should include in the film are the outdoor activities, which our students are provided with in our school.
We can the school theatre and its events and also about the sports clubs and their competitions and awards.
In the conclusion of my report I would like to say that the suggestions were made according to the survey conducted among the students of our school.
I hope you will consider this information.
I have safely received your letter bringing the good news.
I wish that I could describe how ecstatic I felt when I found out that I won the competition.
Here I enclose some information which you requested in the letter I received.
I think that the best and most convenient time for me to travel would be in July.
This is because it falls on my holidays and it is also summer in America.
This trip will give me a chance to relax during my holidays, as well as allowing me to gain valuable knowledge and experience.
Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent.
It will let me get up close to nature, and experience life in the wild.
Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.
Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do.
However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best.
I have a lot of experience with swimming and have represented my school before.
As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.
The concert was held in our school hall.
All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work.
I helped to decorate the walls.
My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green.
It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment.
I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls.
This produced a stunning effect during the concert.
I also got to install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
I enjoyed installing the studio equipment in particular.
It gave me a chance to expand my knowledge and gain new skills in electronics.
On the whole, it was a fun experience to work with friends, putting in bulbs, attaching lights and adding speakers.
Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of March.
I am writing to give you some information about myself.
I am very keen on attending Camp California in the U.S.A.
I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this trip only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August.
I've always stayed in tents when I have been on the university camps so I would prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in one.
Considering your activities at the Camp, I would choose singing and painting because I am the lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity.
Also painting is my hobby because I have always painted when I have some spare time.
I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and how much money I should bring.
Once again, thank you for giving me a good opportunity.
I look forward to going to your camp in the near future.
Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable for different reasons and .
Another argument against shopping is the lack of items that you really want.
Sometimes you see a nice dress and you think you are going to buy it tomorrow but when you come back it is sold or there isn't one left in your size.
I cannot imagine anything worse.
The other disadvantage is that you enjoy going shopping too much and pay for everything you buy on your credit card.
When the bill comes to £1000, you will be shocked and regret what you have done.
In conclusion, I believe that shopping is not always enjoyable if you accidentally get into a bad situation or you cannot control your expenditure carefully.
Thank you very much for your letter, which I received yesterday.
I am very happy that I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
Also I am pleased that I don't have to pay any expenses.
I would like to travel at the end of July.
In June I have other arrangements, such as my school exams and my birthday.
The last two weeks of July are convenient for me.
After my school exams I will have time to prepare myself for the trip.
During my time in California, I would love to have the chance to do some leisure activities such as swimming.
It is my favourite sport.
I am good at swimming and fast.
Another sport I love is basketball.
Hopefully I will meet some other girls interested in the same sport.
So we will all play as a team.
My final question is this.
Can you let me know if there are any facilities for washing my clothes? If not I will bring with me enough to last for two weeks.
Please give me a rough idea how much spending money I will need.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
As a housewife I have a good .
Once a week I go shopping.
Sometimes I go twice.
We all have to do our shopping.
It is unavoidable.
Sometimes it is pleasant, and sometimes it's not.
I often shop with no problems, but on Saturday it is not the same.
The shops are so crowded and it takes a long time to find what we want and what we need.
Also we have to face a long queue in order to pay.
It is tiring for some people to spend long hours shopping.
I find it very tiring sometimes.
Shopping is not always enjoyable because we spend money.
Usually we spend much more money than we expect.
We can't do anything about it.
We have to face it - it .
Sometimes shopping is very enjoyable but not every day.
I have just received your letter.
I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply about the camp.
Another consideration was accommodation.
I think it is more comfortable to stay in log cabins than in tents, so I would prefer log cabins.
I would be grateful if you could phone me or send me a letter again at your earliest convenience.
I look forward to the camp in the U.S.A.
'Cry Freedom' is about the blacks and whites of South Africa.
The main characters of this book are Stephen Biko, a black leader, and Donald Woods who is a white newspaper editor.
Woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them.
In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude towards them.
In some ways, he did not agree with "Black Consciousness" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites.
Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live.
The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him.
Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist.
In other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.
I hope you are doing fine.
I am writing this letter to tell you about my experience helping organise a pop concert.
Firstly, you need to know what you are doing.
I spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show.
I could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
The day of the concert, everyone, including the artists and managers were nervous and were tired.
However, when the concert started, we saw that all our efforts had been worthwhile.
The crew and artists thanked the staff.
What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork.
I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all as a big team, working together.
That was what made it really special.
Try it, I recommend it.
I am writing to answer your letter, which I received yesterday.
First of all, I would like to thank you for accepting me and I am very that all expenses are paid .
I can travel only in July because my exams will be finished at the beginning of that month and it would be great if I could set off on my journey on 15th July.
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy, according to the forecast.
Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list.
I have been playing them for more than 3 years, during which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf, by professional coaches.
I enjoy playing both of them regularly.
In addition, it would be nice if you could send me the address at which I am going to stay, so that I can keep in touch with my friends and family.
Finally, thank you again for everything and I am looking forward to accompanying you soon.
"Shopping is not always enjoyable".
I think this statement is true.
In my opinion, shopping is not suitable for children whose ages are under 18! This is quite a strong opinion , but I it from my real-life experiences of shopping.
When I was 15, I was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything I would find now unnecessary.
I would not dare to calculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking.
However, it was not bad.
My mum always told me that I hadn't earned enough money so I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way.
First of all, I want to thank you for this prize.
I am very excited because I have never won a prize.
I have never been to the USA, so I think that this trip will be an unforgettable experience.
Secondly, I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July because in June I have to take my final exams at school.
In August I have to be in Madrid because I am going to work as a trainee in a travel agency.
After August I must return to school, so I can only go to California in July.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like nature very much, and camping, so I think that I will be better in a tent than in a log cabin.
Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis.
I think that I am very good at swimming.
I won a local competition when I was seventeen.
I am not so good at tennis because I began to play only two years ago.
Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and what kind of clothes I have to wear.
Furthermore, I would like to know  I have to take and what amount of money is normally spent in the camp.
I look forward to receiving your reply.
Also, you can spend hours trying to decide between a wonderful blue pair of trousers or a beautiful black dress, for example.
I think that shopping is even more boring when you go with a friend and you have to give her some advice.
It can be a very stressful situation because sometimes you don't know what to say.
In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money on some clothes than you can afford.
I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping.
Despite shopping being boring, I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several items of clothing and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.
Finally, I want to know if I need any money and how much, and if there is a dry cleaners.
We all know what shopping is.
Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes not and overall it is not always enjoyable.
When you go to the supermarket because you want a particular thing and have driven a long time only for that, you look for it but it's not there anymore, you think that shopping is not enjoyable at all.
First of all, I would like to thank you for this prize and the fact that you wrote to me asking for my preferences about the Camp.
Regarding the information you need, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, for work reasons.
Once there, I would prefer staying in a tent, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a Boy Scout and get a break from the routine.
From the list of activities you sent me, I have chosen what are the, from my point of view, most relaxing activities available: painting and photography.
One of my hobbies is photography, so I think I am rather good at it, but I will take painting to learn, because I am not very talented at it.
I also would like to know if I have to take any money and what kind of clothes are suitable for that location.
Please reply me soon.
You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! A couple of months ago, I was told that Britney Spears was coming to perform in our city.
When I knew this, I managed to get a job as one of the kids that prepare the stage before the concert.
I was really excited.
The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the show.
And I didn't even get paid.
But it was worth it.
I got my reward when the concert finished.
After carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was exhausted.
But when Britney came off the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me into her personal dressing room.
We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss.
I won't forget that moment ever.
Write to me soon to tell me your thoughts about what happened to me.
Bye.
I received your letter this morning and I'm very happy about winning first prize.
It's a great opportunity for me to participate in your Camp California because normally I work a lot and I can't spend money on travel.
Moreover, I have to support a big family because I'm married and I have three children.
I would like to travel in July because before then I have to work with my father because he's ill.
For the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because it'll be more comfortable.
I know that I would like to sleep in a tent but at this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed.
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this .
I have to choose painting and photography therefore.
I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think of my health.
In your letter you explain that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life on Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money.
I hope the weather will be good so I suppose I have to bring clothes.
I'm very enthusiastic and I .
In our society money is one of the most important .
If we think about it, we will realise that we need money all day.
Not only for the basic needs but also for the rest of our activities.
There are a lot of people who spend a lot of money because they like shopping.
Sometimes, they have to buy something that they need but, frequently, they buy things only to spend money.
This is a big problem because a lot of families don't have money to spend going shopping.
We have to teach our children the value of money, to explain the difficulties of earning money in a job, because we have to work eight, nine or ten hours a day, for example.
Educating the youngest is a first step and helps our society.
Money is important but we have to know how to spend it: shopping is not always enjoyable.
Thanks for your letter.
I am very happy that I have won the first prize in your competition.
I am looking forward to my holiday, which begins on the first of July lasting until twenty-first July, so it is possible to travel at this time.
I like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since I have done military service, therefore I would prefer a tent as my accommodation.
My favourite activities are swimming and singing.
It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overweight.
I like to sing a song when I am alone.
Singing is good for my .
So I choose singing and swimming as my activities.
I am a beginner at swimming and also at singing.
 I live and I need different products to survive.
I need things to drink and eat.
That is the basic fact that means I must go shopping for food.
It is not enjoyable to see that the price of food is going higher and higher.
My salary is getting lower and lower.
When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of things without considering my money.
Despite having enough money, shopping is not always enjoyable , because I don't know which things I .
Also I will buy things which I don't need.
There are many products the quality of which is bad and because of this the environmental pollution will increase more and more.
It is a fact that shopping is not enjoyable.
Most of the time when we go to the shopping centre we have a lot of fun.
We go to stores to look at clothing, we also eat something like ice cream or French Fries, but is not enjoyable all the time.
In that instance we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping centre.
I'm glad to receive your letter.
I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize.
It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California.
First of all, I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July.
I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is reserved for going with my parents to France.
This was scheduled 3 months ago.
About accommodation, I would prefer the log cabins because I think they are cleaner than the tents.
While I'm staying there I would like to practise tennis and basketball, as I have been playing both sports all my life, and I have to say that I am very good at both.
From my point of view, the real question is: Who said that is enjoyable? Maybe for women, but not for me.
I know that this sounds horrible, but sometimes it's what really happens.
For men, sometimes it is hard to go shopping with their partners.
Sometimes that means a complete tour around all the fashion shops in town.
And of course, we are not allowed to stop in a place that we like, the sports shop.
You cannot waste time because all the other shops could be closed when you arrive.
And that is always what we want.
That's men's intention.
Another point is to go to a big area, especially at weekends.
Everyone pushing a trolley and crashing around.
People should have to get a licence to drive those things.
Someone could be injured.
And of course, the time to pay.
A huge queue that lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out.
In conclusion, for me, to go shopping is not enjoyable at all.
First of all I would like to say thanks for your letter and your concern about your customers.
I was absolutely thrilled to receive the news about my winning a competition.
Your letter contains a few questions about the details of my holiday which I would like to answer for you.
The first is about time.
I am only able to go on holiday in July, because for the rest of the time I have college, which I can't miss.
The second is accommodation.
I would rather stay in log cabins than live in tents.
I don't like cold nights and mosquitoes.
I am so glad that I will get a chance to do activities in the camp.
I play basketball and tennis.
I am quite good at tennis.
.
I played in the school team, and was one of the best players by the end of this season.
There is one more thing which I would like to know about.
It is regarding clothes and money.
Should I have any special clothes? If yes what kind of clothing .
And of course there will be expenses.
Can you inform me how much money I should have and can I have some information about prices of visiting local places of interest.
Finally I would like once more to say thanks for your letter and I look forward to hearing from you by post with all the details about the holiday.
I hate shopping but on the other hand sometimes you can have fun doing it.
In my opinion, it depends on your mood, your financial situation, of course, where you are going to go shopping and what you are going to buy.
Usually people don't have time for shopping.
You've just finished your long hours at work, you are tired, you had a row with your boss but you are still going to go shopping.
And what do you have? There are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
You've got more stress, you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought.
For example, a lot of people do not like to go shopping in big stores.
It takes hours to buy something.
There are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities.
You will have to walk miles around the store to find what you want.
Yes, there is a big plus with a big store of course.
You can find everything in one place, in contrast to the small shops which specialise in one product.
And people spend all weekend walking around shopping centres and high streets in to buy something.
Nowadays technical progress gets close to us, to normal customers.
The Internet is one of the solutions to this problem.
Without any hassle, sitting in your chair in front of your computer, in a second you can get to any shop that has an internet site - most of the big companies have one - get all the information about the product, get a cheaper price and buy it.
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased to hear from you about my winning the competition.
I am writing to inform you of my preferences and ask a few questions about the camping.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I can only take my holiday in July.
I have discussed it with my boss but he allowed me to go on a holiday only in July.
And about accommodation, I would like to stay in a tent.
I know that staying in a log cabin is more convenient but I just want to have a wilder experience.
While I am at the camp, I would like to take part in swimming and photography.
It will be a wonderful experience to swim in a lake and I can relax and enjoy the fresh air.
Photography is one of my hobbies so I want to take as many nice photos as I can in the camp area.
I would like to know about the weather in the camp area because I don't know what kinds of clothes I have to bring.
And I want to know how much money I have to bring for personal expenses.
I also want to know if I can have time for shopping.
I have just received your letter which made me so happy.
I am writing to reply to your questions.
First of all, I can travel only in July because my son's school is going to finish at the end of June, so it is impossible for me to travel during June.
Apart from that, I work in an international tourism agency and August is the busiest month of the year, so July is the best choice for me.
I would rather stay in a tent because I used to go camping when I was a teenager with my family.
I have always loved camping.
My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it.
I have been taking photographs since I was 17.
I took some lessons and after that I really improved .
Besides this, I am very good at playing basketball.
I used to play in the high school team.
I hope all this information will help you.
I am so sorry that I couldn't write to you last week.
As you know, I was very busy and excited about a pop concert which I worked at as a director's assistant during the last week.
First of all, it was a very successful concert and probably you have heard the singer's name before, she is called Tina.
As a director's assistant, my job was the organisation of the audience's seats and tickets.
.
Every day I worked for two hours in a shop selling tickets.
It was quite enjoyable because every day I met different people who like listening to pop music so we had lots of things to talk about.
I also helped with some special requests of the singer which weren't so difficult to arrange.
She was very nice and friendly.
On the night of the concert, I worked as well.
So, that's all my news.
Write back soon.
Thank you for my prize! I have never been to the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California.
I can only have some holiday in July from the 3rd to the 17th with my husband at the same time.
That is why I would like to travel during those two weeks.
Concerning the activities, I have chosen two of them.
I enjoy swimming and any time I have the opportunity to swim I go.
My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that it is better to do one sport and one and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I am unfamiliar with during my holidays.
So, you'd better stay at home today...
I am very happy and excited because I have won first prize in your competition.
It is a pleasure for me.
I am writing to enquire about some and to give the information that you need about me.
I have been working hard here in Portugal and I will be on holiday just next July.
Because of this I believe this is the best time for me to travel You asked me about accommodation at Camp California.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I suppose I will have more contact with natural things than in a log cabin.
Another question that you asked me was about two activities I will have the chance to do there.
I would love to play tennis and basketball, which I've been playing for six years.
About tennis, I just started to play last year and I need to improve my technique a lot.
I would like to know something about money and clothes.
Are they included in the prize? How much money can I spend during this time? I'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can.
I am very happy with your letter that I received last week.
I'm really excited and I have to tell you about a fantastic experience that I had last month.
It was a marvellous concert and there were about 100,000 people there.
I worked as a receptionist in the VIP room and I needed to look very happy all the time, which wasn't very difficult.
You won't believe how many famous people I met.
I met Madonna and could talk with her for ten minutes.
It was a dream and she was amazing .
I didn't tell you, but I helped at this concert just by chance.
A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place.
I said "yes" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life.
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressful situations.
However, those days were unforgettable for me.
I would like to travel in July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have on vacation.
Fortunately, I have heard that the weather is beautiful in California during that month.
I'd rather sleep in a tent because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case.
The best way to go shopping is to think in advance about what you really want to buy and .
If people would think about it BEFORE going shopping, they would not have a headache when they go home and realize they did not want what they bought.
I will be very happy to travel in July because in that month I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permission from my boss.
At the same time, my birthday is in July, so it would be nice to celebrate it there.
I would prefer to stay in a tent, because in that way I can feel closer to nature, and I can remember when I was a girl scout.
Sleeping in a tent is much more exciting and than in a log cabin.
I would like to have more information about the prices of the clothes and souvenirs.
Thank you for giving me this opportunity.
You are never going to believe what I did last month.
I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
We said yes immediately.
I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert.
He is my favourite singer.
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage, doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there.
We were so close to him.
I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind.
I will never forget that day.
Since then, I and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day.
I hope you write to me soon to tell me your opinion.
Thanks for your letter.
I have read the letter and I was very surprised that I have won the first prize.
About the time when I want to travel it can only be in July, because in the summer it is very busy at work.
People whom I work with are going on holiday in June and August.
So they need me at work in those months.
Also, the accommodation I would prefer at Camp California is the log cabin, because first when I was a little child we stayed in a small house every holiday and I like that.
Second, I don't like tents and I can't get used to them, so I prefer log cabins.
About the different activities, we like them all, but If I have to choose two I opt for sailing and tennis.
In the summer I'm sailing in races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes.
I'm not very good at tennis but I can practise on my trip.
Thanks for your letter.
How are you? Everything is fine with me and the pop concert was great.
I enjoyed helping at the pop concert, but it's very stressful work.
You always walk from side to side moving things and there's no break.
Some other work that I did was to lead the people to their places.
We worked the whole day and luckily at least we had some food.
The best things were that we saw famous singers and I spoke with Robbie Williams.
He's friendly and very handsome of course.
If you see the famous singers in the flesh they are different and most singers haven't any time for you.
Another thing I did was the make-up but only for about fifteen minutes.
That was very nice, because I didn't expect that.
There were some people who gave me some advice about cleaning the face etc.
Finally, it was a very nice day and a great experience.
I am writing to inform you about your question.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because before then I don't have time to travel.
I have to finish my studies.
Secondly, I want to stay in a log cabin.
I think it is more convenient than in tents.
And I would like to have a chance to do painting and photography.
I am not so fit and healthy, so I don't like to do exercise.
However, drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me.
I hope so very much.
Do you like shopping? Generally many women like shopping, including me.
Even the young girl wants to go shopping with mum.
However, whenever you go shopping, are you usually satisfied with your choice and do you always enjoy shopping? Perhaps you have an unpleasant experience.
You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store.
Then you could find the cheapest goods and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly.
Moreover if you bought something then you could find it is a little bit more expensive than the other shop.
Both cases often happen with shopping.
If you don't want to regret shopping, you have to make a shopping list first before going shopping.
Then you should check the price and the quality of the goods.
If you remember these two things at least, you could enjoy the shopping.
One more thing I recommend you is to leave your credit card at home if you are only going window shopping.
You have sent me a letter about the competition and the first prize I have won.
You asked me for some further information.
First, I'd like to travel in July at any time from the first to the 30th because of my vacation period.
I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare myself.
Second, I'd prefer to have a log cabin where I could store some things.
This book remains one of the best in American literature .
It is classed as one of the ten books that should be in your own library.
But it is also the most famous short story by Ernest Hemingway.
Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it is a deep reflection on age.
A veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men that he is still able to do it.
Then, Hemingway paints a marvellous description of fishing and of the great fight between the fish and the old man.
The 24-hour fight is described in such a peaceful, faithful way that it .
I recommend this book as a way to discover both Hemingway and American literature.
I have been asked to say when I would like to travel.
There's only one month for that: July (as I am working all the year round and I am not available to leave my job).
About the accommodation, I think I would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable.
During my two weeks at Camp California, I'd like to practise climbing and surfing, the basics of which I know perfectly well.
In addition to this, I would like to know the amount of money I should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that I could need and the sort of people that I will find there.
It has been so long since I wrote to you last time...
None of the groups are known at the moment, but I believe they are well on their way to becoming famous bands.
My tasks were serving drinks and some other stuff, and staying there after the concert to clean everything.
This was the best part because when everyone was gone, Billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!! What was a guy like that doing in such a place? I couldn't believe my eyes...
Jane took a photograph of us together.
I'll send you a copy as soon as I can.
When I received your letter, I was very surprised and happy because I don't remember entering this competition.
First I can travel only in July because I will finish school at the end of June and I will sit my exam in September; so I have to revise for it a lot during the month of August.
To answer your second question, I choose to sleep in a tent because I like to sleep outside.
I have tried golf twice.
I'm really bad but I hope to make much progress quickly.
I have never tried surfing, but every time I see surfing on television I find it magical.
I'm sorry I can only write now because last week I had too much work.
As you asked me I will tell you about the pop concert last month.
With my friend Miko I looked for a little weekend job and one evening we met a guy who wanted to sell drinks at the pop concert and so we told him that we agreed to help him at the bar.
I particularly liked seeing all those people, and I met a lot of new friends there.
For next year we are searching for a new barwoman.
.
I would like to travel only in July because I would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter.
I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip, which would be annoying?! And when the sun is shining you are relaxed and you feel good.
.
I would prefer a tent to sleep in at Camp California because it is fun to sleep in tents and to compare it to sleeping in a house.
You are in communication with nature and you can hear the insects.
And we only need to sleep and not to cook or watch T.V...
It is very nice to stay in tents which are strong and comfortable.
You can hesitate before choosing an item.
Which is the best thing to get? The shop assistant can be not very nice and watch you all the time.
You don't find the item in your size or the right colour.
The item can be too expensive.
It looks fragile and it could break easily.
You must try several shops and compare the price and the quality of the items.
So you must walk all day or go by car.
And the weather must be fine if you walk in town.
I am very glad that I have won first prize in your competition and I can go to the United States.
It has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country.
Now my dream will come true.
I will try to give you some information about me.
The best time to travel for me is July because I am working and only then can I have holidays.
I would be pleased if it is possible.
About accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I would like to try it.
It will be very interesting for me because normally I do not have a lot of time to do activities.
I would prefer swimming because I really like it and I am trying to swim whenever I have got some time, and painting because I have finished a painting course and I have some practice with this.
That is very nice that all costs are paid for but I would like to ask you how much money I should take with me because I do not know anything about prizes in the U.S.A.
and please tell me if I need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if I will need to take everything I will just change this activity.
Thank you for the letter and I am looking forward to an answer.
Thank you for answering my last letter, I hope your sister's health is better than last time and she is all right.
My life is a little bit changed after that concert last month.
I will try to explain to you why.
As you know I was helping to make all the decorations before and during the concert.
It was a really wonderful new experience for me.
I have never before met so many people and I didn't now that is so hard to keep everything in order during a concert.
Now I know that everything needs patience, time and hard work before someone sings any record on stage.
The people were wonderful, they were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do.
It is a very nice feeling when you need help and there are so many people who want to help you.
I will never forget this concert and those people.
It was good experience which I will never forget.
I hope I will be able to do it again.
This is just a note to confirm for you that I have received your letter.
I am so happy to have won the first prize in your competition.
I will be happy to be for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I understand from your letter that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for me, including transport to and from the airport.
To answer your questions, I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July, because I will be studying for the Cambridge exam till 1 July.
Would it be possible to have at Camp California in a tent, because I haven't had a chance to sleep in one.
And would it be possible to do swimming and surfing.
I am very good at swimming.
I have been doing it for as long as I can remember.
At surfing I am not good at all.
I have been dreaming about this activity since I was 10 years old.
I would like to know how many people will stay with me in the tent, and do I have to take with me any special clothes for surfing.
I will contact you, if I have more questions.
I look forward to being at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I like shopping.
I love to go shopping.
But only if I have money!! Or some money.
Shopping can't be enjoyable if you don't have money to spend.
It is better to stay at home and read a good book.
I think going shopping in a big space like Harrodss is not a pleasure, because it's crowded with people.
I like to be in small boutiques, and I would rather go shopping during the weekend .
.
And going shopping after the weekend is not for me.
I don't know what more I can tell you.
I'm sorry.
Drop me a line or give me a call if my writing is not so good for you because I'll be out next week.
And I'll miss your lessons.
I am sending you this reply with the information that you need.
I would like to travel in July because I am a student so I only have holidays in this part of the year.
About the accommodation, I would like to stay in a log cabin because I am used to staying in them when I travel.
The activities that I want to do at the camp are Basketball and Surfing.
Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall and I used to play it very well.
On the other hand I know almost nothing about surfing but I would like to learn and to do the sport because I think it is cool.
There is one thing I would like to ask you.
It's about how much money I will need to go out at night, to spend on food and that kind of thing.
There are people that love going shopping.
They live, work and only think about it.
They are addicted to buying things.
Some doctors say that shopping without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsive shopper.
He can't stop buying things.
He spends all his money buying things that he sometimes doesn't use.
I think this is one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.
Sometimes, shopping can be really boring, especially on important dates when the shops are absolutely crowded and you can't see anything you wanted .
I received your letter this morning.
Thank you very much for your kind letter and for choosing me.
I can only travel in July because I have already booked and fully paid for a holiday , from 25th July till the end of August.
If you can arrange my departure time for 1st of July it would be convenient for me.
I would like to stay in a tent, because I had many great times in tents during my previous holidays, if it can be arranged.
I want to do these two activities while I am at the camp: sailing and photography.
I have great experience of sailing.
I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey.
And I have a certificate in using a radio (VHF).
I have knowledge of navigation, engine , ropes and knots, and sails as well.
My other passion is photography, I especially like black and white photography.
I have a camera, it is a Minolta X300.
It is a manual camera.
I know how to develop films and print photographs.
I am not sure about clothes, money and the immigration rules of the USA.
Please could you tell me what the weather is like there, what kind of clothes I need and how much money I should bring.
Yours sincerely.
I like shopping but I had a bad experience on a recent shopping trip.
I went out to get some shopping and to get some ideas about new computers and products.
First of all, I went to a local shop but they didn't have a big enough selection of products.
Then I visited another one, in Cambridge Street.
It was very crowded, I could hardly move in the shop.
I decided to buy a CD-ROM drive for my old computer.
When I approached the cashier I suddenly noticed my wallet had gone.
My money, travel card and credit card had gone.
It was a nightmare, there were pickpockets in the shop.
I went to the shop's customer services but it was useless.
As soon as possible, I phoned my bank to cancel my credit card but they had already used it.
It cost me about £500.
This experience has changed my shopping habits, now I do all my shopping on the Internet.
But I'm not sure whether it is safe.
But you must always be on your guard against pickpockets.
I have received your letter, which makes me happy.
The first time in my life I have won a competition.
I would like to take you up on your invitation in July.
I am only able to take my holiday in July.
The rest of the year I work.
I would prefer to stay in a tent.
I think it is more enjoyable.
I don't know why but I have my childhood.
When I was a kid I used to ask my mum to buy me a tent for my bedroom so I would be able to sleep in there instead of my bed.
I'm crazy about tennis and swimming.
I used to take tennis and swimming lessons when I was in high school.
I have .
I go swimming and play tennis.
.
Shopping is part of our life.
I don't like shopping.
Can you Friday night? Most people get paid on Friday night then they go shopping.
I can't stand in long queues.
You have worked hard all day.
On the way home you want to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to wait ten minutes on average.
It is not good.
Your time has been stolen.
I can't cope with that.
I prefer to go home without any milk.
There are a lot of tills in the shop but most of them are closed.
It is annoying.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I was really surprised and very happy when I read that I have won the first prize, first of all because I have never been to California and second because it's the first time I have ever won something.
The only time that it is possible for me to travel is July, because I am working for a bank and this is the only month I can go on holiday.
For my stay in California I would prefer because this gives me a feeling of freedom and adventure and it is quite different to my life here in Greece.
The activities I would like to do most are climbing and surfing.
In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say that I am quite good at climbing.
But I have never 'surfed' in my life, so that is an activity I have to .
And what about money? How much money should I take with me? Are there any activities which are not included? And my last question: how many people are going to stay in each tent.
Many people, especially women, love shopping.
If you go to the centre of any big town you will see people walking from store to store searching for something to wear or to buy to eat.
But shopping is not always enjoyable.
First of all because of the great variety in the store, very often you don't know what to buy because we don't have only three or four different sports shoes to choose from, no, we have to choose out of twenty or thirty such as Nike, Adidas or Fila.
Another problem is that shops and stores are often overcrowded.
Very often you can hardly move because of the crowds of people.
And many people are in a hurry, so don't be surprised if other people do not have the tolerance and patience to wait and hit you with their shopping trolleys.
Of course there are a lot of other reasons why shopping isn't always great fun, but the last reason, which is very important for me, is that shopping is becoming more and more impersonal.
That means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to.
That is the most important reason why I only like to go shopping in small stores, where I have peace and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.
Thank you very much for awarding me the first prize - Camping in California.
I really look forward to it because I have never been to the U.S.A.
before.
I would like to have my two weeks with you in July, as it will be during my summer holiday.
In addition to that, it is said to be the best season there.
I will join in with the swimming group and the photography group.
Both of them are my hobbies.
I have won some prizes in my school competitions in them.
Therefore, I am quite confident about them.
I would be grateful if you could put me into the because I have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels .
I would like to try it this time.
As all the travel expenses are paid already, I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothing and also how much pocket money I need.
The concert I helped at last week was the greatest experience I've ever had.
I mainly gave them a hand in setting up the stage.
You know, although I'm a pop music fan, I'd never had any idea how .
First, they asked me to put those instruments on the stage.
I left the on the left side (it should have been on the other side).
Before his opening, the pop star noticed the mistake.
Otherwise it would have been a disaster.
The performer, Paul, is a big name at the present.
But I'd never seen him before.
This time, I saw him in person.
I told him I loved his songs.
He was very happy.
Then, we had a lovely conversation.
Afterwards, he gave me his pen for my enthusiasm.
Anyway, how are you? Write soon.
Tell me how you're getting on in your new job.
I am writing to you to thank you for the prize you're giving me.
This is the first time in my life that I won anything like that.
When I received your letter, I could not believe it.
I am glad to reply to your letter.
Unfortunately, I will only be able to go in July because the restaurant where I am working will be closed for that month.
My last holiday in a tent I had a very bad experience, the mosquitoes nearly killed me.
I would prefer a log cabin.
With reference to the activities, I have never been climbing.
I would like to try this sport.
I am a lover of danger sports.
I am a really good singer.
I enjoy karaoke a lot.
I am in doubt as to what kind of clothes I have to bring with me.
And may I also ask you how much money I have to take with me.
Please, if you could help me with this I would be very glad.
You cannot imagine what I've been up to.
I had the best experience in my life.
The company I work for works for Los Svaves.
It's a very famous from my country.
Can you guess who they chose for the job, "me", yes, me, I couldn't believe it.
I went just to one concert.
My job basically was to, , make everything ready.
I got used to doing it very quickly.
To be honest the most exciting part of all this was getting to know the group.
The singer is a very nice guy, as are the rest of the group.
If this happens again I'll write to you to tell you more.
I am writing in reply to your letter.
I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I have got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a tent because it is more appropriate to a camp.
And regarding the activities, I must choose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things.
Finally I just want to ask you what kind of clothes I have to bring with me, and approximately how much money do you think I will need? Thank you very much for everything.
Here I am, writing to you to tell you everything about my wonderful experience at the concert.
You can't imagine how much I enjoyed that .
I started early in the morning, helping to carry stuff from the trucks to the place where the band played.
I helped with the musical stuff like speakers, mics, lights, sound equipment, etc.
And later the band arrived and played two or three times before the concert started.
And I helped them fix the last details.
When the concert started, I was preparing some drinks for the band because after the concert they would be very tired and thirsty.
After the concert I only helped tidy up the place and made sure that everything was under control and clean.
Later the band was talking to me, I could get their new album free, and some other souvenirs from the band.
But the thing that I particularly liked was that I could do all kinds of things just in one day and I could feel different emotions.
So, that's everything that I can tell you.
I enjoyed it a lot and I hope to have another experience like this.
I am writing to you to give you the information you need about me.
But also I would like to thank you for the very nice prize.
Here is some of the information: I would like to travel in July because the school year ends then and I will be able to go on vacation.
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I can't sleep outside in a tent.
I would be very pleased if I could basketball and swimming.
I am very good at basketball and I play in my school team.
I know how to swim and dive from high places.
I am very keen on both sports.
Of course there are some things that I would like to ask you.
If possible, I would like to know what kind of clothes I should take with me, and how much money I will need to have with me.
I had a really great time working with all the pop singers and dancers and .
I even met some very interesting people with whom I became really good friends.
What I liked the most was working with the singers, teaching them how to dance and follow some steps.
This was an experience I'll never forget.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you very, very soon.
Thank you for the letter.
I was very pleased when I knew that I had won the first prize.
I would like to go there only in July, please, because I have a holiday in July.
For accommodation I would prefer log cabins because they are more comfortable than tents.
And I don't have to worry about the weather.
For two activities, regarding the first one, can I do Tennis, please, because I'm very good at tennis.
I used to play a lot when I was a student.
The second one, can I do Photography, please, because this is my hobby.
And my dad just bought me a new camera.
So this will be my first chance to use it.
Thank you very much for your offer.
I hope to hear from you.
Thanks for the letter asking about the pop concert.
It was really good.
I'm glad I went.
My responsibilities were selling the tickets and making sure that everything was alright.
It was good to work with a lot of people and to share experiences.
I met a lot of famous pop bands for the first time.
I would feel sad if I hadn't gone there.
They gave me a concert T-shirt.
I'll show you my photographs.
 also some of them were old friends from college.
So we still keep in touch.
And the next concert we were promised we'll be there again.
I wish you had been there with us.
Because sometimes you .
Anyway, I will send you some photographs.
I hope to hear back from you.
Take care and don't work too hard.
Please give my love to your family.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I appreciated this big news.
Please, let me tell you my answer now.
First, I would like to travel during July.
This is because my college will finish at the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August.
Second, I prefer to stay in a log cabin.
I usually stay in a tent during camping.
Actually, I don't like tents so much.
Therefore, I am interested in staying in a log cabin.
Third, I chose painting and golf as activities.
I learned painting when I was a school student.
In particular, I like water painting.
Also, I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan.
Finally, I would like you to advise me about clothes and pocket money, which I will take.
Thanking you for your time.
In particular, I prefer to go to department stores.
They are heaven! I can spend all day in there.
In fact, they have many kinds of products which make me happy.
To be honest, I don't always buy these products, but I can be satisfied with just looking at them.
Some people don't like to go shopping with a friend who takes a long time to decide.
Even in this case, shopping is fun for me.
I believe there are a lot of ways to enjoy shopping.
By the way, shopping is a sort of therapy.
I sometimes go shopping when I have stress.
Shopping helps me to cheer up every time.
I think many people, especially women, have the same experience.
But the most important thing to enjoy shopping is not to spend all the money which you have.
I am writing in reply to your letter.
I am absolutely delighted with the news.
It really took me by surprise, this prize.
I didn't think I would be so lucky as to win.
First of all, about your enquiries, the only time suitable for me to travel is in July.
The reason is that my academic year starts in August therefore I need to be here.
Secondly, I would rather stay in a tent.
There's no further reason than that it would be a new experience for me and I'm very excited about it.
I am very keen on photography so I definitely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp.
The other thing I'd love to do is sailing.
I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love water sports and their challenges.
Finally I'd like to ask you some questions, which are mainly about small details.
I am not sure whether I will need some special clothes.
If not what sort of clothes should I bring, and also how much money roughly will I need for my daily expenses.
I would be very grateful for your help and advice in these matters.
My dear friend, I hope you are very well and just as happy as I am.
You must remember me telling you about the pop concert.
Well now that it's over I have time to tell you everything about it.
The concert was a huge success.
Lots of people came and enjoyed the music.
I am very proud of myself because of the way I managed the whole experience, although there were moments when I thought I wasn't going to be able to cope with all the pressure, especially when the musicians arrived.
They can be very demanding people and sometimes they come up with very odd requests.
For example once they wanted mineral water of a certain French label which was impossible to get.
My tasks were very specific.
I had to help with the layout of the stage, which was very complicated, because there are so many cables, and things going on at the same time.
After that part was fully functioning I moved on to work backstage.
I really enjoyed working with those people.
They are all very professional although they may look a bit eccentric sometimes.
However, what I liked the most about it was seeing so many people dancing, jumping and enjoying frenetically something that I had been part of and helped to make happen.
Thank you for the letter you have sent recently.
It was a surprise to learn that I won the first prize.
The reason I am really writing, however, is to give you some details about my trip to California.
In the letter you said that the accommodation provided can be either a tent or a log cabin.
I would prefer to stay in a tent so that I will have the chance to be in contact with nature as well as the scenery around the camp.
The activities I would like to choose from the activity list are singing (because I belong to a choir at school) and photography.
I'm really good at taking pictures.
It's a way I have to express my feelings.
I wonder if you could send me more information about what kind of clothes we have to bring.
Do you think you could also let me know how much money we will need during our stay at the Camp.
What a surprise it was to get a letter from you after all this time.
Sorry I haven't written for so long but I was really busy trying to apply for a job.
This is just to let you know with whom I worked.
In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city, the County Council organised an open air concert.
It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend.
The pop band "Five" arrived in town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also with building the stages and sound.
I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager.
I couldn't believe it when he said: "O.K., if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do." My job was to leave some leaflets in shops, restaurants and on the streets.
Working with this band was an experience I will never forget.
What I really enjoyed was being part of the staff.
Although I was very nervous, I knew I could do the job well.
I'd love to hear all your news.
Why don't you come and visit me? Perhaps I could show you the pictures I took.
Thank you very much for the prize.
I am writing this letter to inform you that I have received your letters and I am going on the trip.
I would like to go on the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students.
The other reason is, I think in July the weather is not so cold.
The weather conditions will be suitable for camping.
I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabin because sleeping in a tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to nature.
Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice environment outside the tent.
Also, staying in a tent is more comfortable.
I'll have to be careful about insects so I've bought so many insect repellants.
I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and go swimming.
When I was in the fourth form, I got the first prize in a swimming competition and third prize in tennis.
I was a bit disappointed with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or second prize.
Lastly, I would like to ask you some questions.
First, how many clothes do I have to bring? And do I have to bring some money? It would be very kind of you if you could answer my questions.
Hi! How are you? I am fine and I hope you're fine too.
I have an interesting story to tell you.
I've been asked to the well-known band Westlife.
At first I was surprised but a few seconds later, when I realised that I wasn't allowed to go, I tried to persuade my teacher to let me go.
Eventually, she allowed me to go.
I had to help them behind the stage, while they were getting dressed.
I had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly.
Although the work was not hard, I gained a lot of experience.
They gave me their autographs and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the stage and dance with them.
I was really embarrassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had.
I really enjoyed the concert.
The thing that I particularly liked about the concert was I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert, which is another well-known band.
I really want to have that experience again.
That is my story.
Tell me yours.
I want to know what experiences you had when you were in England.
I think I would like to travel only in July because I'll have just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holiday .
It will be very nice for me.
When I am at Camp, I will choose singing and photography.
I can sing classical music and pop music, like rock & roll.
Maybe TITANIC.
My mum likes me singing this song.
And I can also take very good photographs, because I learned to do this in China two years ago.
Another thing is I would like to ask you some questions about the stay.
What's the weather like? What kind of clothes shall I take? And how much does it cost per night to stay in a Hotel? Thanks for your help.
A lot of people enjoy shopping very much.
Me too.
But sometimes shopping is not very enjoyable.
Another thing is when you shop on a busy street, like Oxford St in London, a lot of thieves are there.
They will steal your money.
That's so dangerous.
So, in my opinion shopping is not really enjoyable all the time for me.
This will stop when I get a good job.
Maybe I will feel better and enjoy it.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I'm very surprised to win this prize.
About the information, I would like to travel in July because it's only the month when I have a vacation.
It's very difficult to change it.
About the accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer tents because I like the countryside and I like to listen to the birds.
At the camp I would like to play tennis and golf.
My level in these two activities is medium.
I never them both.
I would like to ask you some questions.
Thank you again for this first prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I'm very happy.
I am amazed about the prize in your competition.
I am looking forward to going to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information.
About accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a tent because it will be a new experience for me.
I like to have new experiences, especially when I am on holiday.
I am pleased to have the opportunity to do sports as well.
I am good at swimming and playing tennis.
In my opinion shopping is a very good that gives you more opportunities to enjoy yourself.
I don't understand why men don't like shopping, at least they say that they don't.
Despite the fact that I love shopping I have to agree that it is not "always" enjoyable.
Sometimes you go out and you can't find something special or there are a lot of people there.
It's annoying.
You shouldn't go shopping when the shops are so busy because it's so annoying.
If you want to buy a Christmas present buy it some days before Christmas.
Another point is that now you don't need to go out shopping.
You can buy a lot of products over the Internet.
In conclusion I think there are boring times and enjoyable times when you are shopping but for me there are more enjoyable than boring times.
I was so happy when I found out that I won first prize in your competition.
I hope that it will be a good gift for me from your organization.
You asked me when I would like to travel? I would like to travel only in July because in August I must go to my grandmother's and help her to gather a harvest of fruit.
I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent.
And with the tent I can go to another place in the camp.
When it rains it is not comfortable, but I like it.
I want to do activities like basketball, because I think it is a teenager's game.
And I like painting because I like to paint nature, sea, mountains.
I often go to exhibitions of paintings of modern artists.
But I like different styles of art.
I think I'll enjoy this trip.
I want to know some information about it.
Yours sincerely Gubin.
I abolutely agree with this, because I have my own experience of shopping.
For example, recently I was shopping at the market, which is located in the centre of our town.
And what do you think? When I was there I saw a very beautiful T-shirt.
I asked my mother to buy it.
But my mother said: "I haven't enough money to buy it".
I was upset about it.
Our government is very bureaucratic.
Our ministers are really criminal.
They often break the law, stealing money.
For example, Paul Kozin stole 800000000 dollars.
Because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites.
In our country there is a high number of unemployed.
Often people can't buy a piece of bread.
And they ask for money from other people.
My parents can't buy me .
Each man thinks only about himself.
The quality of life is very low.
I am writing with reference to your letter about the competition I won, in which you requested some additional information.
I am very happy to have won a two-week trip to Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work.
Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip.
As I am an expert camper, I would prefer to be put up in a tent rather than in a log cabin.
Concerning activities at the camp, I would be highly delighted if I could play basketball and tennis.
The former because I am an excellent basketball player and the latter because I am interested in taking up a new sport and I am a complete beginner at it.
I am a little unsure about some things and I would be very grateful to you if you could answer my questions.
I would like to know if I will need to take some special clothes and how much money would I need to bring with me.
After our English class's decision to make a short film about daily life in my school, I have been asked to write a report about interesting lessons and activities that should be filmed.
The aim of this report is to inform my teacher about them.
Here are my findings.
As all the students are different from each other, it is essential to show many aspects of the school.
Therefore, to show the good aspects, I suggest filming Mr.
Clark's English classes, because they are highly educational and because the students participate a lot.
On the other hand, to show less pleasing aspects, it would be sufficient to film Mrs.
Morrison's French classes, as they are extremely boring and sub-standard.
One event that should not be missed is the weekly football game between teachers and students, which shows how well they get along with each other.
Another event that should definitely be captured on film is the preparation of the meals in the canteen.
The cooks are very friendly and excellent.
In conclusion, I suggest that our English class seriously takes into consideration my suggestions when making the video.
Because the above mentioned events are the ones most praised or criticised by all students.
I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy about winning the competition.
I believe I have the appropriate qualifications to stay two weeks at camp California.
It would be wonderful to see you as soon as possible.
First of all, I will be able to travel in July only because I have not finished school.
 in a tent.
I had experience of this last summer.
Secondly, I am very keen on sports, specially sailing and swimming.
Anyway I am working hard at sailing for the world cup.
Finally, I would like to know how the weather is in July? Because I have to prepare all my luggage and I am sure it will be a great experience despite .
I look forward to hearing from you.
Hi, how are you? I'm fine.
Thank you for my birthday present.
 I was responsible for checking tickets at the entrance, then I had to give a seat to everyone.
Anyway I enjoyed it so much.
I haven't been to a concert before so the atmosphere was really good.
I won't forget my experience in my whole life.
Do you remember the computer course that we took together.
It was very useful to classify each person at the concert.
So keep in touch.
I enjoyed a lot participating in your competition and hope to enjoy the trip I have won.
To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only at the end of June.
For accommodation at Camp California I prefer a tent because I have been camping for years and enjoy it very much.
As I have a chance to do 2 activities while I am at the Camp, I will choose singing, which I am very good at, and swimming, which I am fond of but, unfortunately, not a professional.
Finally I would like you to tell me if I should take some special clothes and also what sum of money I will need...
during my vacation.
A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men in the world would never believe that in my opinion shopping is really not always enjoyable.
In particular, I can't bear to go shopping with my mother: it takes so much time that later I regret agreeing to go with her.
When I am on my own, everything is fine: I do my shopping quickly because I never have to spend hours choosing what I really want either for myself or someone else.
Shopping is a personal art and everybody has his own way of doing it.
Some go just to kill time; others to look at something new.
I am in the third group - beforehand I think of what I will buy and go straight to the department I need.
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day with my mother looking through a huge department-store.
I am writing to answer your invitation which I have received as a first prize winner.
I would be really delighted to visit Camp California in the U.S.A.
for two weeks.
This would be an ideal opportunity for me to visit the United States to learn about the American way of life.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my holiday only in July.
Secondly, I'd prefer to stay in tents.
That would be the first chance for me to sleep on the outskirts of California.
It could be very enjoyable.
And I would like to choose as my activities Golf and painting.
I used to play Golf several years ago and I like to paint .
Last, I have no experience of travelling abroad.
Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California in July.
Which clothes should I take? Maybe there are some occasions when I have to pay for myself.
As mentioned above, please to give me more information, and if you'd like to know more, please telephone me for further discussion.
It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million.
I went to school there for twelve years.
Many people say: "When you have a son, send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance of the best opportunity.
There are all kinds of facilities which you can imagine.
Most of the people like to go to the centre of the City, that's Meong-Dong where the underground arcade is and several businesses have their headquarters there.
There are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where I can taste my favourite foods.
If I go to visit my family in Korea, I usually walk along the Meong-Dong streets, and enjoy window shopping.
But there is always a lot of traffic at all times, and the air is so polluted that I can't even breathe.
I always feel very tired after the shopping because of unfriendly people who are too busy.
I was very happy when your letter arrived, yesterday.
This trip will be very important for me.
That is why I am interested in travelling to the U.S.A as soon as possible.
I would like to travel in July because I will be on my winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school.
I would really prefer to stay in a tent because I love sleeping outdoors and listening to the noises from outside.
I look forward to receiving more news.
Hello! How are you? I'm writing because I know that you're interested in hearing about my experience when I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month.
Perhaps in the future you'll be able to help too.
If you want to help at a pop concert you'll have to write about yourself in a competition as I did, then, if you win the organiser will phone you and you'll be able to help them.
At the concert I had to and organize all the people who were there, but at the end of the night I was able to talk with one of my favourite pop singers.
I think that was the experience I liked most and which I will never forget.
According to your letter, I should tell you when I would like to travel and I think July is the best time for me because I will be on summer vacation so I would not have to miss any classes.
About the accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I enjoy the contact with nature as well as camping activities.
As I may choose the two activities I would like to do during my stay at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography.
I have been taking singing lessons since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it.
On the other hand, I am a beginner at photography skills.
I would appreciate it if you could inform me if I have to bring any money for extra costs or even any special kind of clothes for those activities.
These days people are shopping more often than they used to.
Sometimes shopping can be a stressful experience though people think of it as an enjoyable part of their lives.
First of all, shopping can be a good thing if it is a chance to forget about all the problems you have, even if it is just for a moment.
It relieves you from the pressure of life while you are looking for something to buy.
On the other hand, sometimes you can get really irritable shopping, like when you have to deal with unhelpful shop assistants.
It is a very common phenomenon these days and you have to be patient if you really want to buy something.
Furthermore, sometimes you do not find a variety of goods and you eventually buy a low quality product.
In conclusion, like all things in life, shopping can be pleasant or irritating depending on your patience and on your mood that day.
I received your letter and I am very excited about the camp.
I would like to go in July, I don't mind which two weeks, but it has to be that month because in June I am still in school and in August I am going on holiday with my family.
I would prefer to sleep in a tent because I think it's different from where I sleep every night so I would appreciate it if there are still tents available.
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing.
I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better at it.
The other activity I would like to do is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been playing for four years.
I would like to know what type of clothes I should take and also if I need to take any money with me.
Thanks for your attention.
Hello girl, how are you doing these days? I have been great, especially last weekend at the Backstreet Boys concert.
It was so exciting.
They were giving two concerts, one on Friday and the other one on Saturday.
They invited me to go on Friday.
This is what happened: when I arrived they told me that I was helping backstage with the scenery; then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes, then they had to go on stage.
Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the curtains (opening and closing) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him.
My heart started beating very hard.
The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys.
I had a great time that day.
Well I have to go now.
Hope to hear from you later .
First, I want to say how happy I am to have won this prize and I want to thank you.
Concerning the information you want, I will give it.
I would like to travel in July because this is the only month off given to me by my employer.
I would prefer to have a log cabin because I cannot sleep in a tent (it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back).
Concerning the two activities I have to choose, I would prefer to swim and play tennis (I have a good level of proficiency in each sport).
Finally I would like to know how much money I have to bring and what sorts of clothes are usually worn in California.
Many classes and activities are important in our school.
But I have to make a choice in order to select from among them.
The engineering class seems to be the most important lesson.
It uses a lot of techniques that we learn in other classes.
It gives us knowledge useful for many school clubs, like the "marathon shell" club or the robotics club.
Besides it all the areas covered by a mechanical engineer and it is very important in a school where you will probably become a mechanical engineer.
It lets us identify our abilities and the part of mechanics that we prefer.
But there are other very important lessons (like English of course!) Actually, I have a regret - there is no ethics lesson.
It would show us how to use our knowledge.
I am writing to you to give you the information you need, but first of all I want to say that I am really delighted and I would like to thank you.
Third, you need to know which sport I want to to do.
I would choose photography and tennis.
In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera...
(I guess that you shouldn't borrow one!) Regarding tennis, I have played for eight years and I used to enter competitions.
Our engineering school is specialised in mechanics and thermodynamics.
Needless to say, we must turn our attention to these fields.
First, we could film the fluid mechanics lessons and the general mechanics lessons.
I wonder if we could not of the laboratories, in which we could show a student doing experiments.
In order to impress people who will watch the film, we could film a student drawing on the big drawing tables.
I would do the same for thermodynamics.
Nevertheless, we should not forget the extra-curricular life at school.
We have to show sports at school and all the activities that we are offered.
It is not only the brain which should be trained.
Future students could appreciate coming if they could still do their sport.
Another would be the time we have got between lessons or at lunch time.
It will show a part of the way of life in the school.
If you want further information or if you disagree, tell me about it.
Our school, as is well known, is a technical school and consequently its daily life consists of different activities performed in the classrooms or in the laboratories.
A short video, shown to the English class, must take into account all these aspects of the life of our school.
Here we can describe some lessons or other activities which can be filmed for the video.
The maths lessons are divided in two parts: the theoretical one where the definitions and the theorems are presented to students and the numerical one where the problems are solved and the applications are explained.
Two particular activities are performed in the physics laboratory and the chemistry laboratory.
In the former some of the most important physical laws are experimentally verified by the students with the help of an assistant.
In the latter many chemical reactions may be reproduced to show to the students the resulting effects and the final compounds generated.
These activities are very interesting and they will surely be included in the video.
Moreover, many sports activities are performed in our school: swimming, tennis, gym, jogging and so on.
Some parts of the final video may show these additional features of the school.
I am writing to reply to your letter about the holiday at Camp California in the U.SA which is the first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month.
First of all, I want to know if it is possible to travel in July because during that month I will be free from the school's activities and my parents only let me go if I do not have to miss any of my classes.
About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been doing it for 5 years so I want to keep at it.
The other activity that I chose is painting.
I am not as good as I want, nevertheless I think I can improve my skills during this course.
I would rather have a tent than a log cabin for my accommodation because last summer I had the great opportunity to in a log cabin and now I want to know what the other option .
I am sure it will be thrilling to stay close to nature and, at the same time, it would be a new experience for me.
I would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so I can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing I need to know is the amount of money that I have to bring with me.
If you need more information, please do not hesitate to write to me.
To make this report easier and faster , it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
1- It would be a good idea to film the computer centre, the room and the library because, as everybody knows, they have very good equipment and also they are comfortable places that help the students to improve their English on their own.
2 - They also think that through filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as "one-to-one" lessons, people who see this video will become interested in knowing more about the school, because few English schools have this sort of class.
3 - Last but not least, a lot of students (almost 85%) think that the extra-curricular activities organised by the social programme have become really exciting.
So they suggest filming these activites during the weekend, for example "the full day in Oxford" because those who did not have the opportunity to go there could see how great it was and then they can attend the next time.
However, 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
As you can see, my classmates and almost everybody in the school are happy with the facilities and activities that we have.
Despite there being almost 300 students, the answers were quite similar.
I do recommend paying attention to the food in the cafeteria because, even though it was not the main subject of this report, they also wrote to complain about it.
If you need more information or the sheets that I collected, please do not hesitate to ask me for them.
I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going on this trip.
Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions.
I would like to travel in July, as it will be summer, and the weather will be nicer.
Accommodation log cabins would be better for me, because they are more comfortable.
Many people enjoy going shopping, meeting friends and mainly spending their money, but sometimes shopping can be a terrible experience.
The good side of this activity is that it can be , provided you are not in a hurry.
On the other hand, when the shops are crowded (for instance, just before Christmas), going shopping can be very stressful, as you cannot walk and have to endure endless queues.
Another problem is the shortage of trolleys in supermarkets, which is very common when they are full of people.
As if this were not enough, there are always impolite assistants, who make your day even worse.
I was pleased to receive your letter recently.
I feel very happy with my results, and I can't wait to go to California.
Now I'm going to give you some information you asked about.
I'm sorry to say this, but the only time I will be able to take this trip is in July, according to our team's schedule.
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all the nights in a tent, so I can move it to the place that will suit me best.
I like to wake up with a view of mountains, which reminds me of my 5 years' experience of climbing.
Also I enjoy walking and photography.
I have filled two albums with birds and flowers .
So, is it possible? I would like to continue doing my favourite hobbies in the Camp.
If you need something you have a choice of borrowing it from friends or the library, or buying it.
Let's talk about shopping.
As with everything there are some advantages and disadvantages.
If you were to ask me, I prefer my friends to do all my shopping for me, because I am aware of the big queues at the checkout, crowds of people, noise...
And of course not all shops have good air conditioning.
In my opinion the best time for shopping is weekdays, preferably in the morning.
Otherwise, you will either not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood, because of the bad manners of sales people, who do not give you advice every time you ask for it.
It can be boring, it can be interesting.
To summarise everything, I would recommend spending less time indoors, shopping during the weekdays.
I am writing to you because I received your letter concerning the prize of two weeks in California that I have won.
I would like to travel in the first two weeks of July because in June I will be working and at the end of July I am planning to go to Paris to attend a French course.
I would prefer to be put up in a tent because I love camping but also I don't mind the second possibility.
In your letter you wrote that I will have the chance to do two activities; first of all I would like to play tennis because I have been playing for seven years.
Secondly I would like to attend a surfing course but I have just some elementary knowledge.
I would like also to have more information about the cost and what kind of clothes you suggest I should bring with me.
It will be interesting to show how the lessons are organized, showing that we are never doing just one activity during the class.
We should speak about our library, that it is well furnished with many books, tapes and videos.
After that we have to make sure that we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the times that we have been out together.
In addition I think that some personal opinions about the school should be reported by asking students and teachers.
Finally we should give some information also about our tourism, business and computer courses.
Thank you very much for your letter.
It is great that I could win the first prize in your competition, which means that I will have the opportunity to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am sure it will be an exciting experience for me.
As requested you will find the information you need below.
First, I would like to travel in July because my company is going to close for the holiday at that time and it would suit me very well.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in a tent because I enjoy being outside close to nature.
Thirdly, concerning the activities which I can choose, it is a little bit difficult to decide because I would like to try all of them! As I am very good at tennis and swimming I will choose these.
I have won various little tennis tournaments in my country and abroad, and I am able to swim in every style.
Finally, I have two questions.
Please let me know what clothes I need and how much money in cash and travellers cheques should I take with me.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Sometimes the bad characters in a story are more interesting than the good ones.
I completely agree with this statement.
Recently I have read a short story written by Agatha Christie.
Its title was: "The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge".
The character whom I liked most was that of Mrs.
Havering, the mistress.
It was very exciting because she could play two people at the same time: herself and the housekeeper.
Although from my point of view she planned the murder of his uncle and was able to do it, I think that her husband only followed her orders.
She was the boss in this story.
The plan was almost perfect and the police couldn't have discovered the murderer without the help of Mr.
Poirot.
In my opinion Mrs.
Havering was an extremely intelligent person in addition to being a very good actress and this made this story full of suspense.
Moreover she must have had and strong nerves to handle things in that way.
As far as I am concerned I would appreciate having some of her characteristics myself, .
Secondly, I will be able to travel in July because I am a manager so I cannot travel another time.
Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I cannot sleep on the floor.
I would like to sing and take photographs.
I've done a course in photography and I think that I am very good at it.
On the other hand, I cannot sing very well but I would like to do this activity there.
A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first paycheque and went to a shopping center to spend my money on my credit card.
I bought everything I wanted.
Suddenly the door bell rang.
I went to see who was there.
It was an old woman asking who Maria was.
'That's me!' I said.
I am writing to reply to your letter in which you let me know I have won the first prize in your competition.
I would like to travel in July as it is the only month this year when I do not have any exams.
I am currently attending University and I have exams all term long.
Regarding accommodation I would prefer a tent, as I love nature and I like going camping a lot.
Regarding the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball.
I know very little about surfing, it is almost something new for me.
I have only done it once.
But, on the other hand, I am a good basketball player, and I play three or four times a week as I play in the University team.
There are some things I would like to know first of all: the kind of clothes I should take with me; then, if I need to take any money to the camp; and finally, if you could tell me when I would be leaving and coming back.
But I don't regret going to that concert.
It was wonderful! You know I love designing clothes, and there I had the chance to make a dream come true.
A friend of mine was organising the pop concert, and as he knew me well, he asked me if I'd like to design the clothes the pop singers would wear in the show.
Of course, I accepted immediately, very pleased.
It was a marvellous experience.
I really enjoyed working with such a nice team, they were really kind to me.
And, as if that wasn't enough, I was doing what I love! It's something I will never forget.
I'm writing with reference to your letter.
I was really thrilled, when I found out that I won first prize in your competition.
I always dreamed about going to California and now my dreams are coming true.
If it's possible, I would only like to travel in July, because my school won't be finished earlier.
I couldn't go in August, either, because I promised to go to Masurian Lakes with my friends.
If I had a choice, I would prefer to stay in a tent then in a log cabin.
I can't imagine real holidays without a tent.
It's one of the most important things for me, to have a chance to forget about all my present, luxurious life and try doing something different.
I would like to ask you, what clothes should I take with me? My mother told me, that when she was there two years ago it was really hot.
Should I take with me a lot of money? You know, I'm only a student.
Thanks for your last letter.
I'm sorry I haven't replied sooner, but I was very busy.
I must tell you that helping at pop concerts is very exciting, but very tiring too, so I had to rest.
You asked me about my experiences.
Well, it was the best time of my life! I worked all day, but I did it with pleasure.
but there was a lot of fun, too.
I was very surprised, when I saw that singers aren't so sophisticated and self-confident as they are described in the newspapers.
O.K.
That's all for today.
I'll write to you again tomorrow, because now my Mom is angry, the I am not sleeping yet.
Write soon! I can hardly wait.
Give my best to your parents.
I WOULD PROBABLY ENJOY TRAVELLING IN JULY BECAUSE I HAVE TO TAKE MY LITERATURE EXAMS BEFORE THEN AND I'M TAKING THEM IN JUNE.
TO ANSWER ANOTHER OF YOUR QUESTIONS, I'D PREFER TO HAVE A LOG CABIN, BECAUSE OF MY BACK PROBLEM, WHICH WON'T LET ME SLEEP ON THE GROUND (OR IN A SLEEPING BAG).
I'M REALLY KEEN ON KEEPING TO MY TENNIS AND SWIMMING ROUTINES DURING MY STAY AT THE CAMP.
I USUALLY SWIM THREE TIMES A WEEK IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A BACK TREATMENT WHICH MY DOCTOR HAS RECOMMENDED ME TO FOLLOW.
ALSO, IF I HAVE ANY LEISURE TIME BETWEEN SCHOOL AND PIANO LESSONS, I PLAY TENNIS.
SO, IF POSSIBLE, I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING MY ROUTINE THERE.
LASTLY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TELL ME IF I HAVE TO BRING SOME MONEY WITH ME TO BUY FOOD OR DRINKS AND HOW THE CLIMATE OF THE CAMPING AREA IS SO I CAN PACK MY LUGGAGE, BRINGING ONLY THE APPROPRIATE CLOTHES.
ARE YOU A SCIENCE FICTION STORIES LOVER? DO YOU LOVE THE IDEA OF KNOWING ? IF YOU REALLY FIND READING THIS KIND OF BOOK INTERESTING, YOU SHOULDN'T MISS THIS BOOK.
DURING THE LAST MONTH I'VE BEEN READING "A WINDOW ON THE UNIVERSE", AN OXFORD BOOKMARKS COLLECTION BOOK.
THIS BOOK CONTAINED NINE STORIES WHICH WERE WRITTEN BY WELL-KNOWN WRITERS LIKE RAY BRADBURY.
BUT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE BOOK IS TO ALLOW YOU TO FLY WITH YOUR IMAGINATION AND TO HAVE A GLIMPSE OF HOW LIFE IS GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE, WHEN, PERHAPS THE WORLD WILL BE RULED BY MACHINES.
I THINK THAT THIS IS A MARVELLOUS BOOK TO READ, BECAUSE YOU ARE ABLE TO THEMES LIKE "THE EXTINCTION OF THE HUMAN RACE" AND ALSO TO MAKE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE HUMAN MIND AND COMPUTERS.
First I would like to answer your questions.
I am only available in July.
Is that okay for you? This is because the only time I can take a holiday is July.
I would prefer log cabins.
I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents.
Regarding the two activities, I choose swimming and painting.
I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much.
I took swimming lessons for four years.
And the reason I choose painting is it's very exciting for me.
I am not very good at this but I will improve my painting.
It's been a long time since I wrote to you.
I'm really sorry but I was very busy.
I worked until midnight every day.
Actually I don't work, you know.
I have been decorating a concert hall for a pop concert.
It was very important for us because we really wanted people to enjoy it.
It was very enjoyable.
I made lots of friends.
We were together all day, painting the walls, cleaning and putting up some balloons and other stuff everywhere.
And at the time of the concert we wore big funny costumes, and danced with people.
Everybody liked it very much.
Anyway we worked .
What I liked most was meeting the band.
Guess what the name of the band is; Back Street Boys.
Oh, my God, they're such nice, talkative, funny, people.
But you know they're a bit spoilt.
I am really pleased to hear from you that I won first prize in the competition.
It is the thing I really want.
Now I am going to answer the questions you asked me in the letter.
First, I am afraid I can only travel in July.
I've got a three-month holiday from June to August but I've already promised my aunt, who runs a small nursing home in Andover, to help her during June and in August.
I have to work to get my next-term tuition fee.
So July is the only month I can take part in your activities.
Second, regarding accommodation, I'd like to stay in a log cabin.
I am very sensitive to noise especially at night and tend to catch a cold even in summer.
And I would love to learn surfing and painting.
I am quite good at swimming but I never tried surfing.
So this time I am really keen on learning that.
I also love painting.
I expect you have lovely countryside in California for me to draw on my canvas.
I am really looking forward to going there and to your reply.
For example, all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends.
Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins.
What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall.
And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare.
So I prefer shopping on weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.
However, people can't have a good time even on weekdays while shopping.
Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get.
In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.
For the handicapped, going shopping is not easy and it can be very annoying unless shops have facilities for them.
Despite all these things which show that shopping is not always enjoyable, people have to go shopping.
Otherwise they can have lots of problems and it is difficult to live.
First of all, I can only travel in July because I have exams at school and they are very important to me and I hope you will understand my problem.
And I would like to stay in a log cabin, because I do not like sleeping in tents, because of the bugs and insects.
For the activities I would like to choose the tennis , which I am not too bad at, and climbing, which I have never done but which must be interesting.
I would like to know if I need to take any clothes, and, if so, what kind of clothes? I also want to know if I should take any money, or if all the expenses are paid by you.
I am looking forward to your reply.
Sometimes people go to the mall to look at products and don't even buy anything.
But of course, there are some exceptions.
For example, when you buy something, you might lose it and never see it again, or you could be robbed, or if the product has something wrong with it, then you have to swap it and that takes time.
And sometimes the cashpoint machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or you have exceeded the limit on your credit card.
Another bad thing is that people want some things very badly, and they can't afford them.
That makes those people frustrated and they don't enjoy themselves.
To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only in July, as it is the only time when I can take my holidays.
I'd prefer to sleep in tents rather than log cabins: sleeping in tents seems to correspond to a "spirit of adventure" to me, which I particularly like; in contrast, log cabins are more "traditional" and a less interesting experience.
When I was a child, I was very good at basketball, one of the best in my class even.
I like playing in a team and deciding quickly what to do next.
These are why I'd also like to go sailing.
Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospheric conditions.
Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need.
I thank you very much in advance for your kind assistance.
The first idea about shopping is that buying something will be a pleasure for the buyer and, for that reason, will be enjoyable.
But this is not always the case: at first, you see a very pretty item which you'd like to try on.
When you ask to, the sales person often answers that your size is out of stock.
, you try to find the same thing in another shop.
You ask the sales person for your size.
His answer is: "Everything is here, Madam!" As you understand that you won't get any help, you waste your time looking for the right size.
Finally, you find the right one but you don't have enough money.
The moment you realise that, you also realise that the shop is closing in five minutes.
Firstly, I was asked when my trip would be and I have come to the conclusion that the only time I will be able to go is in July because during that month I have my winter break both from work and school and that is when I will be free to go.
Another point mentioned was the choice of activities.
I would like to try sailing as I have never sailed before and also climbing as I enjoy hiking a lot.
I actually have a lot of stamina and balance so that will help me in both activities.
I look forward to receiving your reply and hope the information above will help towards the preparation for the weeks in question.
Men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite pastime.
However, that impression is not always true.
Everyone enjoys wearing nice new clothes.
However, do we really like the process of choosing them? At times, it is not only a matter of having to make a choice but the trouble of finding something which can waste a lot of time and especially when your taste doesn't fit in with the fashion.
The colour along with the style and size, blue or red, long or short, medium or large.
What is more, we can say that price is often very off-putting as well.
Most people usually go shopping for something which is affordable, and many times they find, for example, a dress they like a lot but they cannot buy it because it is terribly expensive.
Then, I consider it a pain having to go around some more still thinking of that same dress.
Finally, of going in and out of fitting rooms and figuring out discounts.
etc.
I would like to travel in July, because it is the only time I will have free.
I was very happy to hear that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for.
And I would prefer a tent to a log cabin, because I have had experience of staying in a tent and I like it very much.
Thank you for the chance to do two activities.
I would like to choose Tennis and Photography.
I have played tennis since I was ten years of age.
In my opinion tennis is the best sport I have ever played.
Another activity which I have chosen is photography.
I have just finished a professional photography course and I would like to continue my education in this activity.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Like I said, I helped at a pop concert.
I liked it very much.
It was very interesting and enjoyable.
The pop concert had ten pop bands.
Each of them had to sing two songs.
After that they chose the three best bands.
At this concert I saw a lot of popular singers.
For example: Maraya Kary, Tom Jone; Madonna.
I saw the "Boys on".
I knew you love them and I got two autographs for you and of course for myself.
I was shocked because I had already spoken with them and I had got two autographs.
.
I am really pleased to hear from you that I won the prize.
So I can go camping for two weeks.
It must be great.
And I would like to have chances to play tennis and go swimming.
In the case of swimming, I am really good at it but I just started playing tennis 3 weeks ago.
However, I am really enjoying playing tennis.
With regard to your questions.
First of all, I would be very happy if you could arrange my trip and stay at the camp for July.
I will still be at school in June, and I am going to spend the whole of August on a training camp with my club.
July is really the only available time I have.
If possible, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin.
I spent 3 weeks in a tent last year and it wasn't the best experience of my life.
I would like to avoid tents if possible.
You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis.
I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train in it in August as well - I don't want to lose touch with it.
Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still at beginner level.
It seems like a good opportunity to practise it.
I look forward to hearing from you and I can't wait to go to the USA.
In my humble opinion, shopping is one of the most stressful and boring activities people do in life.
If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on an everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere at the top of the list.
If it were possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me.
No.
Most definitely, shopping is not an enjoyable activity and I can easily think of many nicer ones.
I'm writing to answer your questions but, first of all, to thank you for the prize.
I would like to travel in July because it is the school holiday here in Portugal and I will have the entire month to travel, so I have no preference for which weeks.
I don't mind staying in log cabins, but I prefer camping because I want to be really close to nature.
Well, about the activities, I love Photography.
I did a course and I would like to take beautiful photos of the Camp.
And I always was good at swimming.
Now I'll be at the Camp during the summer I think it is a good idea.
I'm looking forward to receiving your letter.
Nowadays shopping is one of the activities that makes our society live.
The cities are the main commercial centres, our streets are full of billboards advertising many things , as does TV either.
Despite this shopping culture, shopping is not always enjoyable.
When you need to buy something you have to look for the best price, which is always a , and if you find a shop where the price is cheaper, it be crowded.
The solution could be .
You can buy anything without any problem.
This is a good thing although it prevents poor people from shopping , because you have to have a computer.
Anyway, other alternatives to shopping are being created and we can choose not to waste our time shopping.
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00.
I was really amazed by the news that I'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
With regard to the date that I would like to travel it must be July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I'm going to have some free time from this date until early August when I will start to work.
I would like to spend my time at your Camp site in a log cabin.
I think that is going to be more comfortable for me due to the fact that I am very sensitive to changes of temperature and I can't take the risk of catching a cold because ,as you know, I'm going to start to work.
The activities that I would like to do there are the following:- Singing (I'm a very good singer); swimming , I'm not good at all at this one, but I enjoy spending time in the water, I really do.
Would you be so kind as to let me know what kind of weather you have in July in order that I can choose the right clothing to bring.
And also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not included.
How are you? I'm fine and I am writing to you because I know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; I have to tell you that I did help there and it was very hard work.
You can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
I really enjoyed the opportunity to talk with well-known stars and to learn how to set up everything for a concert.
If you have the opportunity to do this don't miss out.
I hope to see you soon to give you more details.
Bye.
Thank you for sending me this wonderful news.
I was really happy when I learned I won the first prize.
I am writing to give you my details and ask for some more information.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I need to stay at home in August.
I am a college student and I am going to study at university this year.
I will take my exams in June and have the results in August.
So I shall stay to prepare for my university.
Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins so that I can have more chances to be with other people, then I can make more friends.
During the camp, I will do singing and climbing activities.
I enjoy singing all the time and I want to share my music with others.
I also like climbing because I like the view on the top of hills.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
The English class is going to make a short video about the school's daily life.
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about which lessons and activities should be filmed.
The Speaking and Listening class should be filmed because the purpose of this class is to encourage students to talk about some topics they choose and discuss them with others in order to improve their speaking and listening skills.
The topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up to date.
The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals, sports, museums, etc.
It is popular with the students.
The canteen is the place students get together apart from class.
Quite a lot of students spend their free time there relaxing and talking.
Basketball is the most popular activity, which takes place between 4:30 pm - 6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week.
Not only but also a lot of students watch.
The lessons and activities above are what we suggest should be filmed.
I have received your letter and I am so glad I have won the first prize.
I have answers to your questions.
I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time for me to go on holiday because the 12th of July is my birthday.
I want to sleep in tents because I think it's more adventurous with better scenery, and atmosphere.
You also asked me about the two things I'm good at.
Well, the first one is basketball.
I have been playing basketball for roughly 4 years.
I love basketball because I'm good at it and it is my favourite sport.
The other thing I'm good at is tennis.
I have been playing tennis for 2 years and I won the Under 16's U.S open tournament last summer.
Last of all I have questions to ask you.
Will I have to bring many clothes i.e.
will we do a lot of outdoor activities, get dirty etc? Will I need a lot of money? Looking forward to seeing you soon.
This composition is about shopping.
People today shop seven days a week with their family, friends etc.
But I think shopping is not always enjoyable.
This statement is the great amount of rubbish we are producing in the world.
The more stuff we buy, the more we throw away.
Shopping with some friends may be fun but you must also remember that you are spending money.
Therefore you should think more carefully about what you are about to buy.
You can enjoy yourself in other different ways.
For example, you can do sports, which are enjoyable and good for your health.
Would you rather spend money on something which is destroying the world or do sports, which are good for you.
You must think about your children, who will be living in the world you helped to destroy.
The ozone layer is being punctured when plastics or foams are burnt.
I think this is all I have to say to make you think that shopping isn't always enjoyable and change your views regarding shopping.
I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to receive your letter in which you said that I have won the first prize in your competition, of two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.
I am writing to inform you that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place at university and it will start in August.
Is the time I request available? I would also like to ask accommodation you offer is in tents or log cabins.
If I can choose I would prefer tents.
I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning.
In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities.
I can't wait to do my painting of the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers will be.
Finally, can you tell me what kind of clothes I should bring with me, and how much spending money will be needed.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
I don't really like shopping.
Sometimes when I'm bored and can't find something else to do, I go look round the shops.
When I see some clothes in the window I like, I go in and try them on.
But I always find they do not look nice on me.
at the weekend.
All the shops are full of people, and people treat the items like rubbish, hanging them everywhere after they have tried them on and found that they did not suit them.
Also with weekend shopping, you can't find somewhere to sit down comfortably to have a cup of tea.
Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, are all full of people.
However, shopping is a nice way to spend your leisure time and give yourself a chance to relax sometimes, but I suggest that you never do it at the weekend.
I have won the first prize! I am extremely happy about this.
I am writing because of some information that you need.
I can only take a holiday in July because I am going to start a new at the beginning of August.
Of course I would like to stay in a tent.
When I was a child we often camped.
Staying in a tent will remind me of an unforgettable time.
There are a lot of interesting activities and that makes it hard to choose only two.
Given the circumstances, I would like to learn more about photography and painting.
I have some skills in landscape drawing but I have no idea about photography.
Taking pictures is a new experience for me.
How are you doing? I couldn't write to you because I was very busy.
Given the circumstances, they asked me to help in the kitchen.
You can imagine how disappointed I was.
But it turned out to be a fun and interesting job.
I had to prepare the ingredients for every meal.
That meant I had to read the recipes very carefully.
And I had to check that nothing was missed.
The best thing was that I got a lot of new cooking ideas and I could observe new cooking tricks.
I had a lot to do and I was never bored.
The people were all really funny and we were a good team.
The time went quickly and it was a great experience.
Thank you, it was great to hear about my prize.
You ask me for some information - here it is.
First I can travel only in July, because I can't get any free time in any other month.
The next thing is that I would prefer a log cabin.
I don't want to sleep in a tent, because I'm afraid of snakes and similar animals.
About the activities at the camp, I can tell you that I like to play tennis and I play it very well.
Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play golf.
It's a very popular sport in our region (area) also, but I have never found time to do it.
I'm a beginner at golf you have to know.
I think this will be all I want to know.
If there are any other questions on your part, please call me or write again.
Sorry, I'm late I know, but now I will tell you something about my experience last month.
The concert started on the 15th of May and it was a really great session in our valley.
I was so happy when they asked me to help them with the organisation.
I was responsible for the advertisements and I also had to invite the "important people" from our government.
It was really a new job for me, but I think I did well.
I've learned a lot about management and especially how stars live.
One evening we all went out for dinner and after we went to a new disco.
We arrived at home early in the morning - it was great.
Now Kim, I will finish my letter but I promise to write again as soon as possible.
Maybe if I've developed the photos of the concert and the stars and the ....
A good idea - you come here and I will tell you some other stories.
I am very happy to know I won the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I think I would like to travel only in July because at that time I am going to be free to travel because of my school holidays.
I would rather stay in a tent, because I have stayed in tents before and I liked it.
It is more pleasant than staying in log cabins and it is such a wonderful experience.
Referring to sports, I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions.
About basketball, I would say I like to play it as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool.
I was not as good at it as I was at swimming but I like it.
I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable because a lot of things can happen to you.
I remember when I was younger I used to go with my mom to the stores shopping but I did not like it, because I found it boring to buy clothes, spending a lot of hours in a shopping centre.
Another bad thing was the enormous queues in the supermarkets.
It is incredible how much time you can spend in there.
Last month there was a robbery in a shopping centre next to my house.
Somebody stole a lady's purse with all her identification, credit cards and cash, even her plane ticket.
Therefore she had to do a lot of to cancel her credit cards and to change her plane ticket.
Unlucky lady.
To sum up I would say that even if shopping is not enjoyable we have to do it because we do not have another option.
Thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition.
I also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go to.
About the trip, I think it would be preferable to do it in July, which is a holiday period and so I won't have any obligations.
While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can be closer to nature.
Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time.
Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do, especially during a holiday! Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball.
Any little of this kind would be great.
Before ending my letter I would like to know in particular what kind of clothes I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine into dollars.
As you know last month I went to help at a concert, the one that I told you about in my last letter.
I wanted to go there very much and so going there to help was for me a unique opportunity.
Moreover instead of buying a ticket I went there for free, as a helper.
From the first moment that I got there I understood that I was going to have a great night.
OK, in the beginning the other helpers and I had a lot of work to do, such as cleaning the stage and some decoration work.
But when the concert started and we finished what we had to do, we were free to do whatever we wanted.
So the party started...
The pop concert was excellent and I had a lot of fun.
Don't ask the time when I came home because I don't remember! Some of my friends who were also helping told me that we returned at six o'clock in the morning! It was really an unforgettable experience.
I have just received your letter and I thank you for your invitation and congratulations.
I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction with your perfect organisation.
About the information requested from me, I have to say that I can travel only in July because of my job; I am busy until the end of June.
As regards accommodation, I prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quiet place because I am fond of nature and I would like to feel free in an informal setting.
My favourite sports activities are playing tennis and basketball.
I like competitive and challenging sports.
I enjoy comparing my skill with other players and, if possible, I would rather not do indoor sports activities, but open air ones.
I would like to know if special clothes are needed and what the weather is like that time of year.
The one last thing that I would like to know is if I have to bring with me money for expenses not included in your invitation.
Let me know this information as soon as possible.
I have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject.
Also the sports activities should be filmed; they express an and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events.
The dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements.
I hope that these suggestions can be accepted and appreciated.
I am writing to you in order to answer your questions and to get some information I would like to have.
First of all, I want you to know I am really happy about the prize.
The only problem is that as I am a student I can travel only during the holidays, in July.
Regarding accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I have never been camping and I would like to try it.
I am not really keen on art.
That is why I would prefer doing some sports like surfing and sailing.
If I had to be honest, I would say I have never done either of them.
Yet, I would like to try them because my city is far from the sea so I don't have many opportunities of doing them.
I would appreciate it if you could tell me what kind of clothes and how much money I should take.
, I wonder if I will share a tent or not and if I have to bring it or if it will be provided by you.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter.
If I didn't tell you about my experience at the pop concert in detail in my last letter it was because I didn't have time.
Please don't be angry.
I will tell you everything right now.
A few months ago I chatted, via the Internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires who happened to be one of the members of "Los Pericos".
We started mailing each other and became good friends.
They had to give a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me to where they were preparing the concert.
The problem was that one of the technicians was from England and nobody there spoke a word of English so I was asked to be the interpreter.
It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I have just received your letter and I'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so hard.
Being at Camp California was one of the dreams of my life and now I can realise it.
Firstly, I could spend these two weeks during next July only, because, before and after it, I have to work as a waiter here in my town.
However, about accommodation, I'd prefer a log cabin, because it is more comfortable than a tent.
All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing, because I'm used to playing tennis every weekend and I'm very keen on surfing.
I'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too.
Lastly, I'm interested in the law schools in California.
They are very famous here.
This is a letter that I write to you now.
I'm very happy and lazy at the same time.
Last month I visited Tom, another old friend, and he told me I could work with him as a musician at the XZY pop concert.
"This is extraordinary", I said.
Firstly, I was very embarrassed during the concert, but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too.
This was the most important experience in my life, I knew all the people, in particular the famous singer "Kos".
He is funny and easy going.
During the concert, I was near the and opposite there was "Pipe" the biggest in the world.
It's very difficult describing all the emotions I felt.
I can only tell you that it had been an important experience for me and for my new songs.
Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I won't be able to write even this letter .
I have just received your letter and I am so pleased with the news.
I'd like to tell you that the best month for me to travel to the U.S.A.
is July because I will be on holiday in that month.
I don't really worry about the accommodation at Camp California, but if I can I'll choose to stay in a tent.
This is because it will be more exciting and fun than in log cabins.
From the list of activities at the Camp I will enjoy singing and swimming.
I used to go to a swimming pool twice every week and also I love music and sing all the time.
I'd like to ask you about how much money I'll need for two weeks in your country and what sort of clothes I have to bring to Camp California next July.
I am looking forward to hearing from you very soon.
Well, Kim, I hope to see you soon and take care.
I received your letter recently, and I am really happy to learn that I have won the first prize.
So, I am writing to you to answer your questions.
First of all, I have to tell you that my only chance to go there is in July; the dates do not matter, but it is important for me to be back before the 1st of August, because that day I will start a summer job.
About the accommodation during those two weeks, I would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little  room.
Your next question is about the activities that I could do at the camp.
After browsing through the list, I would like to take part in climbing and photographic activities, as these are my favourite hobbies.
I had an induction climbing course two years ago, and I still climb regularly.
I can do a V+ level climb.
On the other hand I took a photography course five years ago, and I took part in several competitions.
Looking forward to your answer.
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular.
The shopping centres are always busy, with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows; it seems everybody is happy.
In the hurry you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use your plastic money.
The shop assistant passes the credit card through the machine, after a few seconds he does it again, and does it another time .
Suddenly his face changes and he tells you that the card is faulty! No choice: you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad.
I can only travel in July because this is the month when I have holidays.
I've already talked to my manager, and she said that that's the only month I can have my holidays.
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it must be cold staying in a tent.
I have some problems with my kidneys, so I can't stay in one of the tents, and also it must be very comfortable staying in a log cabin.
I'm really good at Golf and Tennis, so I would like to choose these two activities.
I've been doing these activities for a very long time.
I've been playing Golf for five years, and I've a handicap of sixteen, but the problem is that I haven't been playing Golf for a long time because I work every day.
I've been playing tennis since I was seven, and I've been studying how to play tennis for a very long time, nine years.
I wish you had been there with me helping at a pop concert.
I just loved it.
I was working with this music system.
You know how good I am at musicAnyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds.
At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc...
The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us.
I asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your tv on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar.
AH, it was lovely.
These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see this pop concert.
Believe me, you'll love it and you might play the drums.
I told them that you're really good on drums so they want to try you too.
I'll write to you soon Kim.
I would like to thank you for the first prize in your competition: two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
I am pleased to accept this prize.
As you said, you need some further information.
First of all, I would like to travel in July.
At present, I am doing an art course at college.
So I won't be able to have a holiday until then.
I would rather stay in log cabins than tents.
I have some trouble with my back.
Therefore I can't sleep in a sleeping bag on the ground.
Furthermore, I would love to do basketball and painting activities while I am at the camp.
I am a member of the college basketball team, which became the best basketball team of last year.
Secondly, I want to do painting, which I am really interested in as a student at art college.
Lastly, I would like to learn what kinds of clothes I have to bring with me and how much money (American currency - dollars) I'll need to have while I'm there.
I would like to thank you for your letter, which I received yesterday, and I wanted to reply as soon as possible.
I know you want to hear about what I did and how I helped people at the pop concert last month.
As you know, our college was chosen to be there and help the singers and the musicians out.
When I first arrived there I was pretty nervous and excited.
My friends and I were taken backstage where we met the members of West Life, Elton John and Robie Williams.
I even got a bunch of flowers from them with a "thank you" letter.
What we all did was make many cups of coffee and help to find their missing socks or any other clothing.
What I realised was they were not different from any of us but they were called celebrities.
I particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc, which was really great, and also to be able to meet these famous singers made me realise we can achieve whatever we want.
I've been thrilled ever since I received your letter indicating my luck of having won the first prize in the competition that you organized recently.
In response to the letter, I am sending mine to state the choices that I have made concerning the date of the trip, the place where I will be staying and the two activities that I have chosen, along with some questions.
Firstly, I wish to travel in July as I already have plans for June, which are to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacation commences.
Secondly, regarding the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much.
Among the numerous choices of activities, I am considering taking those of golf and surfing.
I have been playing golf since the age of 8, therefore I am certain that I will not require help of any sort.
However, as this will be my first time surfing, I am willing to take classes for beginners.
Lastly, I've been struggling with the question of money and clothing and would like to be informed about the climate there so that I will be able to pack the clothes that I need and I would be thankful if you would consider sending me an estimation of the amount of money I will have to spend in the camp.
I am looking forward to being received at camp California.
I was glad to receive a letter from you and after having heard that you are interested in helping pop singers have a concert, I started writing as soon as I could.
I think it's a wonderful idea and my advice is to take it if you have an offer! I had so much fun helping my friends' band putting on their concert.
The concert was a hit and the stage looked fabulous! The audience seemed pretty impressed as well.
I thought it was a great opportunity to see how things turn out so well when you put everybody's different talents together.
I'm not sure what part you're interested in, but I think drawing the background for the stage was the best, and I suggest that you try doing it too.
I'm very happy to have won your competition.
I've never been to the U.S.A so I'm very excited to visit Camp California.
I can come only in July because I have to work the other months of summer.
Regarding accommodation I'd prefer to sleep in a tent because I like being outside and hearing the noises of the sea.
My two preferred activities are climbing and surfing.
I used to climb and I want to try it again because climbing is a good way to keep fit.
I want to do surfing too because I like snowboarding and I think surfing , but I have never tried it.
I have one question to ask you.
I have a little brother and I want to know if I could take him with me.
He doesn't like to stay at home alone.
a maths lesson, an English lesson, a swimming lesson, the break and the staff room.
- In the maths lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher teaches his students.
We could film the classroom too.
- In the swimming pool we could be in the water and , because he enters competitions.
- We could show the activities of the students during the break.
For example, students who play football or volleyball.
We could ask some students about the school.
- Before the end we could visit the staff room.
We could find out what this room is like and what the teachers do in this mysterious room.
At the end we could have a comment from each student in our class.
Thank you for your letter.
I have just received the letter from you.
I am really pleased that I have won first prize in your competition Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July this year because I think the weather will be nice and I can take a holiday.
I would like to use a tent for my accommodation.
I think it is more interesting than a log cabin.
I can be closer to nature and I have never used tents before.
It seems to be exciting.
I choose swimming and painting for my activities while I am at the Camp.
I really like swimming.
When I was a child, I used to go swimming with my family at the weekend, having a chat, making a barbecue, playing games.
It was such a good time.
I enjoy painting as well.
My mother told me that I'm good at painting.
When I was in high school, I won second prize in a painting competition.
My parents were very proud of me.
I've got some great news to tell you.
Last month, I got a part-time job.
I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert.
As you know, I'm crazy about pop music.
Before the concert I was really excited.
I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do at the concert.
It was such a big concert.
There were lots of singers and a band.
Of course, there were lots of .
First, I was in front of the entrance door.
I had to check tickets.
I was really excited.
My hands were trembling but I did it very well.
After that, I went back stage.
I could see lots of pop stars.
I'm sorry that I didn't ask if I could take any pictures of them for you.
I was really busy.
I had to take care of them and did everything they wanted.
For instance, taking them to the toilet, making coffee for them, helping them find their stuff.
It was really busy but I really enjoyed it.
I learnt lots of thing there that I couldn't learn from school.
I had to be more patient.
I met lots of people with different jobs.
I had a great time.
First of all, I would like to thank you for doing such a good job organising the competition which I luckily won.
I have been really very impressed.
Unfortunately I received your letter two weeks late so I can travel only between the 5th and the 20th July.
In fact I will finish my university exams only on the first of July and after the 20th it is impossible because I am going to do four weeks' voluntary work in India for UNICEF.
If it is possible I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because, in spite of my love for nature, I am terribly allergic to pollen.
So a stay in a log cabin will probably save me a lot of problems.
Choosing two activities from the list has been very difficult but I think I would like to do climbing, a sport in which I have many years of experience, and surfing, despite not really having any experience.
Unfortunately I have never been to the US so I don't have any idea about how much money I will probably need or about what kind of clothes I have to take with me.
If you ask twenty women what their favourite hobbies are probably most of them will answer "shopping".
The verb "have" is probably the most used and loved by the human species.
We are always trying to have more things, which lead us to neglect our family, our future, and other things which are probably more important than a new perfume.
More and more people, everywhere, are becoming shopping addicts.
Maybe you think I am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous.
Probably when Oscar Wilde said: "Superficiality is the supreme vice" he was right.
We still look at what people look like and not at what they really are.
I hope to have a chance to practise both of them at 'Camp California'.
 We buy everything from clothes to food and the only thing that could stop us from this is money.
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping.
It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like you are flying.
Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about where I get money for my wishes.
It all comes from my parents.
All I have to do is buy and choose.
I think that ,,having is a dream'' for all of us.
However I can't agree with the opinion that ,,Shopping is not always enjoyable'' I think that everybody likes to buy but not everybody likes to take pleasure in it.
I would like to thank you for the prize I won.
My name is Manuel P.
Martinez and I won the first prize in your competition.
I have been informed that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for by the company.
I can only travel in July because I am working as a receptionist in a hotel and they would only let me have two weeks off in that month.
I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent, because I find it more comfortable to sleep in a bed, but it wouldn't be a problem if I have to sleep in a tent.
I would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports I have never tried before.
That means I do not have any experience .
Thank you for your letter.
I am so happy to win the prize and realise my dream.
I would like to travel to California this July, because I can take a holiday from 14th to 27th of July.
I would prefer log cabins.
I have never used one and I think it would be more exciting than tents.
I have heard that Camp California is famous for surfing, so I hope that I will enjoy surfing for the first time.
Besides, I will take the opportunity to play golf.
It is my only favourite hobby.
What about clothes and money? I don't know what the weather is like, and you are paid for travel costs, but I am wondering whether it includes two activities.
Also, I have a dog.
Can I go with him.
Please, let me know the answers to these questions as soon as possible.
To reply to your question, it was really a nice experience.
As you know, I like pop music so much and the singer was one of my favourite singers.
Also, in the future I want to be an organizer like at this concert, so it'll be useful experience for me.
I am writing about how I got the position and what I did.
Firstly, I applied to a concert agency to help, because I had the experience before and I knew how to organize and what to do.
At the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments.
It was somewhat hard for me.
After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again.
I have just received your letter and feel happy about winning first prize.
I am now writing to give you all the information you require.
First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June.
In August I am going to apply for a new job.
Another consideration are the activities.
I enjoy playing basketball and golf.
Also I think I am good at singing and at dancing.
The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's attitudes to the video they have to make and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
The report is based on the opinions of more than 300 pupils.
- lessons in Mathematics and History, because pupils have very good exam results.
- the basketball competition, because our school's team won first prize in our .
- Also they would like to film the pet corner at school, because they enjoy taking care of animals.
Conclusion: It is clear that the making of the video is a very important event for the children, and pupils would prefer to film only the positive events of their life at school, which I have written above.
I would now like to provide the information you requested.
Firstly, I would be pleased if I could travel in July as I already booked this month as a holiday at work.
 I would prefer to stay in a tent since I have never had the exciting experience of sleeping close to nature.
I am especially glad about the activities offered, in particular the sports facilities because I specialised in sport for my A-levels and intend to become a sports teacher.
I have been playing basketball for many years but I would appreciate improving my skills, in particular my ball handling.
Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly wait to have the opportunity to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect at the crawl.
I am really surprised I won, and I would like to say thank you for everything.
This is why I wrote and sent this letter with the information you needI can only travel in July because it is the only time when I can do it before workI do not really care what accommodation I will have.
I would prefer to come in July .
I would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at Camp California I choose the Golf and Photography because I think I am really interested in those subjects.
I am not really really good but I have some experience.
I would like to ask you what kind of clothes I need to take for the place and for the weather , how much money do I need to take? I think that is everything I would like to know.
Thank you very much for your time.
How are you? I hope you are fine .
I really enjoy that kind of day, what about you? I need to go out now.
I will keep in touch.
love and kisses.
I am writing to you in reply to your letter about my winning the first prize in your competition.
First of all, I would like to thank the jury for choosing my work from all the competitors.
Next, I would like to find out some details about the camp.
I need to know if my travel will take place in August.
If I had known that I would win, I would not have arranged my English course in Britain.
The next point is the accommodation.
You mentioned that it will be in tents or log cabins.
I would prefer staying in tents.
I am very close to nature, so it will be a pleasure for me.
What's more, your letter said about the chance to do two activities during the camp.
I am very interested in tennis, but I am also very good at photography.
It has been my hobby since I was a child.
I have even won a competition once.
That is why I would like to continue doing this at the camp.
Finally, I would like to ask about other things like: clothes, money, guide.
I would like to know if the ,,travel costs'' which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places, because I would like to do some sightseeing in the U.S.A.
Furthermore, if there will be tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp.
When describing the advantages, we should remember that most people like doing shopping.
It is very pleasant when you are looking for something special or for special occasions like wedding, birthday, or Christmas presents.
Next, it can be very good for your wallet to save some money, when you find a bargain or sales.
As well as that, some shop assistants can give you a lower price, because you always do shopping at their shop.
What is more, most people cannot live without shopping.
It is their way to spend free time.
On the other hand, there are some minuses.
Above all, shopping is very tiring and exhausting.
Walking from shop to shop carrying heavy bags, takes much of your time.
Instead of that you could do more interesting things, such as playing sports or reading a book.
Besides that, shopping .
Very often people go to a shop - usually a big department store and buy things which they do not need.
In my opinion shopping is very tiring and I usually try to avoid doing it.
When I have to, I do it, but I think we waste too much time on it .
On balance some people still like shopping even if it is not always enjoyable and they have to stand in a long queue to buy something.
From my point of view it depends on us whether shopping will be enjoyable or not.
Referring to the competition I won, I would like to say that I am very happy to be the winner.
Accordingly I will give you the further information that you wanted.
First, you asked about when I would like to travel and the only possible time for me is in July, because my company only gave me holiday time in this period.
Second, I prefer to stay in a tent.
I want to feel the real nature and spirit of Camp California.
Furthermore, I should choose between two activities and say how good I am at each one.
I choose singing and surfing - singing because I am a singer in a band and I hope to make my voice more perfect and surfing because I have never surfed and I want to learn how.
Thanks for your letter.
I am so glad that I have won first prize in your competition.
And thanks again for offering me two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
As you asked, I think I'd like to travel only in July, because I am quite busy with my job.
July is the only free time that I have.
And I prefer tents to log cabins, as I know tents better than log cabins.
I used to sleep in a tent once on my holiday, and a tent is more suitable for camping.
It is very kind of you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp.
I'd like to do climbing and sailing.
Actually I am quite good at climbing.
I often go climbing in my town.
As for sailing, well, I haven't tried it before.
That is why I want to have a go.
I think it must be fun.
I think most people will agree that "shopping is not always enjoyable", because so far as I know nothing is enjoyable all the time.
Some people might say women just love shopping, they couldn't stop thinking about going shopping.
Yes, it is true.
This is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money.
They have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
Women just love spending money in shops.
Just imagine if one day their husbands lost their jobs.
Will those women still think shopping is enjoyable! So it depends on the case.
As for me, I don't think shopping is enjoyable at all.
I even hate shopping.
I never go shopping unless I really need something.
Shopping is just like a nightmare to me.
I think I will never understand why people love shopping.
How can you look at the same goods at the same shop all the time.
I think most men have the same opinion as I do.
Some women spend their whole life shopping, and most of the time, they don't buy many things.
In my eyes they are wasting their lives, they are hopeless.
Those are only my opinions.
You don't need to agree with them, but one day you might find out that what I have said is not totally wrong.
I have just received your letter and I want to thank you for all this information that you are giving me.
First of all, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year, and the weather will be really nice.
Secondly, I think it would be better to stay in tents, so that we can have a nice time at Camp California and find many interesting games to play .
However, as you asked me to choose two activities, I'm choosing swimming and climbing, because I'm very good at swimming and I would like to try climbing.
Despite my lack of experience in climbing I do want to try this type of sport.
In addition, I would like to know how much money I have to bring with me.
I think that is all that I would like to know.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed.
I have interviewed each student from my English class.
Firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.
Also you can come from different countries.
I would like to travel only in July because my boss cannot give me any leave for the other months in summer.
Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose.
To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing.
I'm good at both of these.
I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like music a lot and everybody tells me that I have a good voice.
I would like to ask you about the weather.
I want to know if I should bring warm clothes or not and how much money.
how are you? Thanks for your letter.
It was good to hear from you now.
As you know this summer I am really enjoying myself doing things I like a lot.
Last month, Alice and her friends suggested to me that I help at a pop concert.
The group which was singing was very famous and I was able to meet them and to chat about their plans for the future.
All I had to do was to prepare something to eat before the concert and to check the sound during it.
The concert lasted for hours and at the end they wanted to pay me.
I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the Savage Garden concert live and because that night was the best of my life.
But the thing I particularly liked about my experience was the feeling when you are near and when you talk with .
P.S.
I hope you will find the spare time to visit my country this summer.
As regards when I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only travel in July because I am really tied up at this time owing to the exam period, which will last until the end of June.
I'd rather have accommodation in tents, it would be a good experience for me, especially because I haven't .
As you have informed me, there are a lot of activities that we can do.
Swimming is my favourite sport.
I was born and raised on a Greek island called Crete.
The sea is part of me.
Furthermore I will have the opportunity to play basketball, despite the fact that I am not very tall for this kind of sport.
However, I used to play basketball in my school because we didn't have any other type of court other than the basketball court.
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about the short video which my college is going to make about the daily life of our school.
It considers two areas: the lessons and the activities which should be filmed.
I am of the opinion that the morning English lessons with our teacher, George, are worth filming and showing for many reasons.
Above all, they are enjoyable and interesting.
All of us participate .
Nobody is yawning or feeling bored.
I that the other lessons of other teachers aren't interesting.
I think we are lucky with our competent teachers.
Also the practical lessons of the cooking course level NVQ3 might be interesting with their delicious dishes of meat and vegetables.
The pictures would be amazing and wonderful.
There are many activities that could be filmed.
We can film our Swimming pool, .
It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff.
The gym is a good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipment that you have.
In addition, we can film the library, which possesses thousand of works, books on various subjects, with up-to-date facilities such as computers, the Internet, CDs and cassettes.
We shouldn't and neglect to film the buildings and the gardens of our beautiful college, especially if we take into consideration the fact that it is in the city of Shakespeare.
It will be good advertising, and will help to make the reputation of our college even better.
I'd like to say thank you for choosing me and sending me the letter.
I am extremely excited about the camp! For the camp, you need some information from me, don't you? Therefore I am going to write it down.
First, I'd like to travel in July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto in August.
Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible.
Second, I prefer log cabins to tents.
The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents.
However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents.
Third, I'd like to choose painting and surfing for the activities.
This is because I've been surfing since 1998 and I'm keen on surfing.
Also, painting is one of my favourite things! And I always wanted to learn how to paint.
Thank you very much for reading this letter.
I really appreciate your choosing me.
I am really looking forward to this camp.
Thank you.
Then, the day of the concert came! Can you imagine how excited we were? Our hearts were thumping and we were kind of nervous, however, there were a lot of things to do, so we started working.
Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thousands of fans came into this concert hall.
Everybody looked very excited about the concert.
Finally, the concert finished and we were thanked by this singer.
Also, we got some posters as well.
I'm writing to you with reference to the letter I have received from you saying I have won your competition.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for the prize, I will enjoy it a lot.
"Wuthering Heights" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very accurate summary in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man.
Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil ways.
He's the richest character of all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason for whatever happens to the other characters.
They are always suffering from the vengeance that Heathcliff is sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other characters have put him in.
From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated for his bad temper.
He's not good not because he was born with this tendency to harm but because the other characters have made him like that.
This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such "Wuthering Heights".
I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important aspect of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.
I would like to travel only in July, because I have only one month's holiday this year.
I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I think it is great fun and a bit more adventurous.
It is not too comfortable, but that is not a problem for me.
 I like this kind of holiday.
I am keen on photography so I would love to participate in this activity.
I am very good at it and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others.
I will also take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good opportunity.
I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of clothes I have to take with me and how much money, more or less, you think I should take.
Thank you for asking me about my preferences and for your concern.
As you know, last month I worked at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.
First I had to make the backdrop for the stage, so I made the background a sky with a lot of bright stars.
Then I put in some blue lights.
Furthermore I made some stars out of silver-coloured paper.
But that was only the beginning of my adventure.
I can't believe it yet! It was a wonderful experience.
I will remember that day for the rest of my life.
It was like a dream come true.
I wish you had been there with me.
I can't explain how great it was.
I stayed with him until the concert began and after the show I had the opportunity to stay in his private room with him and the other dancers.
Well, I have to leave you now, but I will give you more details when we next meet each other.
Last but not least, I would like to go sailing and climbing.
I have sailed a little in my youth but have never been climbing.
It would be a fun experience! Will I be needing any money? Please send me a list of required clothes and/or supplies.
Thank you very much.
Some people are boring to shop with, they don't talk or comment on anything they see.
Why would anyone shop with that type of person? Well, I really don't know.
Women, in particular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything they see.
If it is something they like, they always have to try it on.
We all know how it is when a woman tries on some clothes (usually several items) but that's still better than when we're talking about shoes! That has to be the worst.
Seeing or imagining a woman in the clothes she chooses can at least help when you are bored, but shoes are just shoes.
Shopping for them is a very long and tiring process.
It seems to last forever and just when you think she's done, she spots another pair.
I have just received your letter saying that I have won the competition.
I must say I was really surprised and happy to be given the opportunity to join the Camp for two weeks.
I would like to travel at the end of July, because at that time I will be finishing a degree in Art.
I am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while I am there.
Because of my studies, I will take painting, as this is the subject which I am finishing at college, , and photography which has been my hobby since I discovered that I can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
Concerning accommodation, I would prefer a tent since for me if I go to a camp or on an excursion it isn't the same if I sleep in a cabin.
Some people seem to enjoy going shopping and spending money.
It makes them happy.
But what about the queues you have to join to pay for something just to find, when you get to the front, that they have to close the till and they ask you to move to the next till.
What a waste of time.
It happened to me once.
I wanted to go on holiday, so I went to the travel agency.
In the window there were some good advertisements about holidays which were very cheap.
I really liked one of them concerning a holiday in Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, for only £250.
I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, I went to many shops just to get the same answer.
None of the adverts in the windows were available.
However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that advert out of the window they didn't do it.
, and don't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop.
I AM REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE PRIZE I'VE WON.
I'M WRITING TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED ME FOR AND, IF IT'S POSSIBLE, TO HAVE SOME FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE CAMP.
I WOULD PREFER TRAVELLING IN JULY, BECAUSE I HAVE MY EXAMS IN JUNE AND I'VE SIGNED A CONTRACT TO WORK AS A SHOP ASSISTANT, STARTING IN AUGUST.
SINCE I HAVE A CHOICE OF ACCOMMODATION, I'LL DEFINITELY GO FOR THE LOG CABIN, BECAUSE I CAN'T BEAR THE HEAT INSIDE A TENT.
OUT OF THE LIST OF ACTIVITIES GIVEN, I'VE CHOSEN GOLF AND PHOTOGRAPHY; GOLF BECAUSE I LOVE THE SPORT ALTHOUGH I DON'T GET TO PLAY IT MUCH (I'M NOT BAD AT IT), AND PHOTOGRAPHY BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN BUT I'VE NEVER HAD THE CHANCE.
 I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE WEATHER CONDITIONS, SO I CAN DECIDE ON WHAT CLOTHES TO TAKE, AND ABOUT COSTS, SO I CAN MAKE A BUDGET FOR THE HOLIDAY.
MY JOB MAINLY INVOLVED HELPING TO BUILD THE STAGE AND TO TAKE IT DOWN AFTER THE CONCERT, BUT I ALSO GAVE A HAND BACKSTAGE WHEN NEEDED.
I WAS PART OF THE STAFF.
WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED IN THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M.
WITH AN HOUR'S BREAK FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS THE SAME AFTER THE CONCERT.
I'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when I would like to travel, I would like to go anytime during July, because I have to be back home in August, because I need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
And referring to the question about which type of accommodation I prefer, I choose a log cabin, because I think that a tent is messier, so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin.
And my answer to the question about which activities I would like to choose, well I choose swimming, because it is my daily exercise, and surfing.
Anyway I'm not very good at surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can do it.
Oh, last I just would like to ask you how much clothing and money I have to bring with me.
And well, Mrs Helen, I would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions.
Thank you very very much and please keep in contact by e-mail, or normal mail.
I hope you are keeping in great shape, like you were the last time I saw you.
How is your family? I hope everyone is OK.
Well here in Dublin things are still the same, but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point, which is the big venue for events and concerts.
I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and everything else, and when I got to the Point, do you know who was there? Can you believe it, it was Moby.
So I went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'Would you give me a hand with my decks?' So I went, and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row.
Oh my God, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Well Kim, I hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.
Thank you for the news that I won the competition.
I'll try to answer your questions.
I would prefer to travel in July.
I have only this time, because my summer holidays are during these days.
To answer your question about living in tents or cabins, I would like to sleep in a tent.
A cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable.
That isn't what I want to have if I stay in a wild area.
My favourite sports are climbing and surfing.
I'm very good at climbing but for surfing I need some practice.
I hope I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply to my ones.
You won't believe what I did last month.
I was given the opportunity to the concert and of course I jumped at it.
First I arrived really early in the morning at the place, but the people were just working and I joined them.
My duty was to the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't very easy.
You always had some problems like not having enough wire or the lamps being broken by the transport.
The experience that I had was that I had never worked in such a perfect team.
I was able to ask anybody, and he answered in detail, although he had a lot of work.
After the hard work we had cool drinks, sat down on the ground and enjoyed the pop concert.
And as the pop stars thanked us for our hard work we all were a little proud to be here.
I am writing to reply to your letter about the competition.
Secondly, you asked me when I have time for travel, so I can only go in July, because I only have holiday in July.
And I would like to go in the first part of this month, the second part I spend with my family.
If you do not mind I would prefer a tent, because in a tent I will be alone.
While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing, because it is my favourite sport.
I am good at it - I have been sailing since childhood.
The second activity which I would like to do is surfing - I have never done it.
I would like to know how much money I must have with me? And what clothes I should take with me.
In my opinion this book 'The Old Man and the sea' is the best book which Ernest Hemingway wrote.
Thise book is about a man who knows that he will die soon, he knows that he didn't make his dream come true.
So he decided to go for a last trip in his life.
His goal is to get a Marlin.
He is very old, and he isn't so strong as he should be.
He needs to rest, but he doesn't give up.
In the end he makes his dreams come true, he catches a vast Marlin.
In this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
We must believe in ourselves.
 To sum up I must say that everyone should read this book.
I am really happy to receive your congratulations.
It was a very exciting moment and a very nice competition.
And now to win first prize! It is wonderful for me to have the opportunity to visit Camp California in the U.S.A.
In answer to your letter, I would like to travel in July for two reasons.
One's because I will have finished my exams by that time and the other is that in the first two weeks of that month I will go to Farnborought the Air show and the delegation from my country will be there.
And for the second question, about accommodation during these two weeks at the Camp, I would prefer a log cabin; because maybe it is more interesting to share with other people.
I would really appreciate it if you could answer these questions and .
Thanks very much, because .
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
People in general have a compulsion  to shop, in my opinion.
Because sometimes the article being bought is not really necessary.
We must accept that the media have an important effect on our lives, especially the T.V.
For men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of money buying clothes, cosmetics, accessories, jewellery etc.
And other times they sometimes choose just for the label.
, because people in general don't spend time preparing food and when they go shopping they choose pre-prepared food.
We know it is easier for those with a busy life.
On the other hand the facilities for access to the shopping center are not good.
The area for parking, space for children to play or bus station near the mall are not really adequate.
Otherwise shopping would be more enjoyable.
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
I received your letter yesterday.
I thank you for the opportunity your organisation has given me to go to the U.S.A.
The date when I would like to travel, it will be nice to go on the 1st of July, because my summer holidays  start at the end of June.
And I need a few days to prepare my stuff.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins because I have a lot of experience of putting up my own tents.
When I was in high school I used to be a member of the .
The activities that you have listed , some of them I am really interested in , especially painting.
Since I was young, my dad has always taken me to life drawing, so now it has become one of my hobbies.
And I think it will be nice to draw beautiful landscapes of the place.
Beside drawing, swimming is my favourite as well.
When I was in high school, I joined the swimming club.
And I also participated in a few swimming competitions.
Although I'm not the best, I have a lot of confidence at it.
Lastly there are some things I need to clarify, such as what type of clothes and how much money I need to bring.
I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable.
 people might think, why would I say that? because shopping is a very good entertainment, especially for women, like me.
, I like to shop.
.
I like to go window shopping the shopping centre.
It helps you keep up to date with what fashion is in now.
But during any peak season, like Christmas holidays or even during weekends, then I can say I definitely don't feel it is enjoyable, because of the crowds.
For me I think it is not shopping but a kind of suffering, especially queuing up for twenty minutes just to pay or waiting for the salesgirl to get the right size .
So sometimes I don't think shopping is enjoyable, and if there is any big holiday, I would rather stay at home and watch television.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I am happy that I won the first prize and I am looking forward to travelling to California.
- Time of travelling: because of the vacations and school holidays in Germany I am only able to travel in July.
Due to this fact I hope you can arrange it for me.
- Accommodation: a log cabin would be nice for me to stay in when I am in California.
You know that we are not used to living in such high temperatures in Germany as you have there in California.
I suppose I will have more fun if there is a cabin which is air conditioned.
If there are only tents available at this time it will not be a problem for me either.
- Activities: during my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing.
I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches.
I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too.
On the other hand I have no experience of surfing - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation.
Before we can give our opinions on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing .
'Shopping' means buying goods for your daily requirements, e.g.
food, clothes.
We do not speak here about luxury goods.
In this context, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently.
It is not enjoyable if you look on it as a duty.
But if you realize how important what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consciousness and more joy than before.
'Shopping' could be annoying if you look on it as a waste of time because you do it every day.
Reorganize your approach to shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the Internet and use e-business and online shopping to order your pants for example.
This is even a good way to get around the unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time.
Choose your clothes at home before you order them by e-mail! Another way to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.
You have been presented with some reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable.
There are ways of making it more fun.
It depends on every individual to change your mind and behave like a 'smart' shopper.
Thank you for confirming about the first prize in your competition.
I was pleased when I got it.
I hope I'll be able to travel in July, due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July.
I prefer to stay in log cabins , because I'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog.
I wonder if I can take them as well.
Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing.
I love swimming and also I've got a scuba diving licence.
I used to enjoy floating on the water whenever I was on holiday.
Singing is the most favourite hobby for us.
We often go out to sing in a Karaoke bar.
I'd like to know how much money, and how many clothes we need.
First of all, we can't go shopping without money.
Nowadays, most products' prices have gone up with our own country's economic development.
Despite the poor material of product, we have to pay a lot of money, even though we are completely satisfied with shopping at that time, we sometimes regret buying after the shopping.
It sounds foolish.
However it often happens.
Secondly, the service often makes us angry.
Of course, the shopkeepers are human beings as well.
So their attitude sometimes seems to be bossy and pushy.
I sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of their bad behaviour.
I am writing to answer the questions I have been asked in your previous letter.
I have decided I would like to visit Camp California only in July because I have already organized another trip for the month of August.
I would prefer sleeping in a log cabin if it's possible because I have back problems and I am not allowed to sleep on the ground.
I have also chosen as activities the options of Golf and tennis.
I am rather good at these sports because I have played them since I was a little girl.
I am better at tennis that at golf but anyway I have experience in both these sports.
I have also several simple questions.
I would like to know how much money I have to take and what type of clothes I need.
Do I have to take my tennis racquet and my golf bag with me? I would be very grateful to receive answers to my questions.
thank you.
I was in charge of the stage lights, you know, all those colourful lights that go all around the stage.
It was hard work and I had been practising for several weeks.
I had to learn what part of the stage had to be lit with a blue light and what part a green one.
Even though I ended up terribly tired I really enjoyed myself.
In your letter I received a few days ago, you asked me to give you some more information concerning my trip to the U.S.A.
I'm a teacher in Vienna.
My holiday starts on July 1st.
For August I booked a trip to Greece with my wife.
That's why it would be great if I could make that journey to the U.S.
in July.
I'm not really a young man and during the recent years of my life I accustomed to comfort.
Tents remind me of the time when I was in the army - I would prefer a log cabin for my stay in the camp.
Swimming is an activity I have done since I was a boy.
I still enjoy swimming, especially when it's in the sea, although I never took part in competitions, which means I go swimming just for fun.
The other activity I choose is photography.
Usually I just take holiday pictures to look at when I'm back home but when I have enough time - sometimes - I like to take pictures that have a slight touch of art....
I think there are no more questions.
I'm looking forward to seeing you.
I'm the teacher of the class in question.
The children are seven to eight years old.
The video that will be made should demonstrate what a day in school is like.
- The first lesson will deal with animals on a farm.
I will show pictures of animals and the children will tell me the names of the animals.
- Later on we'll sing the song "Old McDonald had a farm".
- Some sequences featuring the gym lesson should conclude the part of the film showing the children at work, but there should follow another short part that shows how the children have their lunch and spend their free time, what games they play in the schoolyard and how they interact with each other.
The most annoying thing about shopping is that in most cases you have to search for a particular thing for a long time and visit several shops before you find something that suits you.
Eventually, after long searching you find a skirt you like.
But it doesn't fit.
You get really angry trying to find a bigger one but unfortunately this is the last one.
And finally, after a few more hours, you buy the skirt of your dreams.
And suddenly you notice the identical but cheaper one in the next shop.
An accident like that can really make you livid.
At last you come back home, carrying the most beautiful skirt in the whole town.
You phone your friend to visit you and your friend comes, wearing a skirt not unlike the one you have just bought.
But that's life.
You can always go and buy a new one.
With regard to your letter, I would like to thank and congratulate you for making possible an event as wonderful as your competition.
If it is possible I'd prefer to spend the two weeks mentioned in your letter during July.
In August I'll be working, so it will be impossible for me to enjoy my prize during that month.
About the accommodation, from the two options, I choose to sleep in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
I would be grateful if you could send me further information about details like how much money or what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me.
Sorry for not having written to you in the last month.
You know that I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writing to you has been the accumulation of exams during this month.
There I was impressed by how a singer can cause such hysteria in teenagers.
During the two-hour concert we had to attend to thirty-six people who became unconscious after being trapped in the first row by the other people.
Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help at a concert avoid it if you can.
It's the best thing you can do .
I'm writing to you to reply to your letter asking for some more information about me, to give you all the information you need.
First of all you asked when I would be able to travel.
You ought to know that it is possible for me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole of August.
Answering the second question, I would prefer my accommodation to be in log cabins.
The reason is that, in my opinion, they are more comfortable, there's more space and in addition they are warmer.
Providing that you give me the chance to chose two activities, I would love to do swimming and singing.
I attend swimming and singing classes twice a week so I'm really good at both.
Don't hesitate to contact me with any more questions.
Basing my opinion on my experience, I'm going to talk mostly about clothes shopping.
There are some points that .
First of all, who is your companion? If you take your mum shopping the day, she has been doing housework all day, that will probably end in argument.
On the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, not having the size for you or too high prices.
Who would talk now about enjoyable shopping trips? I'm sure there would be plenty of people ready to do it.
I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition, and I am glad about it.
I am writing to give the information you asked me for and also I would like to request some information about the prize.
First of all I want to let you know I could travel only in July because it is the month that I have holidays from my school.
Furthermore I would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because I think it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the environment.
Also I would like to respond to your question about the activities I have to choose from your list: I would prefer painting and photography because I am not healthy enough for the other sports at the moment, and I think I used to do painting and photography very well at school.
Please, if you require extra information do not hesitate to contact me.
Dear Kim: I am sorry, I haven't written to you sooner but I am still excited about the experience I had helping Will Smith on the freeway last month.
Anyway, now I am going to tell you everything about it.
As you know, I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents' house, but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car.
It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it.
I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said, "Of course".
All right that's about all my news, soon and tell me about you.
I am writing to you in order to give you some details you asked me for in your letter.
About my accommodation preferences, I would really like to be in a tent.
Every time I travel around, I sleep in nice rooms with nice beds; that is why I think it is a good choice to sleep in sleeping bags.
From the activities I can choose to do in these two weeks, I would enjoy playing basketball and climbing.
I think it would be fun to play basketball after not playing for five years; and since I go out to the mountains once a month, I don't think I would have any problem with climbing.
As I told you in my last letter, I worked two weeks ago in Edinburgh helping at a pop concert.
The pop stars were all young people (between 23 - 30 years old), and all of them were really nice.
Our main tasks during those three days (I worked with 10 other young people) consisted in carrying musical instruments and loudspeakers, checking the lights and microphones, cleaning everything,...
The job was hard, but, from my point of view, it was worthwhile.
I have learned lots of things, earned some money for the summer, and the most important thing: I have had fun.
Every five working hours, we had thirty minutes' break to eat something.
We also had time to tell jokes and play with water balloons.
I hope your exams are going well, and you write back when you finish them.
I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July.
The reason is that I am a full-time student at Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of the semester, which is in June.
I hope that it is not a problem.
I would like you to know that I prefer a tent.
I think it is much better than a log cabin.
Especially in the summer when the temperature and humidity are very high.
From the list of all the activities I have chosen photography and golf.
Since secondary school I have been very interested in taking pictures and I have broad experience of it.
I have chosen golf because I have never played this game.
Please, send me any information about what I should take with me.
Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply.
Thank you for your latest letter.
It was really very nice.
I know that you're waiting for any information about the concert.
Here it comes...
My friend offered me a job as a member of the technical staff at Sting's concert.
I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew.
Our job was to prepare the stage.
We've built it using ready metal and wooden parts.
It was really big and impressive.
Then we had to plug in all electric instruments, speakers, lights and microphones.
I was working with a specialist who had to connect all the lights together to one computer and prepare a colourful show.
It was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure working with professionals.
It was a hard and complicated job but we all had a lot of satisfaction during the concert.
Even Mr.
Sting came to us to thank us for our help.
I am writing in response to the letter, which I received yesterday.
I am really pleased to win first prize in your competition, and, I am also pleased to give you the details which you would like to know.
First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel.
I am afraid that I am available to travel only in July, because I have to work all year except one month's holiday in July.
Secondly, I would appreciate it if I could stay in log cabins at Camp.
I feel that they would be fabulous places with a western design.
Most of all, I am really interested in doing two activities.
I am very good at Tennis.
However, I haven't any idea about sailing.
So, I would like to try both of them.
Lastly, I would be grateful if I could have the following information.
Thank you for your time and attention.
Referring to optional lessons, it was recommended that Speaking and listening, Computer and Business English are suitable for filming.
I feel that these are what students really prefer to learn.
There seems to be a general opinion that sports, art and music activities such as tennis, football, orchestra, painting, and photography should be included.
It can show how much students enjoy their life in our school.
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition.
I am very interested in spending two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
I would like to travel in July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I cannot sleep in a tent.
I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for .
I am good at those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend.
I would like to have more information about clothes.
I think that the weather is very hot and that the nights are not cold, but I do not know if I must take a lot of pullovers.
"Shopping is not always enjoyable" is a statement made by men in general.
Women like to go shopping, but not alone and they want to motivate their husbands.
Men do not like shopping, because their women buy a lot of clothes and it is very expensive.
Moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is , because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
I think that a child does not like shopping because he often has to wait, and I prefer to play with friends like these.
They go shopping only if they haven't any clothes.
I'm surprised to read that I've won the first prize.
So I will travel in July because I've only got some free time then.
I've got a lot of work and my boss won't allow me to leave my work at any other time.
I'm looking forward to hearing news from you.
We people are often depressed or suffer from stress.
What do we do then? We go shopping.
That often makes women feel better.
They go out with friends or alone.
But shopping is not always enjoyable.
A friend of mine was depressed because her boyfriend left her.
She phoned me and asked me about going shopping.
I agreed and we went shopping.
Just as we wanted to go out of a shop a man stopped us and held a pistol in his hand.
We were scared and so we did everything that he told us to do.
We are lucky that we are alive now.
The police came and took him to the jail (police station).
.
But you can be careful when you speak with he or she who is stealing your things.
I am writing this as a reply to your request to provide you with some information about my preferences.
First of all I'd prefer to travel in July, because it is the only month I have free.
I'll have to sit several exams in June.
In August my family are going to visit our relatives in Austria.
I am not so keen about the accommodation but would rather stay in tents than cabins.
It is much more fun and you can really enjoy nature and the company of your friends.
It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp.
I really enjoy swimming.
We live near the seashore and swimming is the sports activity I am really good at.
I am by far the best swimmer in my school.
The other subject is photography.
I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with others.
I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more than just good.
My best friend is crazy about shopping.
She prefers shopping to everything else.
She thinks that it is the most pleasant way of spending time, when you go from one shop to another, watching other people, looking at beautiful clothes, getting some fashionable ideas.
Sometimes I feel very sorry for her.
It seems that going shopping is a reason for living.
And there're so many people like her.
Lots of families plan a day out to go to a shopping centre, and it is a normal routine for them - to spend all day just shopping.
Not so many people think about going fishing or playing games with their families any more.
They have forgotten how beautiful the countryside can be, and you can only meet tourists in the castles or museums.
People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tired.
People do not smile at each other, do not talk to each other at the shops.
They look like robots who have to do their duty - to buy.
In my opinion shopping is just something to cover our basic needs.
Shops are .
Try to give up shopping one day and try to spend your day with friends, going to do something together.
It feels much better.
You'll have happy memories and be in a good mood.
To make a video in school, we should concentrate on the things we do most in a school.
The thing we do most in a school is have lessons.
It will be a very useful part of this video and should be the main subject.
The lessons we include in the video should be the main subject we study.
In the video I think we should take time to talk about what we do in our free time and study periods.
This is another important part of our school life, and we should include a section about lunch and After we talk about lunch, we should talk about the activities we are doing and .
At the end of the video, we should find one or two students sit together and ask them a few questions about how they feel about studying at the school? This is .
I am writing to reply to your letter saying that I have won the competition, which I can't believe.
I am so excited by the news.
I would like to have accommodation in log cabins as I find sleeping in tents very uncomfortable though it may be a new experience.
It would be nice to have a chance to try a new sport when we are relaxed.
I'd like to try golf because I'm not good at any other sports.
Besides golf, taking wonderful photographs of scenery has been my dream, even though I am a beginner.
Actually I didn't use to enjoy pop music much.
My classmate Cecilia persuaded me to try the whole new experience of helping at a pop concert.
I thought it would be the last thing I wanted, but it wasn't.
I've really enjoyed this opportunity.
We delivered so many fantastic and gorgeous costumes which had been designed exclusively by top designers.
We also helped to make posters and leaflets, which I enjoyed most as I always like drawing and designing.
The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many people from the countryside.
It was too complicated.
But the rest of the preparation was so good.
I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth.
They were so kind and modest.
Do you know what I liked most about this experience? I found pop music so wonderful, it changed my opinion that classical music is always best.
Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.
Thank you very much for the prize from camp California in America.
Regarding the time that I would like to travel, it must be in July only.
This is because my A-level exams are coming up so I really need time to revise, and July is the only month that I am free.
As to accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a tent.
This is because it is my first chance to see the outside world by myself so I need to gather up new experiences.
I have never ever stayed in a tent before but some of the people I know said that it is fun and much more exciting.
As I am a person who loves doing activities, I would like to choose to do sailing and photography.
I used to take a photography course at my school and my teacher taught me well about taking photos.
Also I have tried to sail before, but I am not good at it, but I would love to sail more.
Finally, I would like to ask about what kind of clothes I need to bring.
And about money, do I need much of it? Please, give me some advice about these things.
How are you? I have written to you to tell you about the greatest experience that I have ever had.
Last week I offered to help the others at the concert and it was amazing.
I couldn't believe how close I was to the band.
There were so many youngsters at the concert, but because I was the youngest in the team I guess that I was the luckiest at that moment.
The concert went very well and I enjoyed it so much.
Later on the band took a break for ten or fifteen minutes, so I served them with glasses of fizzy drink and chocolate bars, biscuits and sandwiches.
You will not believe how close I was to the singers.
After the break, the band had to carry on with the concert for another hour and a half.
People backstage, including me, were helping to clean up all the stuff and ready for the end of the concert.
When the band finished the concert, we had to serve them drinks again and help to clean the stage.
Afterwards, I had a chance to have photos taken with them and get their autographs etc.
It was an enjoyable time in my life and I wished that you were there with me.
Through this letter, I am sure that you will be able to share this experience with me.
I would like to travel in July because I have got my summer holidays from July to August and I work as a bank clerk in August.
I think a tent would suit my personal lifestyle better than a log cabin because I love nature.
I would like to play basketball during my holidays at Camp California because I love this game.
I have been playing basketball for 8 years and today I am a member of an Austrian basketball team.
But I have never played golf in my life though with your help I would be able to learn how to play golf and I think this could be very interesting.
I would also like to know how much money I will get from you for these two weeks because I would like to spend some money on clothes.
Last month I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and I think you want to hear some funny stories about the experiences I had.
At first I had to clean the three private rooms of the stars.
This was very boring but after I left the third room I met Brunner and Brunner.
These two people are stars in our country...
O.K.
I am just kidding.
I don't like Brunner and Brunner's songs because this kind of music is very boring.
I also had to clean the washrooms.
I will never ever help anybody to organise a pop concert again.
But after this servile work I met Eminem.
I think you know his popular songs like "My Name Is".
It was one of the greatest moments in my life.
I had to take him something to eat.
It was hard but also fun work.
You should try to get some experience at such a concert.
You would not regret it.
I have just read your letter and would be grateful if you could give me more information about the two weeks at camp California in the USA.
I am a nineteen-year-old girl who is still attending classes at Saint John's School.
For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses in painting.
I would appreciate it if I could travel in July because my school gives me two weeks' summer holiday.
As far as accommodation is concerned, I prefer staying in a log cabin.
I believe it is better than a tent because that would not provide enough shelter.
As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years.
I consider myself to be good at this sport.
As regards painting, I know a lot about it since my grandmother taught me when I was five years old.
It would be very kind of you to let me know about the clothes you think it will be necessary for me to take and how much money I will need.
I'm sorry I haven't written to you before but I have been very busy helping at Mano's concert.
Please write me as soon as you can.
I am writing to thank you for the letter with the result of the competition and also to ask some questions.
Firstly, I would like to inform you that I prefer travelling in July to travelling in any other month.
The reason for this is that July is the only month in which I am on holiday so I will not have to miss any classes.
Next, I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than stay in a log cabin because I appreciate having close contact with nature.
Therefore, I have chosen climbing and swimming as the two activities which I am good at.
I can say I am good at swimming, because in the club I used to be first in all the competitions and as for climbing I used to climb trees, walls, everything in my childhood without falling.
Since I am going to travel I would like to know how much money it would be advisable to take and what kind of clothing I should take.
I look forward to an answer from you.
I am just writing to tell you about my experience helping at a pop concert.
Wonderful, Breathtaking, Fabulous, these are some adjectives to describe just a little bit how my experience was.
Starting with good points, I could say that you could talk face-to-face with the pop stars.
Moreover, you had the unique opportunity to have your picture taken with them, to have their names written on your notebook by them.
Despite being tiring, it was rewarding because I noticed that all the singers are ordinary people who want to see their fans happy and satisfied and it is true I experienced that.
Another thing is that they pay you for your work and it is good money.
Don't worry because you don't pay for your ticket, it is "free".
From my point of view, there were no disadvantages.
Kim, summing up, it was the most interesting experience that I have ever had.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I was glad to hear from you recently and I really appreciate your invitation to California.
To start with, I would rather stay in a log cabin because two weeks might be too long to stay in a tent and a log cabin would be more convenient for me.
When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing.
I started surfing when I was 12.
So I am quite confident at this.
Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym .
In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular, especially in California.
And I also have to ask you what kinds of clothes will be suitable there.
Or approximately how much money would be enough to buy souvenirs because this will be the first time for me visiting California.
Finally, I must choose travelling there in July because I am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work.
Needless to say, shopping can cause you a waste of time and money.
However, some people might be opposed to this general understanding because they believe that they can find shopping enjoyable.
Those who love shopping usually suffer from serious stress and may seek out satisfaction by shopping.
However, things which you can get with money do not necessarily your dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be greater.
And shopping is also a difficult hobby to go along with your friends or your partners.
What you want is often different from what your friend wants.
Unless either you or your partner is really tolerant, shopping could result in another stress.
So it is advisable not to make a friend whose hobby is shopping.
In addition to these, everyone has regretted buying unnecessary things and those things would remind you what a silly decision you had made at that moment.
On the whole, shopping can be harmful rather than enjoyable because you might be extravagant, lose your friends and have what you don't need.
I am writing in reply to your letter I received yesterday.
At the beginning I would like to answer the questions you asked me in your letter.
The most suitable month for me to travel is July because my boss promised to give me this month off (I am in charge of a project which starts in June so I am sure I couldn't go later).
'As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list.
So I decided to choose climbing and photography.
These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time.
I am very keen on photography.
Last year I took part in a photographer's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the category of ,,beautiful scenery''.
Climbing, in contrast, is something I started a few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport.
But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it.
I would like to ask about clothes.
Do I need any formal ones? I would also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A.
is.
I want to thank you once more for in your competition.
Have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking through shelves and not finding that in the end.
What did you feel? You had to be disappointed.
There are a lot of situations which could make you feel similar while you do shopping.
You might spend too much money and buy something you don't really need.
You could also buy something which later turns out to be broken.
So you have to complain about it.
Very often a shop assistant is not helpful so you lose your money and your time.
Moreover, you could face an aggressive and maybe even drunk shop assistant or manager.
This leads to an escalation of your anger.
Sometimes you could find a bargain.
You are happy to buy a dress or a suit for a good price.
But at home you notice that there is a tear on the sleeve.
And you couldn't of course take it back because the price was lowered and your dress is not under guarantee.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I am very happy about having won the competition.
I have several things to tell you and some questions about the camp.
First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer.
I have exams in June and a job in August.
Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to it.
I have already been to other summer camps and I always choose this accommodation.
I find it more sociable than a log cabin.
I have chosen from the activities offered to do photography.
I have already been a member of a photography club so I am experienced.
I also would like to do climbing but I have never done it before.
Thank you very much for all these details.
First, I had to spend all of the day before the concert in the field where it was to take place.
I had to prepare the stage a little but, as I was not a profesional, I did not do much with the instruments.
I tried to play the drums but I was thrown off the stage by a member of the group who was in a bad mood.
I made sandwiches for all the staff for a major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the audience all evening.
I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage.
As I was a volunteer I did not have to pay to watch the concert and after it I spent the rest of the night with the members of the group.
That was the best.
As you mentioned that I have won the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
- here is the information that you require.
I can travel only in July because during this month I am free to go anywhere.
Actually it is my summer holiday.
Apart from that I wouldn't mind at all whether I stay in tents or log cabins but if I have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation.
It is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
The activities that I'd like to do: the first one would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well because I used to be a basketball player in my high school; the second activity would be tennis.
I am not an expert at this because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like that; serving the ball, backhand and forehand to hit the ball.
This information should be enough for you but if you'd like to know more about anything please ask me and do not hesitate.
I'm looking forward to it and I hope to see you this summer.
Sometimes when you ask your friend, especially girls, "What would you like to do after the class or during the weekend?" the typical answer would be 'I'm going to the shop because I like it, even window shopping would be fine'.
However, for me shopping is not always enjoyable.
Why? First of all, it wastes my time, especially when I can't find the thing I want.
This is very frustrating.
In addition, it's so tiring to walk around the place over and over to find the thing you want.
Apart from that, it's quite annoying when you have to compare or to the price in order to buy the cheapest one, if possible.
Once you've got everything on your shopping list, you also have to carry all the bags that you just bought, which are very heavy sometimes.
I'm happy to hear that I have won the first prize.
Here is the information you want from me.
Firstly, I can only go in July, because I'm on holiday at that time.
I think I would prefer , because it is more safe, and I wouldn't like to be in the log cabins.
The activities are quite hard to choose really, because you have a lot of choices which I like.
But I think I will choose Basketball and Photography, because basketball is the only sport I can play well.
Photography is a very interesting activity, and is not too hard to do either.
Finally, I hope the information I've given is useful for you, and hope you can answer my questions A.S.A.P.
 Shopping is very important for most people because you need to get the stuff you need or you want.
For some people it may be a way to relax , after you have been to work or school.
So it is a thing you will enjoy most of the time, but still .
It depends on .
For example, some people always shop to get food or stuff they need in everyday life.
They won't enjoy this kind of shopping, because it is not getting what they want.
The place where you are shopping is also very important.
For example, in HK , because there are too many people it makes you want to stay home and you won't enjoy shopping.
Now I've written this composition, I think that you will enjoy shopping most of the time, but still find sometimes you won't.
I am writing in reply to your letter congratulating me for winning the first prize in your competition and inviting me to Camp California in the U.S.A.
I was delighted to hear from you and am already looking forward to spending two weeks in California.
I am afraid that the only possible time for me to travel is in July because it is the only month I am able to get time off work.
Regarding accommodation I would prefer sleeping in a tent because I enjoy the closeness to nature while camping a lot.
I am looking forward to your reply at your earliest convenience and to getting to know you personally in July.
It was my job to help to keep all the little kids out of the backstage area.
Therefore I got to stay backstage all the time and to see all the members of the "Backstreet Boys".
Yes, that was the best thing about the concert but I actually just enjoyed the whole experience of being part of the crew.
I sort of felt like I had done my part to make the concert a success.
Do you know what I mean? Anyway, I've got to study now.
We've got a maths exam tomorrow.
I have received the good news and I'm very happy because I have always wanted to go to California and now it's really happening, so, thank you very much for that.
First of all, I would like to give you some further information about me and secondly, I'd like to ask you about some concerns that I have.
About when I would like to travel, I think that my answer will be easy for you, because I have two months off, those are July and August, so my trip should be .
Regarding my accommodation I would like to stay in a tent because I remember my holidays in the south of Peru, a long time ago; it was wonderful.
With regard to the activities at the Camp, I would like to choose basketball and photography, because I think that basketball is a very good sport for training your muscles and I used to play in a league in my country.
It's hard but at the same time lovely.
The other choice has been made because I like very much to discover different places and with a camera it is possible to do that easily.
Yours faithfully.
I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much.
, she told me that you are very keen to know about my experience, so I'll give you some information in this letter that I'm sure you will be glad to have, even though you have not been to the concert.
First of all, I'll tell you that on the day of the concert I woke up at 6:30 a.m., very early for me.
You know me, I'm lazy.
The work began around 8:30.
It was very hard but then the band came to rehearse.
From that moment I enjoyed working until the concert had finished.
The atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
During the concert I listened to the band like everybody else, besides I earned money, so it was a wonderful experience.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
.
I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition.
I am writing in order to give you all the details that you need from me.
Finally, I would like you to tell me if I will need some special clothes.
If the answer is yes, could you tell me what kind of clothes I will need.
One other thing, it would be useful to know if I will need to take with me some extra money.
If the answer is yes, could you tell me how much money I will need to take with me.
I look forward to receiving your reply.
Activities connected with the social programme, such as international evenings, sing-along parties and indoor games.
Ordinary lessons attended by students of different levels of ability.
Ordinary lessons are a good way of showing the relationship between students and teachers.
Thank you for your letter.
I am very happy to have won your competition.
In order to confirm my schedule for the trip I have won in your competition, I am writing some information to you below.
I would like to go to "Camp California" in July because I will have to produce "Mission Impossible III" from August.
I will be busy deciding everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there.
I would prefer to stay in tents as accommodation because it sounds thrilling and even for me, and also I have never tried this kind of accommodation before.
I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis.
To produce a film is very hard work.
I must keep in good condition to make a masterpiece.
Swimming is really nice for relaxing and I can do exercise for a long time.
On the other hand, tennis stimulates my body and soul.
It is good for my inspiration.
I enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month.
There were a lot of people.
I carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost their way.
It sounds really bad but I enjoyed this pop concert to my heart's content.
I am very happy to know that I have won the first prize in your competition.
Now I can realize one of my dreams.
I can give you all the information that you need.
I prefer to travel in July because it is the only month I can have two weeks' holiday.
For the accommodation I prefer to have a log cabin because I have some problems with my back and I need a bed to sleep in.
I can do two activities during my stay at the camp.
The first one I have chosen is swimming.
I have a good level of proficiency in swimming and I entered some competitions last year which I won.
For the second activity I have chosen photography.
I have taken a photography course over the last two years so I am able to take some beautiful pictures.
You want to hear about my experience of helping at a pop concert.
You can't imagine how fun it was! You could do so many things because you received a free pass which allowed you to go where you wanted and that was what I liked about this experience.
I really enjoyed serving the drinks to the pop-stars.
You could speak to them and you could see that a lot were very cool and the other ones were .
And you heard the concerts too.
After the concert I had to clean the area and it took a long time because people had behaved like pigs.
But I was chatting and laughing with other workers.
Write to me soon.
I have just received the letter, which lets me know that I have won the first prize.
I am proud of winning it and would like to say how grateful I am.
I am therefore writing to give you my further information.
First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July.
This is because I intend to take an examination in September.
So I can afford to go on holiday only in July.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents.
It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.
The next consideration is the activities.
Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident at it.
And recently, I have been practising tennis as a school activity.
Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis.
Finally, I am wondering about what kind of clothes I should wear and how much I need.
I would be most grateful if you could give me further information.
Hello! I hope everything around you is alright.
You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much.
So I'm now writing to let you know how great it was.
All the work I needed to do wasn't very interesting.
I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely.
The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising.
I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage.
Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as a member of the audience.
It was absolutely fantastic.
I had ever never sat down there.
Additionally, you won't believe it, but the vocalist said "All the chairs you are sitting on were set out by him," pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory.
Anyway it was so interesting a time that I didn't even feel tired after that.
Finally, I suggest you should try as I did if you have any opportunity.
You are sure to like it.
Thank you for your letter.
I was very surprised that I have won the first prize in your competition.
First I would like to mention that I can only travel in July, because I will work in August in a web designer's studio.
So I am unable to go on holiday at any other time.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because I like camping very much.
I think it's more exciting to be in a tent than in a log cabin.
I played Basketball at school for about two years.
I am rather good at it.
I also had Painting as my main subject at school for five years.
I like painting very much, and I think I am good at Painting.
I paint a lot in my free time.
I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy pictures.
First I would like to point out that it was a good idea to our school in a short film.
I think first of all we should film an English lesson, where pupils could prepare some group work or information boards.
I think it is also important to present a business English lesson.
Maybe the pupils could write "offers and orders" or enquiries on the blackboard.
Next I would film a BWPM lesson.
This subject teaches the pupils how to make good presentations.
They get together in groups, then they prepare power-point presentations and finally they present it in front of the other pupils and teachers.
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the break.
The smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at their tables doing their homework.
I think then we should film an information-technology lesson.
It would be funny to show the computers, which are often , and often the .
It's really funny to see the helpless teacher, who wants to go on working in Excel or Word , while the computers do not work or break down.
I think that would be all for our video.
In my opinion these are the most interesting things in our school.
I am writing to answer all the questions that you asked me in your last letter.
First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition.
It is very important for me, because I have always wanted to travel to the U.S.A.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because, as I have never slept in a tent, it would be a new experience for me.
The two activities that I choose are: basketball and climbing.
I am a very good basketball player because I have been playing basketball since I was six years old.
On the other hand, I have never climbed a mountain but I always wanted to do it.
I wondered what kind of clothes I should take to the camp and I wanted to know how much money I should take.
I look forward to knowing the dates of the camp.
First of all I would like to thank you.
Now I am going to give you some further information: I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is the most important year of my life.
I am studying for the university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then at the end of June I will have the university entrance exam and after that, in July, I am going to be alright.
I'm writing to you in reply to your letter.
I was really surprised when I opened it.
I look forward to going to the Camp California in the USA.
I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me in August and I will have to look after them.
I prefer staying in tents to staying in log cabins, because it reminds me of my childhood.
I used to go with my friends to a camp, which was situated by the seaside.
We always enjoyed ourselves.
Never had I had such a great time.
From your list of activities I choose sailing and climbing.
I'm keen on sailing, it is my favourite sport.
I find it very appealing.
I have been sailing since my father bought a boat in 1980, when I was only five years old.
However, I have never taken part in any competitions connected with this sport.
For me it is only a hobby.
Last year I took up climbing and I want to carry on learning this sport.
I would like to ask what kinds of clothes I should take with me, and I wonder if prices are high there.
I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantages of this activity.
Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything they want.
It isn't true.
Nowadays we have many big shopping centres.
We like them because everything is in one place.
The most suitable time for shopping is the weekend when parents don't work and children haven't got school.
Because of that, shopping centres are overcrowded.
You can't buy something in a peaceful and calm atmosphere.
In addition, in this kind of shops prices are very high, of course not all of them.
However such centres are very useful and necessary.
In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremely long queue for the changing room.
It is really exhausting.
Afterwards you are all in.
Nevertheless sometimes shopping can be enjoyable.
If you bought something gorgeous, you will be very happy.
On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you are in a bad mood don't go shopping.
I am writing concerning the trip I have won in your competition.
I would prefer a log cabin and I hope that then I will have enough room for all the things I will bring with me.
Unfortunately, I do not have my own camera.
In spite of this, I have got all the equipment I need for painting and I paint very well.
I went there at 10 o'clock in the morning.
Then a young man told me what to do.
First of all I had to carry all the bottles into the bar and later I helped some other people to get the instruments in the right position.
It was really hard work.
At one o'clock I had a break.
At this point I promised myself that I would never do this awful job again.
The food was delicious and fortunately I did not have to pay for it.
I think it would be a good idea if we two did this job together next year.
Today I received your letter.
It is the most wonderful news I have heard in a long time.
I am so pleased that I won this prize that I cannot explain how grateful I am.
I wasn't expecting this prize because it is too good to be true.
My family .
Because of this situation I will be very busy in the first week of July, and I would appreciate it if you could give me the option to begin my "Camp California" experience on July 10th.
About the accommodation I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I have never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins.
Because I have seen my father playing golf since I was a child I am very keen on this sport, and also I love photography because I have got a great camera.
I am really looking forward to seeing you soon.
When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her was a nightmare.
It is amazing how people change over the yearsFor example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something.
I enjoy fashion so much that my life has changed completely since I started to study fashion design and I discovered that fabrics, and colors, are really enjoyable.
But these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price.
I find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
Anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
I was enthusiastic about receiving your letter.
I will give you all the necessary information.
I would like to travel in July because during that period I will be free from work.
My current post finishes at the end of June but I will start another job at the beginning of August.
I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin, because it would be a new experience for me and I would like to try something different.
As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen to do tennis and swimming.
I am good at playing tennis and I have been learning to swim for three months so it could be useful training for me.
I want to thank you for this prize.
Let me know if you need further information.
In your last letter you asked me about the concert...
oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working at a concert was great.
You can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert.
Apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security...
it was so exciting! My work consisted in checking the tickets, the number on them and taking people to their seats.
Now I have to go.
Write soon and let me know what you have been doing.
Thank you for your letter.
I am very pleased to see that I have won the first prize in your competition.
I am going to answer your questions.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have some holidays during that month.
I am working the rest of this summer.
You also asked me about two activities.
I choose singing because I love singing and I have been in a choir for 7 years now.
I also choose climbing.
Unfortunately I am not so good at it.
But I would take the opportunity to improve .
In addition, I have some questions.
I would like to know what sort of clothes we have to take with us and also how much money is necessary.
Our life today is increasingly about consumption.
You always find more shops and they are open even later.
You can't live without shopping but shopping is not always enjoyable.
Firstly, if you try to do your shopping during the rush hour, it could be very difficult.
Everybody is stressed.
You have to join the queue.
It is not pleasant at all.
In addition, everything is now so expensive that you have to compare the prices.
You have to find which shop offers you good quality products for a good price.
Sometimes some goods are expensive but of a very bad quality.
And it is not an easy task if you have to complain about the quality.
Most of the time the shop assistant doesn't believe you.
In conclusion, I can say that shopping is not the most enjoyable task you could find.
Of course you also have some good aspects but most of the time it is very unpleasant.
You could try to do your shopping via the Internet.
Perhaps you will find it less inconvenient.
I am really astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I want to say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California .
I have never been to California before.
Now I will give you some further information: I have to travel in July because I have to make sure that I can have a holiday this year and it is my only option! I am sure you can understand this.
I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am not good at either activity, but it will be a pleasure to try them, especially surfing.
I would like to feel the wind in my hair, and enjoy how quickly the board goes over the sea.
We have recently had a discussion in our class about this statement.
We have had a great deal of arguing.
Certainly it is great to buy new clothes and have a great variety at home to wear, but mostly you will never have enough.
When I decide to go shopping, first I will make sure that I have enough time.
I am not a typical woman because I hate shopping! I am lucky if I find something which fits.
I've received your letter and I am pleased to have won because I needed some days to relax and to leave the city, which is very stressful.
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the month he can give me one, so I hope that isn't a problem for you.
I would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent, that's, in my opinion, a way to be nearer the environment and the animals, although I don't mind staying in log cabins.
In spite of liking all the sports you wrote about in your letter, I am only good at climbing and sailing, because I used to do them with my father when I was a child.
I have got a doubt, it is not very important, but I would like to know if I need any money or if everything is paid for, the kind of clothes I should wear, if the weather is good or bad...
and all the extra information you can send me.
In my opinion the majority of people who go shopping are women who must buy food and other kinds of things for their families, so, for them, shopping is a very boring activity that is repeated every day and that drives them crazy when they have to choose the best product and the cheapest price to save some money.
On the other hand, there are people who think the opposite, such as: children, teenagers, men; but not always, because they hardly ever go shopping - only when they need clothes, or something for their job or school.
In that way shopping can be as much fun as you want, although if you do it very often, it will .
To sum up, everything you do in small quantities is good and fun, but don't increase the amount you do if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beginning of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes.
Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent, because I got used to being in tents since I spend my holidays every summer with my friends in the hills.
In addition, I would prefer playing tennis.
When I was younger I won the National Tennis Championship.
I also like surfing.
I think it is a dangerous sport, but I know how to do it, because of the fact that last year a professional surfer taught me.
From my point of view, shopping is not always enjoyable, because sometimes when you are looking for a special item you never find it.
Besides, I do not like to waste my time just looking at a wide variety of products, that makes you feel confused, and you don't know which item fits you, instead of being with my friends or doing something else.
I think that when you want to buy something you have to be sure of what you really need, if not the shop assistant has the ability to persuade you to buy something you do not want.
Especially in the shops that sell fashionable clothes.
Although it is wonderful to buy new things, there are times when it really becomes tiring.
To summarize, I would say that if you want to buy something, first make sure what sort of product you need and then go shopping.
If you don't shopping will never be enjoyable, but only tiring and boring.
Whenever I walk in the street, I always want to go into every shop.
I always want to buy T-shirts, Jeans, Skirts, cosmetics, haribands, accessories, rings, earrings, bracelets, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationery, interior stuff and CDs.
But it is impossible to buy everything at the same time.
I have to choose some of them and I have to give up buying most of them.
Before I go out , I make a plan.
I decide what it is I want to buy and I decide to buy some items.
But if you think positive about shopping, it will make you the happiest and the richest man in the world.
During this exciting holiday I would prefer staying in a log cabin.
The reason for this is that I have  difficulty sleeping in tents.
When I was at the university I was very keen on basketball and I played for the university team.
In 1998 we were the champion of the First National League.
Also I am quite a good swimmer.
I think that is because of my long legs.
So I would love to take part in basketball and swimming activities while I am at the camp.
Nowadays our shopping habits seem to have changed.
I can clearly remember my childhood and our only local shop.
Yes! There was only one shop in the area where I used to live until we moved to Oxford.
I was really astonished by all these shopping centres, like ASDA, HOMEBASE, etc.
One day I decided to go to the shopping centre which is only 40 metres from our house.
Firstly, I could not find the entrance.
I'd walked around for about 15 minutes until I found the door.
I realized that I'd walked so many times in front of the entrance but the door had looked like a window.
When I entered the shop I was a bit angry.
I started looking for the food products listed on the piece of paper but I found only the eggs, milk and bread.
Nothing else.
So what was all that about?! I wasted 2 hours buying food which you can find in every local shop.
Thank you for your letter.
I was so happy to hear that I have won a two-week holiday in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July.
I am going to finish my exams in June, and I am planning to go back to China in early August.
So if I could travel in July, and come back before the 6th of August, that would be great.
I would prefer staying in tents to log cabins.
I have never had any experience of staying in a tent, so I would like to give it a go.
I think I will enjoy myself in a tent.
I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming.
I really want to learn how to swim.
I was wondering if there is a coach who could give me a lesson at the Camp.
Also, I would like to join the basketball team.
I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team has won many competitions during the last ten years in our city.
I am glad I have taken part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team.
It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine at your place.
You wanted to hear about my experience at the pop concert which I enjoyed helping at last month? I must say that was great fun.
I'd never had this kind of experience before.
Before the concert actually started I had to give out lots of leaflets.
They were lists of pop bands and groups which would appear in the concert in order, and some information about their performance and backgrounds.
After that, I had to help people who had a ticket but couldn't find their seat.
During the concert, I didn't have a lot to do, so I had a chance to see most of the performance.
That was excellent.
I was excited that I had a closer look at so many famous pop stars.
During the break time I did give a lot of directions to people who couldn't find the toilet, and gave people information such as where they could have a cup of coffee.
That was a bit boring, but it was part of my job.
I have got to go.
.
First of all, I'd like to travel in July because I have to work every month except that month.
July is the only month that I can be free.
I prefer staying in tents because it is an unusual experience for me.
Also I'd like to have the chance to play tennis and try sailing at the camp.
Talking about tennis, I used to play it for about five years when I was a child.
I think I'm much better than a beginner.
But I never had a chance to enjoy sailing.
I'd like to try this time.
Now, I have two questions about camping.
First, what clothes should I bring? Is it hot enough? I've never been to California, therefore please let me know about the weather there.
Second, how much money do I need? I haven't a clue about it.
I'd like to know some examples.
As I mentioned before, I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month.
The artist's name was "Bonny Pink", who is famous in my country.
I could enjoy her music very much.
My job was looking after her when she had a break time.
I guided her to a rest room and served her a cup of tea, and so on.
I thought it was a most exciting job.
Actually, I could have a chance to ask her about music, her favourite artist and her hobby.
I was impressed when I heard that she liked doing puzzles alone.
She seemed to be a very active woman when she was singing but at the same time she had a very gentle attitude when she spoke to me.
I became a fan of her.
It was a very interesting experience for me.
I wish you had been there.
But don't worry Kim, I'll send you a copy of her CD for you.
I hope you can enjoy it.
Anyway it's time to go to bed.
Take care of yourself, Kim.
I'm waiting for your letter.
First, I was wondering if I could travel in July.
I am working at a language school.
Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July.
Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there.
Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' as my activities at the Camp.
I have been playing tennis for over ten years.
In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years.
I took up taking photos four years ago.
Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times.
Last month I helped at a pop concert.
The name of the band was 'Dream Comes True'.
This band is very famous not only in Japan but also in the USA.
I am still excited while I am writing to you about my experience.
First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived.
The musical instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them in the right position on the stage.
They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important to the band.
After that I helped to test lights and microphones.
I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage.
I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.
The most exciting thing about my experience was that the band spoke to me after the concert.
The band was very satisfied with the stage and appreciated our work.
I was so excited and happy that I can't remember what I talked with the band about.
Firstly, the most suitable month would be July because I am very busy with my work now, and my children are on holiday then.
Secondly, I prefer to stay in log cabins, because they are more comfortable.
I confess that I have never been in a tent and I have never had any intention of doing it.
The activities are really interesting and I would take part in Painting and Climbing.
I am not very good at painting, but I choose it because it is a good opportunity to do it.
Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body.
I don't want to disappoint you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges.
I would appreciate it if you could give me a couple of ideas about the clothes I will need there.
Thanks in advance.
Not only are bad characters in a story more interesting than good ones, but also they hold your attention.
In this book, Heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived through with the Earnshaw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
Heathcliff used to play with Catherine.
They were good friends but Heanly, Catherine's brother, hated Heathcliff.
Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason, he sent Heathcliff to work on the farm.
In the meantime Catherine met Edgar Linton and in the end she married Edgar because of he money and good education.
Thank you very much for your kind letter.
I was very surprised at the result of the competition.
Now I am happy to give you all the information you need.
I think it would be better for me to travel in July.
I will start an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave then.
In your letter you ask me to choose between tents or log cabins.
Well I prefer to stay in a log cabin.
It is more comfortable and I am afraid of wild animals.
I saw you offer a lot of activities.
That's fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like most and I can also do best.
I think I will choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church choir and I do it very well.
The other activity I like very much is swimming.
I have taken part in a lot of competitions.
Now I would like to ask you if we need some money and if it is necessary to take with me special clothes.
I hope I have given to you all the information you need and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
I am happy to tell you about the experience I had at the pop concert last month.
I had to start very early in the morning, at 7.30.
First we had to prepare the stands with food and drink and buy something which had been forgotten.
Then we had to turn on the and decorate the whole room.
In the afternoon the singers came in and I also could have an interview with Ricky Martin.
I was very excited! He is very beautiful! At the end of the interview he invited me to have dinner with him after the concert.
I naturally accepted.
I particularly liked the interview.
Before the concert started, we had to check all the musical instruments.
The microphones all had to be checked.
Fortunately we had no problem.
The concert was a success.
I was very proud of myself and the work I had done.
After the concert I left with Ricky Martin.
We went to a nice restaurant and enjoyed dinner together.
I am sure, my dear Kim, I will never forget that wonderful experience.
Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit about your adventure .
 I am writing in reply to your letter informing me that I have won a prize in your competition which is two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I would be really happy if I could choose singing and photography from activities you have listed.
Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5.
I could say that I am quite good at it.
Also, I used to assist my brother, who is a professional photographer, so I consider myself fairly experienced.
I would like to ask you whether going there in July is possible.
I am afraid that July is the only possible month, because I am due to start work in August.
Finally, I would like to ask you for further information about the spending allowance and the clothes which I should take.
I'm sorry I haven't written for so longbut I've been quite busy just recently.
Last month, I helped out at a pop concert, which I really enjoyed.
The singer who performed wasn't one of my favourites, but having the opportunity to experience being a member of staff there was just amazing.
I was just behind the stage.
I was supposed to help my friend with the lights, so I could see all the crowd screaming like mad.
I even saw crying girls who were trying to reach the pop singer.
Do you know what Kim, I've never thought before that enjoying yourself like this could be weirdly .
I think you never realize this until you're not a part of the crowd.
But I'm really happy that I had even a small role in helping people enjoy themselves.
I mean, all those flashing lights, with their changing colours, I believe they helped a lot.
Even though I was just telling my friend what the next composition of colours was, I consider myself to have been very .
And finally, the greatest news: I was introduced to the singer by my friend, who works for him.
This was maybe the best part of being there.
He was so nice and he even gave me his picture with his signature on it.
I suppose I will never forget that night.
That's about all my news, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you very much for this opportunity.
I'd like to travel only in July, because, for the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank.
The second reason is the weather.
I love travelling when the weather is warm.
Regarding the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable for me and my family.
I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in a log cabin.
I'd like spend all of my time in a swimming pool because I love swimming.
I also like surfing, because I love the wind in my hair and .
I have only one question about the baby's accommodation.
May I have a babysitter? I'd like to have more free time for myself and my health.
Let me say thank you again.
How are you? I'm fine.
I'm sorry I didn't write to you before, but I was so busy with my exams.
First of all, I want to tell you what happened last month.
Do you remember which is my favourite group? So, you won't believe me, but I enjoyed helping at an Oasis concert.
It was a great and wonderful experience.
The group needed to find a good microphone for the concert, because the singer lost his microphone last concert.
Me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when I understood what was happening on the stage, I decided to help them.
Of course you know I'm a singer, so I came back quickly to my home, I picked up my microphone, and I handed it to the singer.
First of all, I would like to travel only in June, given that my wife will come with me; her holidays are only in June.
Concerning accommodation at Camp California, would it be possible to stay in a log cabin? My wife is afraid of sleeping in tents.
 I play basketball in a famous French club; that is the reason why I would like to choose the basketball.
If I had to choose another activity, I think I would do photography.
In fact, this activity seems to be very interesting.
Unfortunately, I have never tried but I feel like trying it.
After having thought about this video and asked various people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take up a great part of a day at school; this being in three parts.
After that we could go to lunch, which takes two hours per day.
The best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnel because they are very nice.
We could begin the afternoon with sport, showing the different with their surroundings (): it would give a good impression.
I advise finishing with a chemistry lesson so that people see the laboratory.
Before that, I would have shown the break at 3 o'clock, which is important for us.
I am writing to give you the further information about myself.
I was very glad to hear that I had won the competition.
First of all, I can only travel in July.
I have a summer holiday from the end of June to the beginning of September as I am a student, but I am planning to work in August in a part-time job.
So that's the reason why I cannot travel in August.
I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabins because I have been camping once and I stayed in tents.
It was great to have fun and also .
As you said I will have the opportunity to do two activities.
I am quite good at singing and I have a talent for singing that means I can entertain people by singing.
In addition I am keen on swimming but actually I am not very good at swimming because I have just started to learn to swim but I have really been enjoying it and I think it will be a good chance to improve my swimming.
In fact, I have some questions about how much money I will need, what else I have to bring with me and .
Once again, I am very happy to have such a good opportunity and I hope this letter tells you what you want to know about me.
Thank you for your attention.
These days, there are so many people who like shopping that it is one of the important parts of our life.
It is not, however, always enjoyable and there are both advantages and disadvantages.
There are, in contrast, disadvantages at the same time.
When we are  shopping, we often find that the place where people often go for shopping is too crowded and it makes us more tired.
Also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
In addition, shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly.
The customer can never know what price is the normal one unless they have the same shop or the same thing.
To sum up, shopping is a very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we cannot find only advantages to it.
I am really looking forward to going to California and I would like to go in July, because I am going to have my summer holidays in that month.
About accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I have a problem with my back.
Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed.
Also tents are not very comfortable.
As far as camp activities are concerned, I have been doing windsurfing for 5 years and, for that reason, I am fairly interested in sailing.
On the other hand, I am keen on painting, however, I have never painted in my life, so I would like to try it.
I received your letter two days ago and I'm quite happy to know that you passed F.C.E.
I'm ok and let me tell you about my recent experience.
I went to Madrid last week and I was walking in the street when somebody asked me for an address.
I looked at him and I realised that this person was David Bowie.
Yes!!! I couldn't believe it.
He was trying to speak in Spanish, but his accent was terrible.
So, I started to speak in English with him.
I explained to him where the street was that he was looking for and we carried on with the conversation for a while.
I thought he was very rude, but I was wrong, he isn't arrogant at all and he looks very .
Well my friend, I have to go, because I have got an appointment with the Dentist.
Write to me soon and take care.
I'll give you the necessary information about me.
The most suitable time for me is July because in August I intend to go to the countryside, where I have a small farm.
In September my school starts a new study year.
So, because of that I can only then.
I'd like to stay in the log cabins, because I don't like wet places like tents after rain.
You offer me a lot of activities.
I play basketball and tennis very well.
I want to try surfing and climbing because I've never done it.
You'd like to know how the Top-Pop Concert was, which I helped to organise last month.
It was absolutely great! I was responsible for the security of one of the sectors.
I gave information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points.
I was also asked about the timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, knives and so on in bags.
Although I worked I watched the concert.
It was great fun! People danced, screamed and sang with the singer.
I looked very carefully at the organisation of the event, you know I'm interested in it.
OK.
I'd better stop now because I'm going to go to the library.
I was so surprised to hear from you.
I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize in the competition.
I'm so happy because it is the first time that I have won something.
Here is all your information.
I would like it if I could have my vacation in July because it is the only time of the year that my employer will let me have a vacation.
As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it will be the first time that I've been camping and I would like to see .
I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities as well.
I would like to choose swimming and climbing.
I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing.
That's why I chose it because I want to try something new.
Finally I would like to ask you about my clothes and what the weather is going to be like and what kind of clothes I must take with me.
That is all.
Everyone has likes and dislikes.
But no one does what he likes all the time.
There are times when you have to do something even if you don't like it, and times when you are doing what you like but not at the time you would like to.
What I'm trying to say is that I like to shop but I can't do that all the time.
First because I'm not so rich and second because I don't enjoy shopping all the time.
Nothing in life is always enjoyable, not even the things we enjoy doing, and that's how life is.
You say you enjoy shopping.
I understand but life goes on.
You can't do the same things every day.
Live your life and try to do different things and you will see that doing different things is exciting and more fun.
You don't have to be bored with the same old things.
Because as I said doing what you like is good only if you do it when you like and how you like and remember if you have a long time to do something you enjoy it more.
I was really grateful when I received your letter which informed me that I have won first prize in your competition.
I would like to make this trip the first week or the last week of July because my school finishes at the end of June and I will have a month's break and after that.
I have to do a computing course which I have already applied for .
Could you possibly tell me, at Camp California will I stay in tents or log cabins? Personally I prefer to stay in log cabins because they are much more comfortable than tents.
I really enjoy swimming and playing tennis.
Unfortunately I am not good at either of them.
Maybe I will have time to do enough practice, as much as I always wanted to do.
I don't know where to start but I can say it was the best time I have ever had.
As I mentioned to you before, a friend of mine is a stage assistant and she needed help with that pop concert last month.
I told her if she needed help, I would be happy to help her.
Next day, when I went there, I met lots of people who were very famous and very friendly.
It took us almost a month to prepare for this concert.
You wouldn't believe how hard it was.
The stage was covered with all sorts of light and we made it look like a waterfall.
The waterfall was made from real rock so that was the worst bit because it was really heavy and we had to carry it, but at the end of the month when the concert started, it was all over.
I sang and danced all day.
I have lots of memories which I could never forget.
I wish you shared my happiness with me.
With regard to your letter, I am writing to give you the information you need to know regarding my stay of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am very excited and looking forward to the new experience I am going to have.
First of all I must tell you that I only have free time in July - on any day, any week - because I am still having my lessons at college and they will be finished at the end of June, and also in August I have a training course for my studies.
I would prefer to stay in tents because I love the atmosphere of camping, but I wouldn't mind staying in log cabins.
For the two activities I can choose, I would like to do swimming and Basketball.
I have always found these kinds of activity make me feel strong and I enjoy doing them.
I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing both up till now.
I was also in a basketball team in school for 3 years.
The aim of this report is to describe and assess which lessons and activities should be filmed for a short video.
It is based on information made available by students from each class at school.
Most students who were interviewed suggested having a speaking part in the lesson that is to be on film.
It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with their partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
It was felt to be a good memory to be reminded and to remind us to speak in a correct way.
This lesson will help us to be relaxed and have a laugh.
We also would like to have a history one.
Going out to visit the historical town every weekend seems to be the most enjoyable activity for students.
Spending time together out of the class is a nice experience.
Playing a sport after class is also fun.
The lessons and activities which most students suggested are very interesting and they do not seem to be boring for the students.
I learnt from your letter that I've won the first prize.
I .
I understand you want to know when I am available to set off and where I'd like to stay.
First of all I will be able to go to the U.S.A only in July because of my university.
I am studying Economics and I am very busy nowadays.
My exams will have finished at the end of June.
I will only be able to set off in July and also I will give my thesis to my teacher in August.
This holiday will help me to think about it and prepare it.
I'd prefer to stay in a log cabin because I need a proper place to stay and study in.
Basically, I don't like staying in a small tent.
When I get to the camp, I'd like to swim and climb.
I used to climb mountains and am good at climbing.
I am fond of swimming but unfortunately I am not a good swimmer.
I haven't written to you for ages.
I do apologise for this.
How are you? How is your new school and your parents? I hope we can catch up with each other's news.
Last month I helped the service crew at a pop concert.
It was unbelievable, and tiring as well.
I saw all the pop bands and singers.
I heard them talking backstage.
They signed my diary and had their photo taken with me.
Being a security guard was the hardest task.
Carrying big speakers from place to place was extremely tiring but we had loads of laughs.
Believe it or not, I put make-up on one famous singer's face.
I was just walking down by the dressing room and the manager asked if I could help them.
I couldn't believe my ears.
I was in her room helping her.
I especially liked that time.
I advise you to do something like that.
I'm going to help them again.
I am so pleased to know that I have won such an amazing prize in your competition.
I would like to answer the questions you have asked me.
Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because that is the month which I could most likely have off from work to go on holiday.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than a tent.
That is because, I do not want to seem fussy, but I like to have some luxuries when I am going on holiday and I think sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
Finally, I would like to choose swimming as my activity in the Camp.
I love swimming and also I should say that I am very good at this sport because I have been doing it for a long time.
Conversely, painting is an activity which I have never tried before, so I have not any skill in drawing but I would like to start doing that now when I have the chance.
So that is my second choice.
 I would like to know some information which could be useful on my holiday like: what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring anything else? If so, please let me know as soon as possible.
I am writing to tell you about my experience at the pop concert last month, where I was helping my friend Nick, who was the bouncer at the venue.
It was a charity concert to raise money for poor people in AFRICA.
My job was to .
Of course those places were reserved just for well-known people who wanted to help by attending the concert.
So I had to ask them for their identification and for their invitations.
After that, I had to take them to their respective seats.
At first, I was a bit scared, I mean, I was afraid of not being good enough to do well as an assistant; but finally everything went well.
I should say that it was the easiest and most interesting job that I have ever done.
I really enjoyed it and also I did not miss the opportunity to ask the artist to have his photo taken with me.
So, I hope to see you soon to show you all my photos.
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never ever forget, and that was the thing that I liked most about that experience.
I am writing to give you further information about me which you need for Camp California.
I am delighted that I have finally won first prize in your competition.
I would like to travel only in June because I will start working in July which means I will not be able to come there any later.
Moreover, I would rather stay in a tent than in a log cabin because I always stay in a tent when I am on holidays.
It is not comfortable but I still like it.
Concerning the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good at it because I have attended a relevant course for three months.
Because of my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity.
Is it true or not? Some people agree with it, some people don't.
If you don't work and you have plenty of time going shopping is really enjoyable, because there are big shopping centres in which you can find so many different things.
There are new products which you could not imagine could be so interesting.
Shopping is a good way to kill time and sometimes you do not realize how fast the time goes.
This happens because people are enjoying themselves a lot.
On the other hand there are some disadvantages.
For example if you are a working mother with three children, which means you are always in a hurry, going shopping is really unenjoyable.
You shop in a big supermarket because you know you will find everything there and you need 15 minutes to find the goods and 20 minutes to pay for them because of the big queue.
You need to buy essential items like food and you get tired because it is very crowded and you spend more time than you would like to.
In conclusion shopping is enjoyable but not when it is too busy.
Otherwise if you are in a good mood it will turn into a bad mood.
You should avoid the peak times.
Thank you very much for your letter which said I have won first prize in your competition.
I was really surprised to hear that.
I am afraid I can only make it in July, because I am taking exams this month.
Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University in August.
I have no time until Christmas.
So, I think the best time is July.
The accommodation I prefer is a tent.
I haven't tried it before.
I would like to know how interesting it is to live in tents.
If I can only choose two activities while I am at the Camp, I would like climbing and Basketball.
I started climbing when I was a child.
I love it very much.
About Basketball, I have been playing it for seven years.
I would like to play basketball with local people at the Camp to see how good they are, if I can.
1.
.
2.
Speaking: it makes you more confident when you talk with other people.
It lets you get more practice.
3.
Listening.
It is really helpful for improving your listening and understanding.
4.
Writing.
This class teaches you how to organise what you want to write.
Also, there are two activities that should be filmed.
1.
Students talk to each other when they are having a break.
It is important to practise your English after lessons.
2.
Teachers help students with their problems.
If you have a problem studying, try asking the teachers about which is the best way to study.
In Conclusion, the short video is only 60 minutes.
It must show the daily lives of the English students at the school.
It should include all those points lists above.
I'm really keen on sports, especially sailing.
I've been sailing since an early age and I manage the rigging and sail perfectly.
I'm also fond of tennis, I've just started my lessons and would like to continue playing during the summer.
So, I think I'll do sailing and tennis.
I'm not really sure about what kind of clothes to take.
Could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot.
I'm a shopaholic, but I have to admit shopping is not always enjoyable.
For instance, I spent my Spring Break with my friends in Italy.
We went there to buy our dresses for our boyfriends' graduation (besides other reasons).
They had invited us and we wanted them to see us looking stunningly beautiful.
While we were in Florence my wallet was stolen, probably by a gypsy.
I was so annoyed! I was in the Plaza Espagna in Florence without a penny! My friends lent me some money, but it wasn't more than 120 pounds.
I had to buy my dress, its accessories and also clothes and souvenirs! I couldn't really do much, so I used the money I had and bought an incredible pair of shoes and some souvenirs.
I felt really bad seeing my friends buy the latest fashion while the only thing I could do was tell them how great their clothes were and of course window-shop.
In your letter you mentioned that I could choose between sleeping in tents or a log cabin, and I would like to sleep in a log cabin please.
This is because last time I was in a tent, I found it really uncomfortable and when it rained in the night I couldn't get to sleep because of the sound of water hitting the tent.
Shopping can be very exciting and fun.
The feeling of buying new things is wonderful.
But it might not be the same every time.
We all go shopping, maybe not every day, but certainly at least once a week.
Shopping is very important because it's the only way to get things.
For example, food.
You will not be able to survive without food.
So buying necessary things is fine I think.
But buying things that you do not need or you have not planned to might make you feel good at the time, but days or weeks later when you realise you did not need to spend money on them, you might regret buying them.
For example you did not plan to buy any crisps, but they are at half price and you buy them without thinking.
But afterwards you never eat them and just bin them.
I think buying things needed and planned could be enjoyable but buying things you don't need or unplanned, might make you feel sad after some time.
First of all, we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition.
Thank you for choosing our ticket .
Is there a chance to stay in a log cabin.
I sometimes have trouble with backache when I can't sleep on a flat surface.
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf.
My wife Catrin is a local champion in swimming races.
I'm not so good as her, but I go once every week to her training session.
At golf, we are both total beginners.
We have no experience but we would like to learn this game.
We are looking forward to hearing from you soon.
You are interested in my last job! I really want to tell you all about my experience.
However, I'm happy that we have finished this hard work.
I worked in a team of seven people.
We were mainly working on all the lights at this great concert.
It sounds easy, just doing the lighting.
In addition, it was nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place.
Finally, we worked the whole night before the concert.
We had to adjust the laser extremely carefully to get it in the correct position.
We spent hours on this till it was good enough for the technical manager.
Moreover, the band was exhausted by this great laser show in the end.
For me this adventure was one of the best.
It shows that, when all members of a group work hard together, you can achieve a lot.
As you asked me some questions, here are the answers.
It would be very convenient if I could travel in July, because by that time I'll be on my school holidays.
If you agree I would like to have a tent for my accommodation, because I have never stayed in one and I wonder if it might be a great feeling and if in this way I will be in closer contact with the animals that live in the area.
It would be very pleasant if I could join your basketball team, since I used to play in my school's team and I think I'm pretty good at it.
Surfing would be another good option because I have never stepped on a surfboard and I think this is a beautiful sport.
I'd like to know about the kind of clothes I should take, if it's cold or hot at that time of the year and if I should bring any money.
I have butterflies in my stomach and I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
Some people usually spend more money than they have and end up broke, with a lot of bills to pay.
However, if you don't have those spending sprees very often, shopping can be a pleasant experience and a chance to spend some quality time with your family.
Have you ever spent more money than you should during a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations.
But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry.
It's normal to have spending sprees.
Everyone has had or will have one while shopping.
But don't be afraid.
Going to the shopping centre with your family can be a good experience.
It's a moment in which you can talk to your relatives and use this conversation to get to know more about yourselves.
If you are a good observer, it's a great chance to get to know what your son or daughter would like to have for their birthday or for any other special occasion.
In conclusion, if you go shopping reasonably, have a good time.
On the other hand, if you think that you'll get in the red, you'd better stay at home.
Thank you very much.
I am very pleased I have won first prize in the competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Accommodation, I prefer tents to log cabins.
Tents are very easy to carry and can go everywhere.
What's more, in my opinion they are very romantic.
I am good at singing and photography.
I can sing most kinds of songs, such as pop music, folk.
I like taking photographs, .
There are all kinds of photos, for example, of the beach, sea, trees and so on.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and should be filmed for a short video.
In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class.
The majority of them said it's a good idea to do something about Maths and English study skills.
Sixty percent recommended that the activity which should be filmed.
Ten of them said we should film computing.
Two thirds said we should film .
Although Maths is very boring, it is very important nowadays.
English is the most popular language in the world.
What's more, more and more people are starting to learn English.
can help us remember new words.
Playing football is good for your health.
It is recommended that something should be filmed about Maths, English study skills, and playing football.
I am very surprised to have received your letter in which you explained to me that I have won a prize in your competition.
After that, I would like to say Thanks, I have never won any prizes at all.
Now, I will answer your questions.
In reference to the date of travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at University and I only have July to take my holidays.
As you state in your letter I have to choose the type of accommodation.
I would prefer to stay in a tent because since I was a child I have been using this type of accommodation.
I used to go camping.
About camp activities, I would prefer to do basketball and photography.
I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby.
I have recently bought a new camera.
I am writing to you to tell you about my experience at a pop concert.
It began when our mutual friend Martha offered me the chance to help organise the concert.
Obviously I accepted.
Now I can tell you that it was an amazing challenge for me because I had never done anything like that.
My duties as a staff member were various.
The first day I had to pick the bands up from the airport, and for this I hired a van.
The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the staff and also every day I was backstage supporting the catering staff.
I am particularly pleased to have known the most popular pop stars in the world.
.
I would like to travel only in July because I will have some holiday at that time.
.
I prefer to stay in log cabins rather than in tents, because log cabins have , that I need to stay for a few days.
.
I can play basketball well, because I used to play basketball, when I went to the club every Saturday.
Now I am planning to be a good photographer.
I will use some photographs to put on a website that belongs to a magazine, which .
2 Most students are very shy when the teachers ask them if they have any doubts about .
The students at school shoudn't be shy, because .
3 When you are ready to shop, sometimes you know beforehand what is your priority , because probably you need one thing rather than another.
But the best thing that we do, when we go shopping is spend time having lunch at a snack bar, watching movies and playing computer games.
Last month, I worked as a roadie at a Rolling Stones pop concert.
I was responsible for the sound .
Now, I have some experience in producing live DCs of famous bands, I would like to do it.
I hope to be a producer of shows, as soon as possible.
I was very happy to learn that I have won the first prize in your competition and it will be a good opportunity for me to go to the U.S.A.
I have chosen photography and climbing as my activities.
I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in it.
I have a medium level of proficiency in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains.
I like shopping.
Some people when they are tired relax by sleeping, reading a book or watching television, but not me.
Walking along the crowded streets of my city is my way of relaxing.
I have been working in a shop for a long time and I have noticed that I am not the only one .
There are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
However, it is true that shopping is not always enjoyable, for example before Christmas or during some special sales.
In these periods of the year, the supermarkets and the shops are full of stressed adults and tired children in a hot and noisy place.
I am writing in reply to your letter, in order to answer your questions.
Second, I would rather stay in a log cabin, because I tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be inappropriate for me.
I would prefer golf and surfing.
I haven't played golf for a long time, so it will be pleasant to do so.
About surfing, I am an amateur at it.
I have been surfing for five years and I have competed in two championships.
Finally, I would like to ask you what kind of clothes would you recommend I take.
I have never been to California, so I have no idea about the weather there.
Also, I would like to know if I will need any money there.
It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the singer fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark.
The fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened.
Then, a security guard started calling for help.
I happened to be near him, so I went to help him.
He asked me to help Bono, the singer, get up and to get him some water.
I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him.
There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger.
About an hour later, he recovered and the show began.
I have received your exciting letter, informing me that I have won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
I will answer your questions in this letter, beginning with the best time for my visit.
Because of my studies I will not be free to travel until July and schools start again in August so I hope July will be fine.
I much prefer sleeping in tents.
It seems more sociable and really .
Choosing only two activities from such a variety of interesting ones was quite hard, but I decided to pick the two I've never tried, climbing and surfing.
Forgive me for the long time I left you without any news.
I wrote to you last time that I was going to lend a hand with the installation and preparation of "Garbage's" concert and you asked me to tell you how it was.
So one week before the concert I went to "L'Arena" to meet the other worker and receive the instructions.
I've had the honour of helping their sound engineer and .
We really started to the morning before the show.
It was exciting looking at all three men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
And the next morning I was there again to help them put away their stuff.
I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received last week, and in fact I am very surprised and pleased with the prize.
First of all I would like to travel in July because it is my only free month, since I am student and I am very busy all year.
Secondly, regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I used to use a tent on holiday and I haven't .
In addition, I work every summer as a at the leisure centre in my town.
Apart from this, photography is one of my favourite hobbies and I usually spend nearly all my spare time doing it and of course I have some diplomas as well.
Lastly I would like to ask you some questions.
 I would like to have further information about what kind of clothes I need for that area.
I don't know if I have to bring only light clothes or both light and heavy clothes.
 I would like to request some information about accommodation and if you could specify what this trip includes, since I need to know how much money I have to take.
Hello, it's been ages since we were in touch.
I'm sorry I haven't written to you for such a long time but I was very busy last month, with this job.
I have to tell you that this experience was wonderful and in fact I enjoyed it a lot and of course I got to know a lot of people there.
At first I was a little unsure about whether I was able to do this job, because they needed people with some skills and experience.
But later I decided to call them and ask them for further information about this job.
After an interview I was chosen for the job.
I couldn't believe it.
I feel that this was a good opportunity for me, not only for my professional but also for my personal life.
Moreover I a lot of aspects of my speciality, which for me was the most important .
 I had to help the teams with the outlights and, of course, it was my first professional experience: in the end I felt like one of them, because they were so kind to me, and I could help a lot and I learnt a lot with this project.
Furthermore, I found the time went quickly and they offered me a new project for the summer.
I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA.
The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've already planned the rest of my summer holidays.
In June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there.
The accommodation at the camp that is most suitable for me is in log cabins.
I prefer that kind of accommodation because I can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but I can't have it in a tent.
I've also chosen two activities, swimming and sailing.
These are my favourite because they have a lot to do with water, but I like them more than surfing.
Finally I would like to ask you how much money is needed and what kind of clothes are the best for this camp.
I agree with this statement especially when we talk about small shops in the centre of a big town.
These shops are usually very crowded and you have to wait for a very long time to buy one kilogram of carrots for example.
In such shops there is usually one or one or two sales assistants, which is not enough when a shop is full of people.
That's a place where you lose too much time and health.
Shopping is more enjoyable if you go to a big supermarket, because there are smaller crowds and more sales assistants work there.
These days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.
I am replying to your letter about the first prize in the competition that I won and there are a number of things I would like to make clear.
You asked me in your last letter when I would like to travel.
I think the best time is the first two weeks of July, because I will be free then.
I cannot travel earlier because I will take an examination and I have to study for it.
In addition, I would prefer to have a log cabin, because I am not used to sleeping in a tent, so it would be very difficult for me at the beginning.
You state in your last letter that I will have the chance to do two activities.
I would prefer basketball and swimming.
When I was younger I was in a local basketball team and we became local champions, so I am good at basketball and have a lot of experience.
I am also good at swimming.
Last year I entered a swimming championship and won the silver medal.
As you know, I helped out at a pop concert last month, and I must say it was fantastic.
Let's start from the beginning.
First of all, I had to prepare the clothes of the pop stars.
I had to iron them, and put them in order, so that the pop stars, who sang at the concert, would look impressive and handsome.
The most exciting things happened later.
I saw all the pop stars, talked with them and realized that they are very nice and always helpful.
I had a lot of things to do during the concert.
I had to look after the .
That was very demanding but fortunately I had help from another person.
I must say that being at a concert is very nice.
But helping at a concert is much nicer.
At the end I realized that all you need is co-operation and you mustn't think selfishly.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you for your letter.
I am very glad I won the competition.
This trip will, undoubtedly, be a wonderful experience.
As far as the travel dates are concerned, the only period available would be in July as I am fully booked for the rest of the summer.
I really didn't expect to win the trip.
I would therefore be very grateful if you could book the tickets for then.
Concerning the accommodation options you have offered me, please make sure I am sleeping in a tent, as I have never experienced open-air camping before.
I think it would be nice to try it at least once.
Concerning the proposed activities, please, put me down for Singing and Painting.
The only problem would be that my drawing is pretty bad.
Concerning Singing activities, I think I'm quite good as I have been in my school's choir for 3 years.
As you asked me, I am writing to you about my experience at the pop concert.
But, as I said, the whole thing was fun.
You must show a great sense of responsibility.
But, Kim, can you see another way to meet the "New Bentley" for free, talk to them and even get paid? That was my best day ever, the one when I shared a meal with Paul McPartney.
I'm sure you are jealous now.
Don't worry they still organise these "youth work" programmes.
Now I am studying and I'll continue my studies until the end of June.
Then I'll have a holiday which will finish in August.
That's why I'd like to travel only in July.
I prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it's more comfortable.
They are warmer and drier and I'm afraid of insects and spiders.
It's really great that you can suggest how to spend the rest of the time, because I enjoy swimming and it doesn't matter where - in the lake or swimming pool.
I think it's a very useful and helpful thing for my health, especially when I do it with pleasure.
The second of my favourite sports is tennis.
I've played tennis for ten years.
I'm a professional and I have to be good at it, time.
How are you? I'm fine.
Soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward to that but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot.
Now I want to tell you about a pop concert.
As you already know I helped my father to organize this concert.
I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing.
Sometimes I gave some advice about suits and dresses.
Often we saw rehearsals and if something didn't appeal to us we tried to correct it.
The most enjoyable thing was to dress people.
We have a good and rich sponsor.
That's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that piece of clothing which we thought was most suitable for their style.
We always explained things to them and in the end they agreed with us.
These days were so busy.
But when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we .
You should try it and see.
I'll be waiting for your answer.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I am very happy to be the winner of the competition and I am looking forward to coming to Camp California.
I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have.
In August, , I will start a new job and I will not be able to leave Rome for a long time.
I am also pleased to have the chance to do some activities and I would like to choose something I am not able to do .
So, I have decided to choose photography and surfing because I am an absolute beginner at both of them.
Please let me know what the climate is like at the camp, so that I can take with me the right kind of clothes.
It would also be useful for me to know if there will be any extra expenses, in order to take enough money for two weeks.
Being a woman, I naturally love shopping.
It is a really great pleasure going in and out of different shops, trying on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally going back home with dozens of bags in your hands.
However, there are a few times when you cannot enjoy shopping.
The first one is the Christmas period.
Shops are incredibly crowded.
You cannot try on a dress and decide to buy it, or not in peace, because outside there is a queue of people waiting for their turn.
In many cases, you do not even find the things you want, because the shops run out of products very quickly.
Moreover, during this period, prices are usually much higher than in the other months.
Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable is when you go shopping with a man.
For the majority of men, in fact, shopping is the most boring activity in the world.
A man will try to prevent you from trying more than one dress on and will refuse to stay in the same shop for more than five minutes.
I'm writing to tell you that I am happy to accept this prize and to give you some further information that you need from me.
If it's possible I would like to travel in July because of my job.
I can't leave it until that month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of year.
As I see I have the chance to choose the accommodation I prefer, I would like to stay in a tent because I used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem I could be very comfortable in a log cabin too.
The large list of interesting activities that you offer is incredible.
It's difficult just to choose two but if I have the chance I would like to do sailing and photography.
I have never tried either of them before and as a result I can't be good at them but I've always wanted to sail because I love the sea and now I have the opportunity.
I also think that it would be great to learn about photography because it will give me the chance to go sightseeing and find wonderful places to take pictures.
If you don't mind I would like to know what kind of clothes are appropriate for the camp and for the Californian weather.
And also will I have to bring any money? I know that all the expenses are paid but it could be necessary for other things.
I look forward to hearing from you.
In my opinion a lot of people believe that it's great fun to go shopping and it's a great way to spend Saturday afternoons and that's true, but in my opinion going shopping can be stressful and disgusting.
First of all, we usually go to the shops at the same time as the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are full and it's impossible .
And after all of this it's important when you're going shopping to have a large amount of money or you will end up stressed, disgusted, and depressed.
Last but not least let me give you some advice, try not to go with that friend of yours who is crazy about clothes and shoes because she wants you to be like her and that would be awful.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I just received it yesterday.
I am very excited.
I would like to go to California in the U.S.A.
in July.
It is the only month that I can have my holiday this year and it will be nice in the summertime.
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin.
It would be nicer and safer for me than the tents.
The activities I would like to choose are swimming and sailing.
It could be fun for me because I like swimming, and sailing could be exciting too.
Lastly, I would like to know about the money and clothes.
How about the weather in California in July? Is it hot or raining? And can I my clothes, or can we buy some clothes there? Do they accept credit cards or only cash? I don't want to take money with me.
I would be grateful if you could send me the full details.
Many thanks.
In the following paragraphs I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of shopping.
In a supermarket, shop or department store they have many things.
We could buy almost all we need in one store.
It is very convenient.
On the other hand, shopping is not always easy.
Sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
We have seen then that shopping is very important for our life.
Most people enjoy shopping because it is more convenient today but if you found a busy place for shopping or it was not as good as you expected, it would not be enjoyable for you.
I've just finished reading the letter from you about winning first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
You asked me for some further information.
I would like to travel in July only because I'll be free for the whole month.
So any date in July.
I'd like to stay at Camp California in tents, because I like to sleep in a tent when I go camping.
Also I would like to choose the two activities from the list that you have given me.
I would like to choose Swimming and Photography.
I'm good at swimming.
I used to swim for the school team.
But I have never done photography before.
I love to take photos but never have a chance to do so.
But I have a chance to choose.
Well, it was quite fun while I was helping them to do the stuff before the concert started.
I had to get everything that they needed up the stairs.
It was so tiring.
Then after that I had to help them carry all the clothes for the singer to wear from the bus down into the staff room.
I saw Westlife too.
You know they are so cute.
Then I could take a rest for about 30 mins.
After that I had to go into the staff room again because they wanted me to go and buy some drink for the singer.
After I came back I had to help them clean all the make-up stuff.
The concert began...
That meant I could take a rest until the concert finished.
After the concert had finished I had to help them again to clean all the stuff, I had to carry everything that I could carry back to the bus.
We were so tired but it was good fun.
I think this experience was quite interesting.
If somebody asked me to go and help again I would like to go for sure.
Thank you for your lovely letter.
I was really surprised to hear I had won your competition.
It will be a pleasure to give you all the information which you need.
I would like to book my tickets for the beginning of July.
The 3rd of July will suit me.
As far as I know accommodation at Camp California is in tents or log cabins.
I prefer log cabins.
It's more convenient for me.
I am very glad I can choose two activities while I am at the Camp.
I am keen on basketball.
I played in my country for 7 years.
I am a good defender.
I would like to choose surfing as my second activity.
I've never done it before.
I'd like to get some lessons if it's possible.
I've seen how people do it but I've never tried it myself.
We can't say that it is always enjoyable or it is not.
Every new day is not the same.
But...
I think that good shopping depends on us.
If we decide to buy something special and we have enough money for it we have to go and buy it.
Probably, maybe not.
Sometimes we have to deal with unsatisfactory service or, for example, can you imagine meeting the wrong people on the way to the shop or someone telling you bad news.
Or perhaps the quality of your new thing is not so good as you expected.
The situations are various.
Maybe you will spend all your money on a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to a night-club but you will be short of money.
Some people will do crazy things in a situation like this.
They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party.
But I want to wish you some enjoyable shopping .
I am writing to you because I am very glad about my first place in the competition.
I am going to tell you about the things that you ask me about in your letter.
I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time to go to the camp and it is summer.
Accommodation at camp, I would like to choose cabins because I think I would be protected from the animals and the cold.
Furthermore, for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I have been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college as the captain.
I'm writing to you to tell you about my experience helping at a pop concert.
Well first let me tell you that my job was helping the artists if they needed something, for example giving them water or snacks.
It wasn't very exciting work but you could meet a lot of pop Artists, which was the good thing about it because they gave away their T-shirts, also I could chat with them for a few minutes.
Another good thing was that all the people wanted to be in your place and they were very jealous of me.
Anyway, this was my experience working at the concert.
If you have an opportunity to help at any concert you should help because you have a lot of fun as well, OK.
I am writing to you, in reply to the letter I have recently received, to inform you about some details that I am concerned about.
First of all I want you to know that I would prefer to travel in July due to the exam I will be taking in June and, afterwards, I will start my university studies in September which means there are lots of things to be sorted out.
Secondly, I prefer staying in log cabins because it is easier for me to keep my personal belongings clean and tidy, apart from the fact that I am terribly afraid of insects such as spiders and ants.
In your letter you presented the possibility of choosing two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join in with basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them because I played basketball in my secondary school as captain of the team and due to my long training sessions lifting weights.
Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien on their territory.
There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.
All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay.
If this wasn't enough your strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when, despite having been robbed, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry, you finally buy something you really like with your credit card and, after having walked a few blocks, you see the same item at half the price in another shop.
I'm the winner of the first prize in your competition and I'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you.
Your first question was about when I'd like to travel.
Well, it's only possible in July because of the university's holiday (during the rest of the year I'm attending classes).
If I can choose my accommodation I would prefer a log cabin, because when I've been on campsites before, it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation.
It's really difficult to choose two activities from that list.
Every one is very interesting.
Anyway, I think basketball could be the right choice because it's the sport that I've been playing since I was a child, and photography because it's my hobby in my free time.
I really enjoy it and I can say I'm good at it.
I suppose that's everything that you need from me.
If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask me.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you, again.
I think shopping is a really topical subject.
I can say that nowadays it is very quickly in our society, like a kind of sport or hobby, as a way to waste or spend our free time.
And it's creating a lot of addicted people, called "shopaholics".
Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable.
You can spend hours and hours shopping and not find what you are looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable for you.
Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms, where you wait standing up for your turn.
After that, there is the unfriendly and sometimes impolite shop assistant who gets on your nerves .
But never mind! The worst is when you get home in the evening and find a chair to sit in because your feet are killing you and you realize you have spent all your money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions.
First of all I would like to travel in July because I will have finished my exams by the end of June.
I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month.
Secondly I would prefer to stay in a log cabin.
When I was a child I was afraid of all these little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
I also think that the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent.
Basketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen.
I have played basketball since I was twelve years old and I have been a member of the school basketball team for four years.
In swimming I won the first prize in a local competition.
Finally I would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the money we will need.
As you already know, last month I was helping at a pop concert.
It was a very exciting experience and I really enjoyed myself very much.
I didn't have to do anything very difficult.
I was only responsible for .
But if anyone asked for some help I was always there.
I received your letter about the two weeks I won at camp California in the U.S.A.
I would like to travel in July because I will have holidays in that month.
About the accommodation at camp, I prefer a tent because I love to sleep in tents.
It is more interesting than sleeping in log cabins.
I would like to do climbing and sailing while I'm at the camp.
I can climb very well.
I used to climb ten years ago in my country.
I'm worried about what kind of clothes I will need in the camp? And how much money I have to bring for the trip? Could you answer my questions please as soon as you can, because I'm nervous, and I need your answer soon, and I will have a talk with my parents about the camp.
I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable.
Nowadays, people are always buying things when maybe they don't need these things, but only buy them because they are in fashion.
In the first place, when people think only about going shopping they forget other things: playing with their children, talking with their parents, friends.
On the other hand, when people go shopping they spend a lot of money.
I my view, it is more enjoyable to do other things than to go shopping because, maybe, "you waste your money".
I'm happy to answer your questions.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because my boss won't let me take time off in August.
Secondly, I would like to stay in a tent because I like camping a lot and I do it whenever I can.
Regarding the activities, I choose swimming and tennis.
I'm a good swimmer and I would like to do it in the Californian sea.
I don't think I'll have the chance to do it again in the future.
, I'm an absolute beginner at playing tennis and I'm not fit enough for running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time.
I can't wait to start this adventure.
I'm a woman and they say that shopping is women's favourite activity.
But I have a particular problem.
I'm not slim and I'm a little ashamed of my body.
That's why shopping is not an easy thing to do.
In fact I can't buy whatever I like and I can't follow fashions like the other women do.
When I go shopping I always have to ask for the extra-large size and it's harder to find it.
I see a lot of pretty things but I have to abandon the idea of wearing them just because I think that they won't look so pretty on me.
And if this is a problem for me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) would feel.
Often they must go to special shops to buy their clothes.
It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty.
Just think about commercials.
They're full of perfect people.
The sort of people you will never find in real life.
Here is the information which you asked me for.
I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month that I will be able to take days off.
Also my kids have school holidays during this month therefore I hope to travel in mid July.
I'd prefer to say in log cabins, because our family had some bad experiences with using tents.
Whenever we used a tent, we had bugs or the rain dropped inside the tent.
It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography.
Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it.
But Golf is an absolutely new trial.
I can imagine myself playing Golf on those beautiful Californian golf-courses.
Even though I'm poorly skilled.
 I wonder what else I have to pack to go there.
Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money with me.
How are you? I hope you are fine.
I'm fine too but I'm quite busy finding another part time job after the one, which was the one supporting the concert.
First when I got there I realised that I was the only woman and I had to work in the box-office.
It was quite terrible when I had to make people leave, because all tickets were sold out.
It was a pity that I had no chance to learn how the sound system works, which I was mostly interested in.
But it was terrific enough to hear the band performing and to see the audience's reactions, meanwhile the backstage couldn't even enjoy that fantastic atmosphere.
What I really liked was that every single person had to be responsible for his role, till we left the stadium.
And that made the concert absolutely perfect.
I hope this is enough to express my feeling and I hope someday we can share such things together.
Firstly, I would like to travel to Camp California on Monday, 6th July, because my school's holiday will begin at the end of June.
Otherwise I will not be able to join that camp.
Secondly, could you make an arrangement for me to stay in a log cabin, because it seems that living in log cabins is more exciting than in tents.
Also I would prefer to go swimming and surfing, because I used to be an assistant in a Korean national pool, so I am good at swimming.
However, I have never tried surfing.
That is why I would like to do that.
Finally, could you tell me if I have to bring some clothes, towels and extra money? I would appreciate it if you supplied some towels, if possible.
It took place in the Korea national center which is the biggest building in Korea.
There were a lot of people, I guess over 50,000, who wanted to see famous singers and listen to their songs.
I helped to guide foreigners who would like to participate in that.
You know, I have studied English for two years in England.
That's why I could attend that concert as a volunteer, because they needed people who could speak English very well.
What I really enjoyed was meeting famous World singers such as Madona, Bon Jovi, Ena and so on.
I got Madona's autograph! Can you believe it? I'll show you that and some pictures.
Thank you for your letter.
I was so happy to receive such good news that I couldn't believe it.
To answer your first question, I would like to travel in July if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at that time of the year.
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, which is going to be more fun, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question.
I can see on the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quite good(I finished 5th in the English Junior Golf Tournament in 1999), and basketball, because I would like to rediscover this sport I only used to play at school.
Thank you for all the information you can give me.
I look forward to hearing from you.
First, we should film some lessons because everybody knows (or remembers if they are grown-ups) that this is the activity that takes up most of a student's time at school.
Just after, to make a contrast, we may film the break, because it's the other part of a school day! It's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and there are no teachers.
It could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
To come back to the central subject, I suggest that we film the sports lesson .
Doing that will allow the spectator to see how the students behave when they are all together and in small groups.
Finally we should film the lunch, which is also a moment for the students, and for the teachers, to relax.
We mustn't forget to film the staff room because if a school is made of students, it's also made of teachers.
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
This August I will start a new job so the only possible month for me to join the camp is July.
I hope this will cause no problems.
I am glad that you offer accommodation not only in tents but also in log cabins.
Because I am a light sleeper and have problems with my back I prefer to sleep in a log cabin with a comfortable bed.
Although it was not easy to choose two activities from your list I decided to do singing and surfing.
It is difficult to say how well I can sing but I really like it and I think I am not too bad.
I have never tried surfing in my life but I am a very good snowboarder and this could be an advantage.
I hope I have given you all the information you need.
There is something I would like to know from you.
Last Saturday evening I had a wonderful time.
The motorbike club in our town organized a pop concert.
A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk.
I did not hesitate one moment.
The only thing I had to do was to solve the different problems of the audience and just be there if they had any questions.
Some people came from Germany, some from Austria and some came from England or the U.S.A.
It was very nice that I earned a lot of money for doing something I like very much but the most important thing for me was meeting people, having fun and using the English language.
I will never forget this evening.
First I want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation.
I have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
Another question was about the accommodation.
I have to tell you that I'd prefer a tent.
For me tents are a kind of back-to-basic living and I like this very much.
In my opinion people should become more familiar with the rules of nature.
I was very glad to read that it is possible to do activities at Camp California.
I've chosen singing and swimming.
Singing is one of my favourite activities and I know that I do it very well.
I'm also used to singing in front of a large number of people because I have done it several times.
I'm also good at swimming but I do not do it professionally.
There are two further questions which I have to ask you.
First, how much money do I have to take with me? And what clothes should I take? I'd be very happy if you could give me a call and answer these questions.
Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe.
Last month I received a letter which told me that I'd won a competition.
I was so happy and surprised that first I could not really believe it.
But it was true.
My prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at their concert.
The pop group which was going to play is called "Metallica" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to).
But now to the concert itself.
It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg.
It started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am.
First I had to help with the catering, which lasted until 2 pm.
After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal.
The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal.
I was so excited that I was not able to eat anything either.
At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guided tour for the journalists.
I had to show them the way to the interviewing room.
It was a bit boring but more or less okay.
At 7 p.m.
the first group started.
They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I realised that they were very nice.
At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they gave a great performance.
When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like "Did you like the performance?" or "What do you think about the first group?" Questions like you and I usually ask each other.
You know what I mean.
They were not conceited or anything like that.
They were like other people and I have to admit that I like them very much.
This was one of the best and most exciting days of my life.
First of all, I am available to travel in July from 1st to 20th because my university will be closed during that month.
Thirdly, I am very interested in swimming and also climbing.
I took up climbing five years ago and I am very keen on it.
I am very good at swimming as well because I practise this sport every week in my city.
Firstly, you have to queue for a long time to get a free changing room and waste time putting on some clothes when in the end they are not the right size.
Secondly, it is easy to spend a lot of money in a few minutes and you can soon regret buying all those clothes which you don't really need.
Thirdly, some clothes can have some stains on and you haven't noticed this before buying them, so you have to go back to the shop.
However, it is not easy to get a refund or to change them.
In my opinion, shopping gives me a lot of satisfaction especially when I am depressed.
Nevertheless it could be very dangerous for my wallet.
Firstly, I will be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August.
Secondly, regarding the accommodation, I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent when I was staying in a local scout camp in my country.
Thirdly, I have chosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favourite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them.
Finally, I would like to ask you whether I have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
I look forward to receiving the details regarding the trip soon and to joining your camp in July.
I do agree with this statement.
One of the most unforgettable habits of city life is going out shopping.
I used to hang around famous clothes shops looking at the new new-arrivals clothes section.
It is not only good fun to see the new fashions and things but it also decreases the amount of money in my pocket.
Sometimes shopping doesn't do anything for you but only wastes all your free time.
A group of girls can stay in a shopping centre forever.
It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexes nowadays are more attractive and combine every facility inside.
From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy.
Keeping a balance between daily life and shopping life may be more enjoyable rather than always walking in an air-conditioned shopping complex.
Thank you for your letter and I am very pleased that I won the first prize in your competition.
However, I am writing to you to ask for more details.
Firstly, I would like to go to California in June if this is possible because I will have finished my course in Merton college at the end of June.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than staying in a log cabin in order to have an experience which I haven't had before.
I am very keen on swimming and playing tennis so I have had a part-time job in a sports centre in the evenings.
I also have qualifications to teach them.
In addition to all this, I would appreciate it if you could let me have more details about clothes and how much I shall be paid for the trip.
The aim of this report is to describe our English classes in Merton College and suggest what we should film for making a short video.
It is suggested that speaking classes should be filmed.
The reason why is that more students tend to attend.
Another reason is that it will be more useful for foreign students who want to speak English.
The number of foreign students has recently been increasing.
It is also thought that school trips are to be filmed because there are a wide range of interesting places available.
It is believed to be one of the most popular activities in Merton College.
To sum up, it is recommended that speaking classes and school trips should be filmed.
First of all I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to travel.
You asked me some questions about the day that suits me the best to depart, the accommodation I would like to have and so on.
Travelling in July, I have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and I wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
I also would prefer to sleep in tents, which are more comfortable, and, because I have been doing lots of camping, I am quite used to this kind of accommodation.
The activities I have chosen both represent a passion for me.
Painting and swimming are my ways to have a good time, especially on holiday.
Although it is not always enjoyable, people are shopping more and more.
It is very fashionable .
They do not always buy lots of things, but I think most of them do.
Enjoying shopping isn't a reason for doing it.
I think people either go shopping to relax because they may have lots of problems or to meet other people, to feel they belong to a group of human beings.
You can guess how enjoyable a surprise receiving your letter was for me.
I am glad to send you the information required.
First of all, I must state that I can only leave during the month of July owing to a job I got for August.
After considering your accommodation offers, I'd rather stay in a log cabin if possible.
I hope you have no doubt about my taste for camping, however, I admit I will appreciate a bit of comfort .
Moreover, I must admit that the activities offered are really attractive so it's hard to make up my mind.
On the one hand, I own a camera that I often use during my leisure time.
Even if the photographs taken are modest work, I am really interested in this activity.
Then, as low as my level of proficiency at basketball is, I have enjoyed playing this sport for fun for a long time.
So it will be pleasant for me to do this activity.
Your letter indicates that the prize covers some costs .
Nevertheless I would like you to detail what I need for this trip.
What is obvious about our daily life at school is that it is hard to sum up all the different aspects it includes.
Therefore, the film will manage to be a success if it doesn't forget the main things that make our life.
To my mind, the class attending a lesson must be shown first.
It addresses the reason for our presence here and it is a ; .
A philosophy lesson seems quite appropriate in that the pupils take part in it.
Next, students during the break in the yard should be filmed.
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how they are as young people.
Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video.
Furthermore two moments could have a role.
First of all, the arrival of every student, .
Then, the opposite situation, that is to say the portrayal of this crowd disappearing at the end of the day can provide a comparison.
I have happily received your reply and I want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me.
Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only month of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks.
I would like a log cabin because I think you should provide me with good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity or entertainment.
I would like to play basketball and tennis .
I am a regular basketball player.
Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good at it.
As to tennis I'm the best player in my whole school and, once, I got into the top 10 of my country's tennis players.
I would like to ask you what type of clothes I should bring? How much money should I bring? Would $200 be enough? Well that's all for now and I hope to hear from you soon.
How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here.
You should have been here, it was amazing.
The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage.
We started by putting up the lights.
We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them.
Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up onto the stage and, believe me, that was the hardest bit of all.
They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus.
After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
I'll never wash my hand again.
Well that's all the time I've got for you now.
Hope to hear from you soon.
I'm writing to you in response to your letter.
I was delighted to know that I won the first prize.
With reference to the date, I can only go in July, as I'm going off on holiday in August, and I start university in September.
The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities.
The ones I'm most keen on are tennis, at which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and painting, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax and forget about problems.
I think I'm not bad at painting either; at least everyone in my family likes my work, including myself.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Basically my work was carrying the instruments, the speakers and the lights from the vans to the stage, which is not easy work because, as you can imagine, it's not exactly light stuff.
Anyway, I had a lot of fun working for them.
I hope they call me soon.
I'd be the happiest girl in the world if I could see them again...
I'd better stop now.
I hope you write again soon.
I am very happy to win this prize and I am going to give you some information that you need from me to ensure that I have a good time at Camp California.
I would like to go only in July because I have had my holidays booked for that month since last January.
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore I need a comfortable place to sleep.
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp.
I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago.
I also chose painting because I have never done it before.
I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a relaxing activity.
Yours faithfully.
How many times have we heard people complaining about shopping? Sometimes, they are happy to go shopping, but why? shopping can be enjoyable but that is not always the case.
Shopping is enjoyable when you want to give something to someone.
you try to get a present to make the recipient happy.
Shopping is also good when you know what you want.
For example if you want a new track suit you know that you have to go to a sports shop but if you don't know what you want you are going to waste your time in the shops.
On the other hand, shopping can be unenjoyable.
Shopping is boring if you go with people who are too fussy.
That is to say, they are never happy with what they get or see.
They always find a problem.
Shopping is not enjoyable with people who just look around the shops.
It is stupid.
They do not have any goal.
They waste their time.
To conclude, I agree that shopping is not always enjoyable.
Even if I like to go shopping with some people and to some kinds of shops I will kill myself if I waste my time.
To begin with, I would like to travel in July.
This is the only possible time for me, as the school holiday starts on the 29th of June.
And from August on I planned to do some part-time job in order to earn some pocket money.
Referring to the possibilities of accommodation, I'd prefer log cabins to tents.
Firstly, log cabins are more comfortable than tents.
Secondly, I do not like tents.
Last but not least, I always have backache after sleeping in a tent for a couple of days.
As I have been asked to choose two activities I would like to do during my stay at the camp, I chose Golf and singing.
I have never played Golf actually, but I would love to try something new.
As for singing, I am very keen on singing as I take lessons in it.
I just love singing.
I would like to know whether there are some facilities for washing Clothes.
Especially in summer, clothes get dirty very easily.
Lastly, does the prize include pocket money? If not, I will have to bring some with me.
Is there a possibility of exchanging different currencies to US dollars? I ask you to include the answer in your reply.
When you think of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accessories etc.
and buying them.
It sounds nice and shopping is great fun - or it should be.
Nowadays shopping can be very stressful.
It all starts with the search for an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends.
Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded.
You cannot make a step without "touching" others.
It gets enormously unbearable on hot summer days, when the temperature increases.
In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring.
But the worst moment comes if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out.
I'm excited to be going on holiday there and, thanks to you, I will realize a dream .
Dear Kim, I want to tell you about a good experience I had last month.
I enjoyed helping at a pop concert and it was fabulous.
At first, I helped them to carry the equipment and we fixed everything in the correct order.
There were so many pieces that we spent a whole day preparing the stage.
At the end, we had a beer and we talked together.
I was astonished to see how friendly and funny they were and we became good friends.
During the show, I was behind them and I could see the spectators shouting and jumping .
It was unbelievable to think that I'd worked with stars and that they were my friends.
It is difficult to explain what I particularly liked about my experience because and I'd never thought that I could get on so well with a group of people whom I'd known only for a few days.
If possible, I would like to introduce you to them.
They are very nice guys.
With reference to your letter of the 13th of June I would like to thank you for the prize your organisation is offering me.
Since I am a student I have to follow the vacation programme of my school, which means that I would only be able to travel during the month of July.
I would be grateful if you could book a tent for me at Camp California because I am a nature lover and the idea of sleeping outdoors really makes me happy.
Concerning the activities, tennis is my favourite sport and I am very keen on it.
For the second activity I would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and I think it is worthwhile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners' group.
I would like to know if you would be kind enough to send me some information on weather conditions for that month, the kind of currency I should take with me as well as the vaccination requirements.
Benoni's school is a recognised school for tourism located in the heart of Brussels, Belgium.
It offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computing, make-up, languages, geography, to culture and civilization.
Students start their day at the Gym, where they learn the importance of being fit, that is why I suggest filming this activity.
Once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life.
Depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study languages which I personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way.
Students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
Another important lesson to film is "culture and civilization," so people will know that the waitresses trained at this school are not simply, as the French say, "pot-au-fleurs", beautiful faces , but also well-read people.
Last but not least is the class called "know-how", which shows students how to cope with unexpected problems even if they are stressed.
I would also choose an outdoor lesson, "training".
The school works together with known companies in the industry ,the as Mariot hotel, Air France, Princess cruise, among others, in order to provide students with high-quality training.
I have recently received your letter informing me that I have won a prize at Camp California.
Enclosing the information you asked for, there are some points I want to point out.
First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of June so I can only travel in July.
I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than a log cabin.
Since I was a child, I have been interested in camping and sleeping in tents.
If I can participate in swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful.
I have been swimming for a club for 8 years and enjoy it a lot.
I am afraid I am not good at photography but I want to improve .
I need some more information about camp life and also I would like to know what I need to take with me.
For example, how much pocket money will be enough and what kind of clothes I should wear.
I hope to receive your reply soon.
I am really looking forward to going to this camp.
Subject: Suggestions about lessons and activities which should be filmed.
It is one of the most popular subjects in the school.
Also, because this video is their project, it should be filmed.
Seeing that this is the first year of drama lessons, it is not very well known.
Also they are putting on their first play on the 2nd of July.
Part of the show could be filmed.
Considering that the school's maths team won this year's city maths competition and is going on to the national schools' maths championship, it would be a good idea to film some of their training courses and also ordinary maths lessons which the majority of the students attend.
To show life at the school we need not only lessons and exams, the video should also include the annual summer fete, the school's weekend trip which is on Friday 7th of July, and also the dance which is organized on the last day of the school year.
Thank you for informing me that I have won the first prize in your competition of two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
I will be pleased to send the further information which you need.
Once again, thank you for sending me some information.
I feel it will be the best holiday I have ever had.
I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.
Who does not like shopping? Perhaps it is just men or anybody who has a lack of time or if you are looking for something particular to buy and the shop has no variety.
Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would spend my entire life shopping.
Although I am someone who loves shopping, I cannot stand .
However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and at the same time.
It leads to overcrowded shops, high-pitched noise, a lack of parking places and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole thing is just about enough to drive you crazy.
Despite knowing the difficulty we do not avoid shopping on those days.
On the other hand, some companies offer special services, such as sending your order by post or taking it on the telephone.
It could be the way to avoid busy times or days.
Do not take your child with you; choose the right shop which has a car park.
I have received your letter: I was very glad to know that I have won two weeks at Camp California.
I have to take part in basketball competitions all year long, except during July, so that is the only month in which I can travel.
I would be grateful if I could stay in a log cabin: I would prefer not to stay in a tent because of my height; I am so tall that I could never stand up.
I would like to play basketball because my trainer said that it would be advisable not to stop training during July.
I can play basketball very well.
I would be grateful if you could teach me to play golf.
I have never tried this sport, so I can't play golf at all.
Would you mind sending me some information about the kind of clothes I will need? I would like to know how much money you suggest bringing.
I would be grateful to receive some information about the meals at the camp and I hope that it will not be a problem for you if I am a vegan.
I think that if we want to show the good points of our typical school day, we should film the large number of sports activities that this school organises because students are compelled by them to come to school with enthusiasm.
Only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball...
or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
It would be nice to film an Ancient Greek poetry lesson because the Ancient Greek teacher is very good at explaining; she is excellent at catching our attention and she wants everyone to tell the class the impressions and emotions they have reading Saffo, Alceo, Alcmone....
I have received your letter about the prize I have won in your competition.
I would like to thank you and give some of the information you asked about me.
Re the time: I am a student and have examinations until the end of June.
The only convenient time to travel is in July.
I hope you can arrange this.
Re activities: During the two weeks I would like to do tennis and swimming.
I have regularly played tennis since I was nine years old and I have entered several competitions.
Swimming is another sport I learned when I was six.
Do you remember the concert I helped at? It was absolutely amazing.
My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans.
We started at 7 pm to let them into the concert area.
I had to tear off a part of every single ticket.
This part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my and went to help at the security section.
Here, I had to check the bags and coats of the girls.
Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things in with them, like knives or scissors.
So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags.
I really felt like a security guard.
It was a great experience.
I had a serious duty and also a lot of fun.
I met new people who I still see.
I would like to introduce them to you.
I'm so glad I won this prize, but I have some questions for you, and of course, the information you asked me for.
Well, first, I would like to travel only in July, because it's my holiday here in Portugal.
And if it's possible I would like to go after the 10th, because I've got some things to do.
I was walking down the main street looking for a gift shop (I had to buy something for a friend, it was his birthday), when I found a beautiful store.
I stopped in front of it and started looking at the window display (outside), then I thought it was interesting and went in.
Suddenly, I saw a man with a cap covering his face.
I tried to look again to see him better, because he seemed to be very handsome.
And then he said, "If you promise me you won't go out of this store shouting and screaming and telling everyone that I'm here, I will take this cap off of my face." I didn't know what to do.
I was sure he was a Robber, or even a murderer! Then I said, "OK, I promise!" (frightened, of course).
Carefully, he took off the cap.
Tina, guess WHO he was? Ricky Martin!! Can you believe it! And there's more! He asked me if I could help at his concert here in São Rafael.
Because the store manager told him that I was the best hairdresser in the city! And his hairdresser was sick, so he and his producers were looking for one.
Isn't that amazing? I met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of photographs with me and gave me an autographed Record.
Tina, I'm the luckiest girl in the world, don't you think? I'll send you some photos.
- I would prefer to travel in July as this is the only time I can take my annual leave.
- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become awkward for me.
Please let me know if meals are included and if not what facilities are offered in the way of restaurants or self-catering.
The book Cry Freedom by John Briley is certainly one which will take its place in South African history.
Therefore, I think it is a historical document which will remain of interest and which will be read again and again, by non-South Africans as well as South Africans.
Generations of young South Africans, black, white or brown, will be reminded of one of the worst times their country went through.
Steve Biko and Donald Woods will be remembered always.
Steve Biko for becoming a martyr to the black freedom movement of those dark years - a peaceful man who was caught up in the wiles of the apartheid regime, dying such a violent death.
Donald Wood for literally and risking his life and that of his family in the process of reporting the vile crimes of the SA.
police force.
In the end he had to leave the country of his birth to escape imprisonment.
It is my firm belief that this book will remain a work of literature which will not lose its relevance in a world where people are hounded for their colour or religion.
Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize.
It seems so exciting.
I really look forward to taking part in Camp California.
I would like to travel in July because my examinations will be finished on June 15th.
And I have a plan to go to visit my parents in Bangkok, Thailand, in the middle of August.
So, I think July is the best time to go to the Camp.
In addition, the weather may be nice at that time of year.
For accommodation, I would prefer tents because I am used to them.
Because I'm not good at sport, I will choose singing and photography as my activities.
When I was studying at university I joined the Photo Club where I taking photos.
As I love singing and always spend my free time doing Karaoke to practise, I think my singing is not too bad.
I also have a couple of things to ask you.
What type of clothes and how much money do I need to bring? I would be delighted if you could advise me.
"Shopping is not always enjoyable".
I strongly agree with this sentence.
I used to go shopping a lot when I was at university.
I was 19 years old but I spent over 200 pounds some weeks just to keep myself fashionable all the time.
I bought lots of new, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes.
Four years at university I never had any savings.
Now, I hate shopping because I spent a lot when I was young, as mentioned.
So I came to the conclusion that shopping is a way to waste time and money.
I found that it's not worthwhile when I went to the southern part of Thailand 3 years ago where I met an old man and his little grandson.
They were very poor.
The money that I spent on shopping could have helped them a lot if I had not spent it already.
His little grandson tried to help his grandfather, who was 70 years, old by working as a gardener after school, though he was only 10 years old.
This thing told me shopping was not enjoyable any more.
I would like to give you some information.
First of all, I would like to travel on the 19th of July and come back on the 2nd of August, because I have to work until 19th of July.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have stayed in log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it.
This time I want to try something different.
I would also like to tell you about my free-time activities.
I like painting and climbing.
I am actually not so good at climbing, but I like the fear of risks and danger.
My painting is not bad, but many people don't like the way I paint, because I use only .
I am happy`,, because I will have the chance to do these two activities.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I should take a lot of clothes with me, because I do not know what the weather is like there.
My last question is: how much money do I need? I hope I have answered all your questions.
Shopping is not always enjoyable.
If I had the choice, I would never go shopping in the big supermarkets.
You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can't find the items that you want to buy.
When I was at the supermarket last week, I suddenly decided not to buy from a supermarket at all.
First of all, you need a lot of time, because the shop is so big.
Secondly, you have a lot of choices and you do not know what to buy.
Lastly, there is a recycling problem, which many people do not care about.
You buy a lot of items without thinking where so much rubbish should go.
I think a lot about this issue, and sometimes I do not even want to use water, although I should .
I think I am too sensible.
I prefer to go to street markets.
You can ask about the quality and prices and get an answer immediately.
In my opinion, small shops and the street markets should be supported.
On the other hand, the big supermarkets should think more about the recycling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.
It was a real joy to receive your letter and I still can't believe it.
In answer to your letter, you will find below the information you need.
I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel in July.
I can't change the date I start work because I signed the contract a month ago.
I hope that will not cause you problems.
Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin.
It would be better to leave money or anything in without worrying about theft.
I've always dreamed about climbing but I have never had the opportunity to try this sport.
When I saw that you offer this sport, I was really excited.
So I choose climbing as a beginner.
For the second activity, I will choose sailing.
I've been sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it.
Moreover I have been a sailing teacher .
Life at school is made of several things.
First, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us with.
But there are also a lot of clubs and activities that form part of the daily life of pupils.
That's why they both have to be taken into account in the video we will make.
The most interesting lessons for pupils are lessons in which they can do something real, concrete.
For example, the engineering or physics lessons are very interesting, especially the practical work.
It would be great if we showed these in our film.
It might also be very interesting to watch it.
As for other activities, we could probably show one of our sports teams training.
For example, the basketball team which has won the student regional title (we can also say that) or the football team.
After all, it is not important which one we will show, but I think we must create a good picture of the school through sport.
Firstly, I can travel only in July because I'm studying at college until the end of June and in August I'm travelling to Greece for one month.
Secondly, I would like to stay in log cabins because it would be more spacious and comfortable than tents.
I'll tell you the two activities I chose.
I would like to play tennis and swim.
I belong to a tennis club and it is my favourite sport.
I sometimes have a match with friends.
I go swimming once a week.
I like swimming because I can relax in water.
Generally, women like shopping.
They like looking for fashionable clothes, bags, shoes and so on.
In the bargain season, all shops are full of people who are keen on finding stuff which is good value for money.
You can see battles between two people who want the same thing sometimes.
The most interesting thing is that many men are waiting for their wives or girlfriends outside the shop during shopping.
They don't fancy going into the crowded shop.
It is very boring and tiring to be kept waiting.
For the women, too.
If they can't find things which they expected, they go there only to get tired.
I received your letter congratulating me for having won the first prize in your competition.
I am very grateful and I want to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip.
I think it is very kind of you to ask me what my preferences are regarding the trip.
I ought to let you know that I can only travel in the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays start.
To answer another of your questions, I am more likely to want to stay in a log cabin, considering that I will be two weeks in the camp.
They are much more comfortable than tents.
While I am at the camp I would love sailing and climbing.
I have not done either of these activities before, but now that I have the chance I want to take advantage of it.
I would be very glad if you could let me know what kind of clothes I should take, and how much money you think I will need to bring with me.
I am delighted to reply to give you more information about me since I have won such a nice prize.
The list of activities that you have is very interesting so my choice was very difficult to make but I have finally decided to choose sailing because I have been sailing for five years now and enjoy it very much.
My second choice is climbing because I have never climbed and would like to have a go at it.
Like most of the girls, I enjoy shopping but it can be either a great event or a nightmare.
What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is to wander around and to look at everything.
Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it into an enjoyable experience.
The nightmare starts when you find out that the items you like the most are also the most expensive.
Then, you decide to wait for the sales but they are even worse as everybody wants to do their shopping at that time and the streets are so crowded you cannot even look for your favourite items.
You are hot in the shops, feel annoyed and most of the time cannot find anything you want.
To conclude, I would say that to have a nice time shopping you had better save a lot of money and buy something as soon as you see it or be very patient.
I was grateful for your message.
I can gladly give you some information which you need.
I would be able to travel only in July because I have a job at the moment, but it will be my vacation in July.
I would prefer to be in tents, so that I can enjoy a natural life more than being in log cabins.
Moreover, it would be more exciting for me.
I'm sorry that I haven't written to you for a long time.
It was nice you wanted to hear about my experience, and I know you're looking for a job .
It was a wonderful opportunity for me.
As you know, I love music.
Before the concert started, I cleaned the stage for the singers and I gave some drinks to the singers.
Finally, I cleaned the stage again.
My work was for the singers, so I could meet singers and talk with them.
In particular, I liked cleaning the stage, because I could stand on a famous singer's stage and I could feel his enthusiasm, even though I had to clean it.
I am sad to read about Richard not being well.
I hope that he will recover soon and that he will make it to our conference.
As far as the organisation is concerned, an adequate number of double rooms with shower or bath have been booked for your group at the Palace Hotel, located across the main street from the train station.
To come to our college, you can either walk downhill to the lakeside (about 10 mins) or take the new cable car from the train station.
The college is just steps away from the bottom end.
'Where are you?' is very often the first question that you will be asked when answering the phone.
Why? Because somebody has invented the most popular communication device ever.
Due to the mobile phone, communication has changed, not improved.
I am writing to reply to the letter you wrote to me on 10 June.
Firstly, I would like to tell you that the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located beside the congress house in the centre.
You can make contact with Mrs Brackenbury 06 8793888.
Secondly, the best way to get from the hotel to the conference is to take the bus, which has been specially organized by us.
The bus leaves at 8:00 every morning and gets back to the hotel at 6 o'clock in the evening.
Of course there's also a number 8 bus, in front of the hotel, which is also suitable, but it leaves only every half an hour.
The end-of-conference party, which will be in the evening on 20 June, is going to be held on the coast.
Beside the barbecue, there will be some well-known student bands from our country playing music through the whole night.
What's more is that there's a Latin music band coming to make the party more colourful.
It will play from 10:00 to 11:00, .
The main events of the party will be at about 12:30 in the night.
As you see, what to wear is just something casual.
Finally, on the last afternoon, we could visit the museums and markets (we have a very interesting robot-market).
Basically it's free time for the students to look round by themselves.
I hope your questions have been answered appropriately.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
First of all, the efficiency of society has been improved.
When shopping, we don't need to wait for the cashier to by hand.
When booking a flight, we can just make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute.
Secondly, instead of tons of books to get the information that we need, we can very easily search for it on the Internet or on the local network.
It's very often heard that someone who has a rare illness has had an operation at a foreign institute which he found via the Internet.
Moreover, with computer networks, it is possible for people to work from home, projects, controlling operations or conferences.
Lastly has also changed.
Instead of traditional telecommunications, we can talk by, e-mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network.
Of course there're also some aspects in which computer technology needs to be improved.
For example, reading on the screen is still not as comfortable as reading on paper.
A very important and severe problem is reliability and security.
So far, it is still somehow not safe enough to completely rely on computers.
In conclusion, computers have become a necessity in our life, and it's still a young invention, which needs to be improved.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
Because it is a well-known hotel it should be easy to find it.
Moreover, it is really well located so it will allow you to move around the city without any problem.
More importantly the conference is going to take place in the Exhibition Centre, which is located only five minutes' walk from the hotel.
We haven't so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes, although you can come well dressed, if you feel better that way.
After the conference we are going to have an informal dinner in order to introduce ourselves to each other.
Finally, in my opinion, you should visit the Art Gallery.
It will take you two or three hours but it's a gorgeous place.
I look forward to hearing from you.
"Sagrada Familia", a real holy building.
If you are looking for a special building in Barcelona, which you will like whatever your tastes are, you should visit the "Sagrada Familia".
Among the large number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of Catalonian modernist art.
Gaudi conceived of this church in 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it.
Since the beginning the work has been interrupted at different times and started again.
After Gaudi's death three years later.
Nowadays, hard work is being done in order to finish it as soon as possible.
The visitor can wander around the whole building or follow a guided tour.
There is an exhibition room where maps and plans can be .
And, unless you suffer from a heart problem, you should climb the 350 steps which carry you to the top.
There you can enjoy a terrific view.
Not only will you see almost all the city but also you will discover another perspective of this magnificent building.
As you know, I am in charge of organising the conference in my college.
Do not worry if Richard did not leave you all the information.
I am pleased to help you.
We looked at every hotel in town, trying to give you the best offer.
We found two good hotels and we decided on the Palace Hotel.
This has the best price that we could find.
The conference day our school driver is going to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the conference.
The party is going to be in a local discotheque near the college so the best way to get there is to walk.
You do not have to wear any special kind of clothes but in my opinion you can wear very casual clothes.
Finally, on the last day I suggest you go to the mall where you can enjoy shopping and looking around.
The aim of this report is to recommend you to visit the Fuerte de San Diego Museum.
This is a historical building.
I asked some people in town and this was the best place to choose.
The Fuerte de Sandiego Museum was built at the time when the Spanish people were trying to take all the lands from Mexico, one of the most important people who was at front of the Fuerte was Hernon Cortez, than anyone at that time.
The Museum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco.
It is situated on the top of a little mountain in the "old" part of the city.
You are able to get there by car or on foot and see everything which was made at that time.
On the whole, this is the best building in Acapulco for its history and reputation.
It is the best place to go and it is easy to get there.
as the leader of the conference-organisation, I'm glad if I can help you.
My hope is that nothing goes wrong.
So you have to know more details about our conference.
Your hotel is called Palace Hotel and it is located in the city centre.
As far as I know, this hotel is very comfortable.
There is also a subway-station near Palace Hotel.
Our college is not very far away.
You only have to take the subway-train.
After three stations you have arrived at Brooklyn street.
When you come out of the subway you see our college.
The conference starts at 6 o'clock and ends at 8 o'clock.
The students have prepared a music programme for the end-of-conference party.
There will also be an international buffet.
So don't eat too much before you come.
And please don't worry about clothes.
There are not any rules.
The telephone is a very important invention, which has affected our lives.
It is a way for people to communicate although they are in two different places.
People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life.
In my opinion people need a telephone.
For example a telephone is very important in professional life.
Nowadays, there are no companies which do not have a telephone.
Also it is good for people's safety.
You can call the police if you are in danger or the ambulance if you are injured.
People also use the telephone in their personal life.
For example, when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away.
Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone.
They are able to give and receive information very quickly.
This invention has made our lives easier and .
The telephone has also made my own life easy and .
Finally, I would say that the telephone is very efficient for people.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, a five star hotel, which offers many facilities.
It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms.
The students can get there on the No 35 bus.
They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stops at Palace Station.
The hotel is opposite the station.
At the end of the conference, the college, in which the conference will be held, gives a party for all the students.
They will be offered light food, like sandwiches, pommes frites, chips, sweets and different drinks - no alcohol.
There will be live music and the students can dance and enjoy themselves.
It would be better to wear casual clothes, because they are more comfortable and are liked by students.
On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to.
The group can also visit the zoo, the opera or stay and relax in the college's enormous garden and enjoy the scenery.
Location: The castle is in the city centre near an enormous church.
You can get to the city centre on the No.456 bus and then go on foot to the castle.
Service: It is over 100 years old but it is kept in good condition by the local people, who are proud of this castle.
Activities: At the time of the year you will visit Nyremberg, many theatrical plays or concerts are taking place in the castle.
View: From the castle you can have a wonderful view of the whole town, especially at night when all the lights are on.
It is a different experience.
History: At the castle there are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
I am writing with reference to your last letter concerning the international student conference in our college.
I will give you the information you have requested.
First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group.
This hotel is quiet and near the conference building.
However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport.
Furthermore, as usual, we will organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wore a suit (for a man) or a skirt (for a woman).
Furthermore, this party will be in your hotel as in the previous years.
Finally, there are a lot of museums in our town.
Therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fascinating.
subject: Aboriginal Art Museum.
The aim of this report is to describe the biggest building of our town.
I am in a position to choose a good building which students like myself are interested in.
a) This museum exhibits more than 200000 original art pictures.
b) The building was built in 1999.
Therefore, it is an example of modern architecture.
c) This building is as high as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
d) This building 30 toilets, 500,000 lights, and also 100 people who can help you if you need any information.
I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the oldest civilisation in the world in one of the most modern buildings.
I received your letter this morning and I would like to thank you for your interest in the conference.
I hope I can answer your questions.
First, this international student conference has the aim of explaining to students how important education is.
In addition to this, we have chosen the luxury Palace Hotel, which is comfortable enough and in a good location.
The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can come by train, by bus or by car.
I suggest you should go by train and get off at Museum Station.
The conference will be held in the hotel, which is .
The conference, , is quite well organized.
It will start at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon.
I suggest you should wear something informal.
Even though we want to make things as comfortable as possible for our students.
I am very happy that you want to know about my area, although I am afraid an afternoon is not enough.
However, if you want, you can call me and I can show you some interesting places.
I will be very glad.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Cars, boats, motorbikes, airplanes: Who has never used them once? This is a good question.
People always seem to be running and the fastest of these inventions is certainly the airplane.
At First, when Santos Dummont invented the airplane, he probably didn't think how people could transform his creation.
In this world, where the nations fight to be the best , the airplane became the most important thing in the war.
Unfortunately, it was used to kill a lot of people.
However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some .
How could a person go from Brazil to Australia without it? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definitely by air.
With this invention travel around the world is so much easier.
Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the inventors who invented for us.
Thank you for your letter.
Of course I will give you some more details about the student conference.
First of all the hotel Richard Brown has looked at is the Palace Hotel.
It's located close to the main train station in our town.
It is quite near the conference building.
There will be extra buses to get there.
The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entrance.
The end-of-conference party will be a small dinner for all the students.
You do not have to wear special clothes, just wear what you always wear.
If you take your uniform with you it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel and wear something else.
There are many things you could do for this short time on the last day.
You could visit our famous Museum of Art or go for a walk along the lakeside.
If you want to do something for fun or entertainment, go bowling.
Our church is a very famous building in our country.
It is eighty metres long and its tower is forty-five metres tall.
On the top of the tower it has a huge clock on each side.
The tower is red and the church itself is painted white.
In the church are many expensive drawings.
There is space for about five hundred people.
The church was built in 1385.
It was rebuilt in 1948 because of the Second World War, when it had been damaged.
The church is located in a place where you can see the whole Rigi mountain chain.
Visit our church because it is one of the most famous churches in our country.
It has an interesting past.
The tower is absolutely marvellous.
You can walk to the top of the tower and it gives you a beautiful view.
If you want to visit the church, there will be a special guide who will show you all the things and answer your questions.
Entry is free.
.
In this letter you will get all the information that you need.
After the party, we will go to an to have fun and we will eat in Mc'Donalds.
The rest you already know.
I suggest wearing shirts and jeans.
And the last three hours before you return, we can go to the "Imax" cinema to watch a 3-D film! Afterwards we will eat in the KFC.
Then we will all take you and the students to the airport.
That's everything.
I you.
Madrid is a big city and has many interesting places.
But the best place for me is "La Vaguada", an and commercial building.
In there, students can have fun in the recreation areas, can watch a film and eat all kinds of food and go shopping.
We can have fun as well.
And that's why I recommend this place to you.
The building itself is a large building.
It is very safe as there are policemen and cameras.
The building seems to be very new but it is quite old.
People love this place and called it "Madrid Two".
Around it, there are many restaurants and shops as the building attracts a lot of people.
Inside, there are fast-food restaurants and shops as well.
And it is easy to get to.
Just take the 83 bus or the subway.
In here, you can find everything that you want.
Hope you like it.
I received your letter and I'm happy to help you.
We booked the Palace Hotel for your group.
It's nice and quiet.
I'm sure you'll be fine here.
We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too.
So you are going to get to the conference in a few minutes.
When you go out of the hotel turn right and go straight on; turn right again at the first crossroads.
At the end of this street you can see our college on your left.
It's a green building.
At the end-of-conference party there'll be something to eat and to drink.
In the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college.
You'll see all the generations who passed through here.
Clothes aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people wear something different from the usual jeans.
Here we have a lot of great things to do, but the best you can do in about three hours is visit the art museum.
We are all looking forward to seeing your group.
What would our world be without television? It isn't easy to give an answer to this question.
Television is an important invention.
It has given us a better means of communication.
This animated box can give us a lot of information from all around the world.
Television has affected the ",,, too.
We can spend a lot of time enjoying ourselves with some programmes, all that we have to do is watch.
And we like that, because it's easier doing nothing than engaging ourselves in something that makes us do something.
So television can be a positive or a negative invention.
It depends on what use we want to make of this box.
Now we should be able to answer the question.
No, I don't think so.
Television has become so important for us that we can't imagine .
I am writing to answer your letter about the details of the international students conference.
The Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is on the North City Line, which is the yellow line on the map.
After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station, which is twenty minutes away.
It is opposite the conference venue.
The conference which, will be held from 1 pm through 4 pm, is a formal party.
You should wear formal clothes, and are going to play a game and enjoy a welcome drink together.
I am writing to answer your question about an interesting building to visit.
I would like to introduce one building in my town.
"Sky Heaven", which is the name of the building, is fifteen minutes from the centre of my town.
This building has a hundred floors and it takes five minutes to go from the ground to the top in the elevator.
There are many attractions such as a museum, an exhibition and many gift shops where we might also enjoy going shopping.
The reason for my recommendation is that Sky Heaven is the tallest building in the world.
You should go to the top of the building and enjoy an amazing view.
Another reason is that there is a good museum, which you about the history of my town so easily and clearly.
It will be a good experience for your students.
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the international student conference.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube.
The location of the conference is then five minutes by foot.
At the end of the conference there is a party, where we can eat something, dance and speak to each other about the conference.
I hope that I have been able to give you some help.
And I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
I am writing a report, in which I will describe for you the most important building in my town.
The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda".
It is the big old house of a rich lord in the middle of the town.
In this house there is a big museum, where you can learn about the history of Biasco.
Under the museum there is a big dark place, where the wine is produced.
Your American students could learn how the ,,Meriot ticinese" is produced and why it is so famous in Tiano.
I think that these suggestions could interest your students.
Also Biasco, with its ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda", is the middle point of two - Leventina and Blenio - and the middle point of two similar but also different cultures too.
I hope that this information will encourage you to visit Biasco and its ,,house".
I am sorry to hear that Richard Brown isn't well and hope he'll get better soon.
I am more than happy to give you the necessary information.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only 2 miles away from our college.
The college will arrange for a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive at the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15.
The reason we don't suggest you walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.
As you already know, we are going to have an end-of-conference party where the Head of the college will give a short speech at the beginning, then there will be a buffet and a disco.
You don't need to dress up smartly but please, make sure that your students don't wear shorts or trainers.
Regarding what you could do in your free afternoon on the day you leave I would suggest you take the students to our History Museum.
It's not very big but it has got some amazing information about the history of our town and their people.
There is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
I hope I've answered all your questions but if you need any more information, please let me know.
In my personal opinion one of the most important and useful things which has been invented is the car.
Cars play a big part in our life.
Everywhere you look you can see cars.
More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport.
Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport.
You don't have to wait at a bus stop in cold and windy weather for a late bus, or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs.
You can just jump into a car, tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.
Cars are even more important for emergency situations such as a fire in a house or if somebody is critically ill.
Could you imagine if our police, doctors or fire-fighters had to get somewhere quickly on foot? I don't think I need to comment on this.
From my personal experience I realised how it's important to drive a car when I was living in Johanesburg in South Africa.
I arrived there with my family when my daughter was only 4 months old and I couldn't drive at that time.
Johanesburg is a very dangerous place to live.
I couldn't just go for a walk, it was too dangerous.
There was no public transport and I had to stay in the complex where we lived most of the time, and rely on other people to take me to a shop or the doctors or anywhere else.
There I soon realised that I had to learn how to drive if I wanted some quality of life for my daughter and myself.
I am writing to give you some information about an international student conference.
First of all, the hotel which the group has been booked into is The Princes Hotel.
It is very near York Railway Station, from which you can get there easily.
By rail: get off at York station and you can walk from the station.
Turn left and the hotel is on your left-hand side.
By bus: most of the buses in York City Centre pass the station, or you can take a taxi.
Secondly, the conference is a very important event for all of us.
We to wear formal dress.
For example, men should wear suits, ties and so on.
In addition, at the end-of-conference party, we also have a country dancing show.
It could be very special because all the dancers are from our group.
Finally, on the last day we have an afternoon free.
It would be great if we could go for a walk around the city of York and visit the historic buildings.
If you could think of any other ideas that would be very kind of you.
I will be pleased if my idea and all this information can help you.
Nowadays, a lot of things are invented and make our lives more convenient than in the old days.
A car is one of the inventions which are very useful.
In fact, there are buses (number 843 and 845) which go past my village but the bus fares are very expensive for me.
Apart from that it takes a long time to go somewhere.
The car has significantly affected my life.
I can go anywhere by car a lot quicker than by using public transport.
I can listen to the radio and sometimes can listen to Thai music, as I brought some cassettes with me from Thailand.
I took a driving-theory test last October and I passed it and I will take a practical driving test very soon.
I think I have to drive the car myself, so that I will know more about the advantages of using a car.
It was such a pleasure to receive your letter, and we will be extremely glad to see you at the conference we have been organising.
Let me give you some further information concerning the event.
Firstly I would like to inform you about the hotel we have already booked for you.
It is called the Palace Hotel, and we hope that it is going to meet your expectations.
The conference is not too far from your hotel.
I strongly recommend you to use public transport in order to get there, because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive.
Moreover, you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two hours, until 10:00 pm.
After that our college has organised a barbecue night, with traditional local music that you must not miss.
You don't need to wear formal clothes, just everyday clothes.
Finally, I am aware of the fact that on the last day you have some hours free before you catch your plane.
Don't miss the chance to visit our famous tourist attractions.
There is also a huge shopping centre where you can buy some souvenirs or taste some of our traditional food.
Welcome to Athens!! Without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
Don't miss the chance to visit the historical museum, located in the heart of the capital city.
A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century, the historical museum is simply a symbol, a of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: their freedom.
There are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing, famous paintings having as their main subject the revolution of 1821, and aspects of the Greek religion that have always been considered to be a vital part of Greek history.
There is a small entry fee.
Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books, maps etc.
Thank you for your letter and I will try to help you.
I must remind you that the international student conference will be next month on the first of July.
The hotel that we booked is the Palace Hotel, which is near the bus station.
When you are in the bus station you will catch bus number 37, which will go to the town centre.
From there you will walk to the college because it is easier to get there that way than to get another bus.
Anyway the college is the first road on your right from the town centre.
After the conference some food and drink will be available in the sports centre, which is well equipped for discos.
Our party has a special theme: 'Western'.
So we suggest wearing cowboy-style clothes.
On your last day you could go to the sports museum, which is great and famous around the world, or just go for a walk around Reconvillier Park.
I hope that I have answered all of your questions and that the conference will be great.
Introduction: I am writing to describe the location and architecture for you and tell the story of the old Roman school of Courtelary.
I hope that you will go there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful things to see.
It is the only old Roman school in the world.
Location: Courtelary is situated in Switzerland and the school is on the top of the town's hill.
This place is very important because it is there that an emperor grew up.
Architecture: It is a typical from this epoch with beautiful on the wall and in the sports centre.
The door is enormous because for them the entrance was very important.
History: It all began when Ogus Micius said that Romans needed to go to school.
They decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever.
During the Second World War all the schools were demolished and only ours is left.
Conclusion: I have given you a lot of reasons to go to this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip to my town.
I am writing to answer your question.
Firstly, I have already booked the Palace Hotel for the students.
That is the hotel near my college.
It takes five minutes to get to my college on foot.
I will .
Secondly, I will tell you about the end-of-conference party.
It will start at six o'clock.
The party will be held in the dining room.
The people who will attend the party include many professors, semi-professors and .
So I suggest that the students should wear formal clothes.
Finally, I will give you some ideas for .
.
For example, there are many shrines, temples, and castles.
I suggest that you should visit these places.
You will have a good time.
In addition, there are many other colleges.
You will be able to meet many Japanese students.
I am looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
If you would like to get more information, you .
My town is the capital of Japan.
So there are many tall buildings.
I think it is like New York.
However, there is only one building which I want you to visit.
The name of the building is 'Sunshine 60'.
This is the tallest building in Tokyo.
I recommend visiting it.
I have three reasons for my recommendation.
Firstly, there is the aquarium in the building.
In addition, there is the 60th floor.
When I went there the first time I couldn't believe it.
Finally, there are many shops inside the building.
You will have a good time shopping.
I hope when you visit .
You should go there.
Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter asking for my help with the conference.
I would like to do my best to help you.
Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked for the group's accommodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about travelling to the conference.
The hotel has its own buses, they will take us from the hotel to the conference .
Secondly, I would like to tell you more about the end-of-conference party.
I booked the Palace Hotel's restaurant for our party and it is big enough for your students.
It is going to be very and enjoyable because I have lots of surprises for the students.
, I suggest that they should wear and comfortable clothes.
Finally, you would like to know about some activities for three hours of free time.
I think you can go to the 'Dreamland'.
In this place there are video games, some little competitions and a small zoo available.
Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way to the airport.
1.
This building's name is 'Anitkabir' and it is the biggest building in Ankara.
It was built in 1953.
It is located in the middle of the forest.
There are different kinds of birds and different kinds of trees present.
2.
There is a very big museum inside the building and all the building is made from stone.
3.
This building's security guards are very special soldiers.
Their aim is to protect the building from enemies because there is also a very big army museum available.
I think that it is the best building in Ankara to visit because it  Turkish history and very good sightseeing.
I am writing in reply to your letter about the international student conference.
The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel.
It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car.
It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total number of members in your group is 4 and a taxi fare would not be expensive.
There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel.
Regarding the end-of-conference party on Thursday, it starts at 7 p.m.
in the garden of the college.
You can wear either casual dress or fancy dress because we are having a fancy-dress competition and the prize is a bottle of French champagne.
On Friday afternoon, some free time.
Therefore, you can go shopping in the town centre, which is near the college.
Many beautiful and traditional souvenirs can be found there.
The other suggestion is going to the flower market, which is very famous for tourists because it covers 2 acres and there are plenty of flowers to buy.
Moreover, it is the biggest flower market in this area.
There are many sources of light in this world, such as sunlight, moonlight and candlelight.
Some of them are natural whereas the others are not.
Owing to an increasing demand for light, for more activities, the natural source is not adequate.
Therefore, electric light was invented.
Nowadays, the electric light has become part of our lives, especially during the night.
Whatever we do at night, we need electric light.
In addition, the electric light is the of other electric equipment and they have become an important part of our life, too.
I think we should be grateful that we have got the electric light for our lifestyle.
I was very pleased to receive your letter.
It is my pleasure to help you with organising the international student conference.
Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the town centre.
Students can take the airport bus directly to the hotel when you arrive.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
Therefore it is no good taking a bus.
I will help you to book the coach.
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at the college's main hall, from 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June.
There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided.
Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on.
Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wear to it, as they are suitable for dancing.
Finally, on the last day, I suggest you go to the market in town during the 3-hour gap.
It is a nice place to buy British-style gifts for your family and friends.
You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby.
I would be pleased to give any help you need.
I am looking forward to seeing you.
The purpose of this is to give information to the American students describing Po Lin Temple, which is worth visiting.
It was founded in 1910.
It is a traditional type of Chinese temple.
Because of the 2nd World War, it was re-built in 1960.
A big Buddha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, and it is the largest outdoor Buddha in the world.
The location of Po Lin Temple is on Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong.
Po Lin Temple is open to the public from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm on Monday to Friday, and 9:00 am to 5:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday.
You could take the MTR (HK underground) straight to Lotus Island or take the ferry to get there.
Then you need to take the bus, an A110, A111 or A112, to Po Lin Temple.
It is quite convenient.
All the buses and the MTR have air-conditioning.
You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos.
Of course, you may acquire a greater knowledge of Hong Kong, as the temple has been here for nearly 100 years.
You mustn't miss the famous Big Buddha, or you will be sorry.
The temple also provides free Chinese traditional-style meals for visitors.
To sum up, I think Po Lin Temple is a nice place to visit, especially for Americans students.
It is easy to get there and .
, Hong Kong is known as a highly commercial city, and you could find something different in Po Lin Temple.
First of all I'm sorry to hear that Richard Brown is ill.
As you are the leader of the group instead of him, I'm delighted to give you all the information you have asked for.
The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and, from there to the conference, we have organized the hotel's bus service to take the students to the conference.
We will meet in the lobby at 9.00 AM.
The conference party will last until 1.00 AM, but everybody does not need to stay until the end.
There will be a bus taking students who do not want to stay at the party until the end.
The bus will be at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM, then at the end of the party there will be the last one.
Everybody is free to dress for the party but consider what is appropriate.
On the last day at noon, you could go to the craft centre nearby the Airport.
There are lots of things there you will enjoy watching or buying for friends.
If there is any information you need to know about the conference, please let me know.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference.
It's very hard to decide which invention is the best.
Because all of them are so important in different ways.
As now I'm away from home, the telephone is very important to me.
Having a telephone I can call my mother and my friends, which prevents me from feeling homesick; not completely but I think it's better than .
To hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real.
You can imagine their face clearly.
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch through e-mail.
The problem was the language.
We used English but neither of us were very good at it at the time, which made us misunderstand each other.
However, the problem was solved by a telephone.
We are now still friends.
Thanks to the invention of the telephone.
With reference to the information that you have requested, the hotel that has been booked is the Holiday Inn, in New Port and to get to the University of Wales, which is not far from the hotel, you only need to and once you are on the main road, all you need to do is to follow the country road which takes you directly to the place.
Concerning the party at the end of the conference, this will be formal, therefore you will need formal clothing, as you know there will be company directors, managers etc there.
As for the last day, I would suggest you make a visit to the local museum and the ruins of the Castle.
In the first you will find a very interesting collection of Roman remains, also you can visit another section which is supposed to be a Roman site.
I always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amazing human inventions.
As an example let's have a look and we will see this nation and how it has developed.
We just need to think about the first world and all the inventions created thanks to the industrial revolution .
However, I feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
I think that we have to think about which hotel is best for the students.
I have an idea and I think that you will agree with me.
I was thinking about the Palace Hotel because it's very nice and cheap.
It has comfortable bedrooms and a place for parties.
You can book this hotel.
It's the best and it's near to the conference.
It's only 15 minutes on foot.
I think that it will be nice for the end-of-conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance.
The party will be nice.
Now the clothes that they will wear have to be smart, not the kind you would wear if you were going to a casino for example but nice casual, sports shoes or T-shirts.
On the last day in the afternoon when you have three hours free you can go for coffee or visit some places.
Those are my ideas for the conference.
I hope that you will like them.
Today our article will be about inventions that we need in our life.
I think that we need all these things in our life because they can give us a lot of things.
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make a call if you need something or if something happens to your house and nobody is with you.
.
In the past people didn't have electricity and if they wanted, for example, to read or to cook something they used to light a fire.
It's important to have electricity because without it you can't do anything.
The other one is the television.
You must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to.
You can enjoy watching a film if you have some free time.
A boat is not so important but you can use one for fishing and to see some places.
The car is now very important in our life.
You can go wherever you want.
year .
For me the most important thing is the telephone because without this you can't do anything.
It's part of my life.
First of all, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
It is a big hotel because there will be a lot of people.
It has a swimming pool and a nice bar.
The hotel is ten minutes away from the conference centre and there will be a bus available to go directly over there.
At the end of the conference there will be a dinner in a luxurious restaurant, so people must have nice clothes; jeans are not allowed.
Next to the restaurant, there is a disco for people who like dancing.
We can do a lot of things in my area.
We have the opportunity to visit the old town.
It's very nice and there are a lot of shops.
We can visit the old castle or the painting museum too.
I find television the most important invention.
I think it's good for old people because some of them cannot go to the cinema any more.
On the one hand that's because they haven't enough money to pay for it and on the other hand it's because they can't move very well, for example if they are disabled.
With television, old people are less alone because most old women don't have their husbands any more.
Television is a good way to be informed about the news.
I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers; it's more relaxing.
I think television is a good invention for children, for when they have free time.
While they are watching television, we don't have to look after them if we have something important to do.
I'm very glad to be able to help you out with such a situation.
First of all, the group has been booked into 'THE PALACE HOTEL'.
You won't have any problem finding the college because it's opposite the hotel, and the conference will be there.
You'll have to wear a white shirt and blue trousers.
If you want you will be able to wear a blue jacket.
When we have finished you'll be able to enjoy yourself in our cinema or television room, but if you prefer other things, we've got a swimming pool and a library.
It will be your own choice.
I hope useful for you.
With regard to your request, I'm going to give you some information about which is the best place to visit in this town, Fuengirola.
Fuengirola has a wonderful and beautiful castle which is right on the seafront.
It is situated on the top of a little hill which is part of the beach.
You shouldn't miss the chance to see this castle because there is an excellent view and there are always a lot of people there and there are little shops where you can buy souvenirs.
At the same time you are enjoying the castle you can take a break to go to the beach and you can look at the castle from the sea.
That is also amazing.
Also, there is a museum of history inside.
As you will see, you have to visit the castle.
You won't feel regret about that.
I am writing to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conference and other points in relation to it.
The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel.
It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near to the college where the conference is being held - five minutes' walk.
Walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus.
When you arrive at the colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room.
At the end of the conference we are throwing a party with some cold food and some drinks.
There will be music as well for dancing.
The director of the college has suggested wearing smart clothes for that occasion and I give you the same advice.
I have some suggestions regarding the afternoon before you leave.
In the vicinity of the hotel there are two interesting places to visit.
One is the Picasso museum and the other is an important Gallery where you can enjoy seeing different kinds of paintings.
I hope my information will help you and it has been useful for you.
I am looking forwards to seeing you at the conference.
There is an invention that I think has been very important: the computer.
The computer is very useful and it has affected our own lives in different ways.
The computer has made a lot of jobs easier.
Jobs that you needed, for example, three hours for you can do in ten minutes; ! But computers haven't only affected us in a good way because thanks to computers the number the jobs available for people is smaller.
But they have definitely been a very important invention.
The last with computers is the Internet.
With the Internet you can communicate with people in different places of the world at the same moment.
And you can get lots of information about a lot of things.
You can find everything that you need on the Internet.
You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel, which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here.
The best way to get here is : once you go out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just beside our college.
When you are in the college, ask for me.
The conference will last one hour, and, at 8 o'clock the party will start.
It is a formal party and you should wear formal clothes.
The dress code is no jeans.
We will provide you with food and drinks.
For your free time I have quite a few ideas.
There are lots of things to do here.
We have a museum which is just two minutes from your hotel.
You can also go to a nearby park and eat something in the café.
If you go to the main street you will find a street full of shops and I am sure the students would like that.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
All in all, the invention of this little device is a big plus for everyone.
I am writing to inform you that I have received a letter from you about helping you to organise an international student conference in my college.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is not very far from my college.
However, due to the congestion and near the hotel, the best way to get from there to the conference is on the underground, from Victoria Street Station.
You will arrive at the other station opposite my college in approximately 15 minutes.
At the end-of-conference party, you may either leave the party or stay in the college for more activities.
Different types of clothing can be worn.
However, and T-shirts will be on that day.
Instead of staying in the hotel for the last three hours, I suggest that you perhaps visit our town centre.
The popular attractions in our town, including the art gallery, museum, aquarium, and market square, can be found near the monument of our town, the Saltisy Bridge.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
The Little Woods shopping mall is an ideal place for you and your group to visit.
It is located very close to the town centre next to the town museum.
It can be .
For those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewellery, stationery, bookshops, fashion and beauty departments and many more are available.
For those who want something more exciting and adventurous, you are to visit the Fun Fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building.
Other facilities such as cinemas, theatres, and large department stores can also be found there.
There is a little souvenir shop for tourists and a special discount for tourists from abroad who want to use the car park.
Not only will the tourist information centre provide any information you might need, you can also visit the ICT block, which allows you to .
A special trip could also be organized.
I am writing in connection with your letter about the international student conference.
I if I can offer you my help.
I would like to give you the necessary details, which will help you to organise the conference.
Richard Brown booked the Palace Hotel for the students, which is very comfortable and close to our college.
You need only spend 5 minutes walking to get to the college.
After the conference we are planning to organise a big party with a barbecue.
The party will take place in a forest close to a campsite.
I hope we will have nice weather.
Therefore, I suggest wearing casual clothes.
On the afternoon of the last day, if you have some free time, I would recommend you visit a very famous exhibition of Leonardo Devinci.
The exhibition will take place at the "Gribaldi museum", which you can find on Crariden street, N 5.
You will never regret my suggestion.
If you need more information let me know.
Report on the building at Berkeley Square.
The students who were questioned said that there are a lot of interesting buildings in our city.
However, the majority of people point out one very old building, which you can find at Barkeley Square.
Most of the students found this building very special, because it reflects our history, tradition and culture.
If you visit the building, you will get the impression, the feeling, that you are in the past.
This building attracts a lot of people - because it has a very special style with majestic, antique windows.
Finally I would recommend you visit the Barkely Square area.
In this area you can also find other different buildings, .
I've received your letter asking me for further information about the conference that you are going to organise very soon.
Here you .
First, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is "The Palace Hotel", which is situated at the centre of the town.
It can't be difficult to find, because it is very near to the conference.
Also there is a bus provided by the organisation to take all the students to the hotel.
At the end of the conference there will be a party.
I might suggest you wear a casual outfit, because many students feel like relaxing after a whole day sitting and listening at the conference.
The party will be by a group of musicians, and I remember last year it was unforgettable, because all the people were dancing and having a lot of fun.
It is a well-situated town with a lot of museums to visit, especially "the History Museum", which I visited last year, and I think you will enjoy it .
It doesn't take a lot of time to and entrance is free.
Hoping I've been very helpful to you.
It's impossible nowadays to imagine a life without that invention .
We can't imagine a big company without a phone, which can make business more than anything else.
Also, I have been asking a lot of people in the street: Could you live without a telephone? The answer was always the same: "Impossible".
An old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at "Chicago University".
She told me that every night she expected a call from her son, because .
However, there was one person who told me he wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him, ending a very old tradition.
In my opinion this little "box" that everybody has at home can save your life, especially if you need to ring a doctor in an emergency situation.
In conclusion don't make very long phone calls and you won't have to pay a very expensive bill.
Thank you for your letter.
It's a shame that I won't see Richard because of his illness, but I'm willing to help you as much as I can.
So I will give you some information which you asked for in your letter.
Firstly, about your accommodation, the college which I belong to offers visitors free accommodation with facilities (for example, bath, car park, free internet access, etc.).
located on our campus so you can get to the conference by walking.
Secondly, as you know, we'll have a party after the conference, which will take place at our student council hall .
This party is unlikely to be that formal, but I recommend you don't wear jeans and trainers.
Last, if you have some free time , you should visit Kamakura City, which is 30 minutes from our campus by train.
That is a very traditional Japanese city where there are many temples and monuments.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe become familiar with our culture.
These days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
In our daily life, however, we seldom notice how easy a life we've got or, what is more, how difficult our grandparents found it.
How nasty we are! Let us try to appreciate their importance again.
As for me, the invention which is most important to me is the personal computer.
I have been a full-time student in the university at home, and their classes all require us to have personal computers and use them at all times.
When you take the class on computer programming, you will definitely need one and that holds true for the class on politics, because you have to study statistics on your computer to do social research and some .
My professor said, 'Go and get with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'.
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without thinking.
That's the nature of human beings.
But I think it's not only our fault but evidence of how much they have integrated themselves into our life.
The group has been booked into the Hotel which is near the train station.
It is really easy to get to the conference from the hotel.
The bus runs from in front of the hotel.
If you catch the red bus it will drop you in front of the conference building.
At the conference you should wear formal dress but you are free to choose the colour or style.
At the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
We have arranged some tours of the city.
You will be visiting some interesting places and towers.
Yours sincerely.
Can you imagine life before computers? Lots of books, papers, lots of things on the tables.
A computer is a really clever machine.
It stores all the information, never says enough, and it never forgets any information.
Whenever we want it from it, it doesn't refuse.
It saves time for humankind.
People don't need to spend a lot of time recording everything.
It makes space in offices.
A lot of bosses or workers in factories do not need to employ many clever workers because we don't need a lot .
This saves a lot of money for companies.
Computers have helped to improve health because in this century we can use them in medical operations.
Doctors can manage the most extreme operation easily and confidently.
In general computers have brought human life two centuries forward.
make life easier for us.
I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received yesterday.
Below is some information you will need for the next international student conference at Bournemouth College and some recommendations, which might be useful for the students.
Next you are welcome to attend the party organized at the end of the conference.
It will begin at elevenish p.m.
and may last the whole night.
People are going to be in costume there and it would be a good idea to wear extravagant multi-coloured clothes.
Finally I think that you should jump at the opportunity to go to the historic Pergam's Museum before leaving.
Some of the most amazing masterpieces are exhibited there.
I wish you a wonderful trip and look forward to meeting you in Bournemouth.
As requested I visited the Bournemouth National Museum, which is, to my mind, one of the most interesting buildings of the area.
Below is a summary of the most important points and some recommendations you may need.
The architecture of the building in itself is really breathtaking in terms of luxury and ornamentation .
Even if the architectural style may seem a bit heavy, this building is really a masterpiece with no real comparison anywhere in the world.
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching experience that people never get tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures in each section of the museum.
The adjoining restaurant is very good as well.
The waiters are friendly and always ready to give advice.
In fact it is just what visitors need after their trip through the museum.
To sum up, I would say that this museum is more interesting than the other museums, because you can enjoy not only wonderful masterpieces but also very unusual architecture and a quiet restaurant where you will be able to have a rest if you need to.
Firstly, the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the 'Palace Hotel'.
Secondly, the easiest way to travel from the hotel to the conference is by a local bus.
There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and a no.31 or 3 will take you directly to the conference.
Thirdly, the end-of-conference party will be a small disco, with a variety of drinks and food provided.
Therefore, you can wear something quite casual.
Lastly, on the last day, I would suggest you visit the Edinburgh Castle and the National Scottish Museum, as both of them are very interesting and have a student discount.
I hope this letter can help you with enough information.
We are nearly always surrounded by 'man-made' light.
With it, we read, study, walk, and so on.
In the past people relied on the sunlight, moonlight and the light from fire.
These were, however, very unreliable when the weather was bad and when the fuel ran out.
They had to read, study and walk in the dark.
Today, this kind of thing hardly ever happens! Well, unless there is something wrong with the power supply.
I remember when I was about 5, I visited a museum with my family.
While I was in the toilet, all the lights went off! I screamed and cried since I'd never experienced being in complete darkness before.
When the light was turned on again, I realised how important even a single light bulb can be, and I was sure I could never, ever live without one.
In reply to your letter, I will try to give you some advice.
Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
The conference will take place not far from the hotel so you will see directions to follow.
For the conference, I suggest you wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important people from other colleges.
At the end of the conference, all students and leaders will have a drink.
To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk in the centre of Poitiers which is very beautiful.
I hope I have given you enough details.
I look forward to meeting you at the conference.
It's a modern building with an architecture that you can't see in any other place.
What is impressive about this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building.
In the Pompidou centre, there are different exhibitions on different themes.
In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures.
These exhibitions are often very attractive and they change every year.
Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view over the city.
So if you visit Paris, the Pompidou centre is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many other buildings.
First of all, I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill.
As the conference must go on, I will give you the information you asked for in order to work on this conference.
Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked to stay in a hotel which is very near the place where we are going to have the conference.
The hotel is The Palace Hotel.
It is only 5 minutes' walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference.
Regarding the party, we will have a party at the end of the conference at the hotel where you will stay.
The party will have a relaxed atmosphere so don't worry about what to wear.
There will be only our group, so wear whatever you want and enjoy yourself.
Lastly, .
The shopping centre is just opposite the hotel.
However, some people may want to just wait at the hotel, having a cup of coffee.
The cafe in the hotel is available.
I hope that this information will be useful.
If you have any questions I am more than happy to help.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference.
I, personally, couldn't live without electricity.
It has already and played a great role in my life.
I watch the television and use the computer every day.
Moreover, other facilities in my house, the telephone, air-conditioner, fridge, for example, they all need electricity.
That is why it is very important to my life.
My name is ..., I am a local student and I will give you the requested information.
The rooms for your students have been booked at the Palace Hotel near the city centre.
The hotel is just three bus stops away from our college so you and your students can take the bus from the central bus station that is right in front of your hotel to get to the conference.
The end-of-conference party starts just one hour after the end of the conference.
It is located in our sports hall.
There will be live music and a midnight dinner.
You don't have to appear very dressed, just as you like (there is no dress code - you may wear what you want).
For your last day I think it would be interesting to visit our historic and famous city centre.
I will organize a tourist guide to give us information about the old buildings and sights.
If you have any more questions, write me a short letter.
The invention of the car was a great point in history.
From there on people were mobile and had the opportunity to travel wherever they wanted.
Within of course the physical barriers.
People now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than their home.
In my life the car has an enormous influence.
I come from a rural area.
The next city is 15 km away and there is no bus or rail connection to go there.
It was quite hard for me not to have the for my free time like my friends who lived in or near the city.
I just had no way to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there.
I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go.
I am replying to your letter in which you asked for some information about the conference in Peterborough Regional College.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is situated in the city centre, 15 minutes' walk from where the conference takes place .
On the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College.
The conference will start at 7 p.m., , the 18th of June.
Our director will make a speech afterwards and there will be a party with some snacks, drinks and music.
For the people who are interested in it, there will also be karaoke.
Everybody should wear formal clothes, at least, a little bit formal.
No jeans or tee shirts.
There are a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough.
We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the riverside, which is best if it is a nice day, sunny and warm, for taking a walk.
For details, look at the map on the next page.
Alice knew that is was going to be a very special day for her.
She had a dream where somebody told her that that day would be special.
So, she took the bus, like every morning, and she went to school.
But that day was a little bit different: she had her maths exam.
She had never passed a maths exam and she was really nervous.
Half an hour before the exam she went to the cafeteria to have a cup of tea.
She sat down and, what a surprise, she found a lottery ticket.
Nobody was around her, so she took the ticket, drank her cup of tea and went to the classroom where the exam took place.
She did really well in the exam, she was very surprised, and after the exam she went home.
I have just received a letter from you.
I really appreciate your interest in our conference.
Firstly, the Palace hotel is your accommodation which you have booked.
This is a very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased about staying there.
Secondly, you will have no problems finding the conference.
Obviously, using a taxi is the best but unfortunately it is quite expensive for a student.
However, we have already arranged a mini-bus for you.
The bus will be in front of your hotel at 1 p.m.
and it will take you to the conference.
Thirdly, we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m.
You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have been preparing for 3 months.
But I hope you will wear a formal suit and dress.
You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes.
Lastly, you will not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attractions.
Cambridge bus tour, for example, will be very nice for you because it is the best and the easiest way of getting to know Cambridge.
But if you do not like it, you can enjoy the City centre with a walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge.
I hope you will be happy with our conference and party etc.
We have been preparing all of them for a long time.
Please oblige us with your attendance.
If you want more information, please let me know.
Welcome to my town and I really appreciate your visiting.
I would like you to visit 'COEX' building which is located in Samsung-dong south of Seoul.
I will tell you some information about this building.
This building consists of a world exhibition centre, a multiplex cinema, a huge shopping mall, a huge food court and an aquarium.
Now the world software for Linux exhibition is being held in the exhibition centre.
If you are interested in computers, it will give you great pleasure.
For a multiplex cinema, it is the biggest cinema in Asia and it has 18 screens.
Therefore you can enjoy all the latest films there.
If you want to buy something, especially clothes, the shopping mall, which is called 'COEX mall', will be the best place: very cheap and lots of designer clothes.
Also, you'd better not miss the food court.
It provides all kinds of food.
Korean food, Italian food...
you can enjoy them all.
Lastly, I really want you to go to the aquarium.
Actually I have been there three times but I still want to go there again.
I am sure you will like this very much.
I hope you will enjoy yourself in my town.
I would be very happy if you could be satisfied with my recommendation.
And if you need someone to guide you, please send me an e-mail or give me a call.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Thank you for your letter.
I am writing to give some information on the conference as you requested.
First of all, your group has been booked into Palace Hotel which is very convenient to stay in and has a beautiful landscape.
I would recommend you get to the conference by subway, because the subway station is situated 5 minutes' walk from the hotel.
It will take you about 15 minutes to arrive at the college.
There will be a party after the conference.
We will serve you dinner and some college students are going to sing, play musical instruments and so on, but you can join in if you wish.
Therefore, you had better wear casual and comfortable clothes.
Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on.
You will be able to buy them at a reasonable price.
It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself.
There is a wide range of facilities including theatres, game centres, Korean restaurants.
In particular, people seemed to be satisfied with the theatres, because the screen is massive.
The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular with foreigners.
It seems you can buy everything you want at a reasonable price in the building.
In particular, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap.
However, you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish.
In short, the Amusement Centre is a fascinating place and it deserves a visit.
I would highly recommend this building, because you enjoy yourself but also experience Korean culture which might be exotic to foreign visitors.
Thank you very much for your letter which I received yesterday.
I am sure that together we can a good student conference at my college.
I will now give you some useful information.
First of all, we come to some important points about the organisation.
The group has been booked into a comfortable and well-situated hotel, whose name is the "Palace Hotel".
The hotel is on the right-hand side of Parker Piece, which you can find on the map which I will send you.
The "Palace Hotel" is 5 minutes' walk from the station.
The conference is taking place in the building opposite the bus stop.
After a short speech from our director, the evening entertainment will begin.
In a well-known and pleasant pub in the city centre we have some food and drinks.
Also, there will be a very famous live band.
You do not have to wear formal clothes.
You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoon.
Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something that is special is our cathedral.
The architecture takes you back to the old times.
as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing.
We also have an interesting museum and a modern theatre.
Finally, I am sure you and your group will spend some enjoyable, relaxing days here.
Please do not hesitate to contact me for more information.
I look forward to meeting you soon.
What is it that we use every day for many hours? Sometimes from early in the morning until late in the evening.
Yes, it is the TV.
It is in almost all families, often with a lot of different channels.
First of all, the TV can bring us news in a short time, about what is happening all over the world.
Another point in favour of the TV is that it shows interesting reports, for instance about animals or the different culture of other countries.
Furthermore there are a lot of different programmes, usually something for everybody.
It can also be relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work.
Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can watch the weather and all of them are presented in wonderful colour.
To sum up, in my opinion the TV is a very good and useful invention.
However, it shows a lot of violence which is not good for children.
I cannot imagine living without television, it is something that we need for our education, and for getting news and other helpful information.
Thank you for your letter.
Certainly I'll try to help you as well as I can.
First, I can tell you the name of the hotel.
It's the Palace Hotel.
Fortunately, it is not far from our college.
from the hotel to the conference, you only have to take bus no.7 and get off at St.
James College, where the conference will take place.
About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest, I still don't know who, will be expected.
I suggest wearing casual clothes.
I think there's no need for school uniforms.
To answer your last question, I would propose you attend the local zoo, because many baby animals have been born in the past few days.
Dear Mrs Smith, I hope the information given is useful for you.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century.
Nobody realized how important and how widespread an invention it would be in the future.
Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing.
People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very quick and direct way with the possibility of getting an answer immediately.
When I was a child, we had no telephone at home, and I always had to go to a phone box in the centre of our village.
Now I have my own flat, and the first I bought was the telephone.
I'll never remove it from my home.
I want to inform you that I have already talked to Richard Brown and he informed me about the conference.
Next week I will start organising some events for this conference.
The events will take place at the Palace Hotel, the same hotel that you will be staying at.
The Palace Hotel is opposite Clifton Park, which is near the college.
We chose that hotel because it is near the college and we don't need  transport.
Because you know where the college is and you need to bring some things from the college to the hotel, I think that it is better for all the group to come to the college and then we can all go together to the Palace Hotel.
The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock, you need to be at the college half an hour before.
Concerning the end-of-conference party, I'm thinking about some dance and singing events.
Let me know what you think.
About the clothes that you need to wear, it must be your uniform, because it is the best conference in London and every year lecturers come from other colleges.
Finally, on the last day, we have organised a sightseeing tour around London.
You will have the opportunity of visiting some museums and the zoo .
I think it is a nice idea.
If you want more information you can call me, my telephone number is 047***.
Please, if you have any more ideas, send me a letter.
Nowadays everyone has a telephone.
The telephone is part of our life.
It is one of the most important inventions all over the world.
The telephone is a means of communication.
If you want to talk to your friends, parents, or partner to ask something, you can call them without wondering how you can communicate with them.
Especially if some of your relatives or friends live in another country you can communicate with them every day and you don't feel that they are far away from you.
Today, with the development of technology, the capabilities of the telephone have been improved.
There are telephones that give you the opportunity to talk with more than one person on the line.
Also you can leave a message if you call and can't reach someone.
The latest type of telephone is the mobile phone.
You can use it everywhere and anytime.
Finally, the telephone, except|apart from being a means of communication, is a means of socialisation.
Nowadays we are very busy and we don't have free time to see our friends, but we can call them and talk or chat with them.
Young people especially spend many hours on the telephone and that causes trouble for their parents.
The telephone is a very important invention if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertainment as many people do nowadays.
I have received your letter, which was about .
As you know, a hotel called the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group.
The best way to get from there to the conference is to take a taxi.
I am afraid there are no buses to get there.
We will have a great party at the end of the conference.
The party will be formal, therefore you will have to wear formal clothes like a suit or a dress.
As you know, it is not suitable to wear jeans or something similar.
On your last day you have the afternoon free.
In my area there is a fantastic park, which is the most famous park in the country.
You can find a lot of things to do or to see.
You can visit the zoo or walk around the amazing lake in the park.
I hope you will find all the details which you would like to have in the letter.
If you need any more information, please let me know.
The Power Of Computurs.
How much can a computer affect your life? I think it affects you more than you think.
I meet a lot of people on the Internet and it really interests me.
I learn a lot about their culture by speaking to them on the Internet.
I wasn't able to imagine this before.
In addition to this, today companies can do nothing without a computer.
Everything in this world will work with computers from now on.
Computers have changed my lifestyle, my opinions about the world.
And they affect everyone's life directly or indirectly.
First of all the hotel is the Palace Hotel, 82 Regent Street, so it is very easy to reach the conference.
In fact you can take the number 3 bus; as you can see, the bus stop is just in front of the hotel, then you can get off immediately after the church that you pass, on your right .
Secondly, we will have the party in the hotel at 8.00 o'clock and a buffet will be served at 8.30 p.m.
It will also be possible to get some vegetarian food and drink cocktails free of charge.
I would recommend your students bring their Identity Cards to prove their age.
What is more, I would suggest wearing very smart clothes and for men a tie is obligatory.
Finally, if I were you I would go shopping in the City Centre in your last hours.
However, if you're interested in archaeology you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square.
In the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their car.
It is said that the majority of citizens have got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are becoming more polluted.
On the other hand, this kind of has made our life more comfortable and easier.
In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journeys.
For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
However, I have to say that it has made people lazy and at the same time stressed due to the traffic.
On the other hand one of the main advantages is that we can save time and money as cars have and allow us to get about quickly.
That's why I couldn't imagine my life without one.
If a student is ill, we will return the money but you should tell us one week before we start.
And you are staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located in the town centre.
You can take buses or our school buses.
It costs forty pence.
If you take public buses, it costs more than the school bus.
The end-of-conference party is going to start from Seven o'clock.
One of our teachers, who will be elected by students will make a speech for one hour.
After, a student will make a speech about what he or she has learned, and dinner.
In my opinion, you should wear normal clothes.
I would like to suggest that you should visit building sixty two which is on the sixty second floor.
There are eye-max cinema, museums, a gallery.
This is very famous in our city.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Pusan Castle is located in the South of Pusan.
This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan.
Historical things, pictures and clothes are exhibited there.
It was built four hundred years ago.
When you go up to the top of the castle, you can see the whole town, and there is a very big park in the Castle.
Pusan Castle shows Korean history from when one of our Kings made our country.
etc.
and there are a lot of facilities in Pusan Castle.
A restaurant.
A shop specially for groups.
They can be given a discount.
What is more, every place is explained in English.
So you do not need , but, the entrance fee is a little expensive.
It costs ten pounds.
Fortunately if over ten people visit the castle, they give them a discount.
With reference to your letter which I received yesterday, I would like to give you some details about the international student conference, also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week.
The hotel that is booked for the students is one of the best in the area, it has very good facilities and it is situated near to the place where the conference is going to be.
The best way to get there from the hotel is by bus and it is already booked for the day after you arrive, at 8:30 am.
About the party which is just at the end of the conference, a dance party and the students don't really need to wear special clothes, it's just to have a little dance and meet all the students.
After the party, there is a small trip to the old part of the city and I think it would be a good choice for spending the last three hours that you have left before going back.
I hope this letter answers all your questions, if you want to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter.
The aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago.
They are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
In addition, the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico, for example, it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico.
On the other hand it is far away from the city and it has transport facilities.
In spite of the disadvantages, I would strongly recommend students and the public to visit the new Acapulco resort buildings and have a great experience learning about the buildings' history and at the same time travelling around Mexico.
I am sorry to hear that Mr.
Brown is ill.
I hope it isn't serious.
However, I will be glad to give you as much information as you need and I hope you will find it helpful.
The name of the hotel in which the group is going to stay is the Palace Hotel.
To get there you must go to the centre of town.
All the buses go there.
Once you are in the centre, the Palace Hotel is right in front of the tourism information office.
For the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us with live music and catering.
Due the hotel being such an elegant place I would suggest dressing up in evening dress.
Finally, to fill your free afternoon I would definitely recommend visiting the cathedral and having a walk around the old part of the city.
If you want, it will be my pleasure to show you the area.
Chairs are not only part of the furniture, they are also objects of and you can even find some in museums where they are art objects.
The world is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable .
From my point of view the chair is without a doubt the most useful gadget ever invented.
Some people use them in their work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the .
Although it is worth saying that not everybody can his ideal chair there is a special one for each of us.
Thank you for your letter.
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the conference.
I phoned the tourist information office last week and I got some information about the accommodation for the students.
I think we should book the Palace Hotel.
It is an outstanding building situated in the city centre.
The hotel is in a good position, 10 minutes' walk from the conference, and I think the best way to reach it is on foot.
I think they should wear smart clothes, because there will be lots of interesting people and it is an important meeting.
In conclusion, for the last day, I thought it would be very interesting for the students to visit the town and admire its monuments and art.
On the other hand, if you prefer to have a relaxing day, you could have a picnic in the wonderful park.
I hope my suggestion and ideas will help you to organise the meeting.
As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the suitability for a group of American students of the visit to the Etruscan Museum.
The museum is situated in the centre of Populoniou, the picturesque fishing village on the Etruscan Coast.
Populoniou is about 15 Km.
from Piombino and it can be reached by a means of transport.
The Etruscan Museum is one of the most attractive buildings in my town.
It contains lots of and some remains from the Estruscans' necropolis.
The entrance fee is £7 for each student.
1.
The Museum is well organised for tourists.
There are some shops, a café and toilets.
Also there are some free headphones that explain the history of the museum.
2.
After their visit to the Museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago, and they could have a picnic on the beach.
1.
The negative aspect of the museum is that it is quite expensive for students.
Although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, I strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
I am writing to give you some information that you asked for in your letter, which I received this morning.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London.
Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities.
It is located in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference.
In my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line.
However you could take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you also have some free time.
Regarding the end-of-conference party, I would suggest wearing a dress for a woman and an elegant suit for a man, though it is not a formal do.
The party will finish quite late, so we've decided to provide a bus which will take you to the hotel safely.
Basically, during three hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
However, you could take a long walk along the river to take some essential photos.
As far as I know, the telephone was invented in the 19th century.
It affected our lives very quickly, although there are some different means of communication such as TV, for instance.
Since the Internet was introduced, many of us can't imagine life without it.
We have even been able to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for some time.
However, are you always happy when your personal phone rings? I wonder whether you have experienced some situations when you wouldn't have your mobile switched on.
This invention has changed my life completely.
Since I have been travelling around the world, being in touch with my family or friends without the Internet or my mobile phone.
In spite of having the opportunity of keeping in contact with friends at times when we are far away from home, we should know how to use it without disturbing others.
Thank you for your letter.
It will be pleasure to help you.
The following is some information about the International student conference.
The party will be in the Palace Hotel.
The Hotel is very close to the Town Hall.
From Park Square, just go straight.
You can see the sign for the hotel.
This is an International student party, so I suggest you wear traditional costume.
It looks nice and has .
You can inform all the students that they can take some traditional food to the party.
After the meal, you can play some games and prepare a prize for the winner.
At the end of the conference you can dance and sing together.
These are my suggestions for this party.
If you still have a problem, you can call me.
I heard that a group of American students has just arrived in our town.
I want to an interesting building for them to visit.
It is the main building of LUTON University in Park Square.
It is an academic building.
It includes a library, , rooms, a and a restaurant.
There is a very big library.
You can find any information from it that you want.
For the rest of the time, you can go to the IT suite to use the Internet.
If you feel hungry, you don't need to go out.
in the same building, you can find a restaurant.
I recommend visiting this building, because American students .
They can also talk with British students .
I think it will be interesting for American students.
I am writing with reference to your letter concerning the organization of an international student conference at Wimbledon Art College.
Below I provide some information you asked about.
First of all, I would like to give you more information about the name and location of the hotel.
The group has been booked into the "Maria Luisa" Hotel, which is situated in the centre of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village.
This hotel is the next building after the Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place.
Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is meant to be on Wimbledon Common - a nice piece of English countryside.
So, it may be a good idea to wear very comfortable and informal clothes.
Thirdly, talking about your free afternoon before leaving the area, I would suggest you visit the Wimbledon Museum of Tennis.
There is quite a good exhibition there, giving interesting information about the history of Wimbledon Tennis Tournaments.
I look forward to meeting your group at our conference.
The purpose of this report is to give a brief description of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg.
In my opinion this building is the best place to visit.
This building is situated on the magnificent bank of the Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum.
The building was built by a very famous Russian architect and is a marvellous example of Russian classic architecture of the XVIII century.
In the Academy of Art you can find the oldest art library, with a wide range of books, and the Museum of Russian Art, with a huge collection of paintings, sculpture and architectural projects from the early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries.
It is also a good opportunity to be introduced to the Russian system of art education.
The building of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting because of its historic and educational aspects.
Your group has been booked into The Palace Hotel, located on the high street, opposite the post office.
The conference will be held in The Royal Hall, and the best way to get there from the hotel is by bus.
Take the 67 route and it will take you just in front of The Royal Hall.
About what you can do in the area in the free time you have, I would suggest you visit the Modern Art Museum which now has a new exhibition.
Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through Spring Gardens, which are beautiful at this time of the year.
The telephone: a great invention.
Imagine your life without a telephone.
Yes, I know, it is very hard to imagine our lives without this invention.
Think about the people living at the time it was invented.
It must have been such an exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles away........
and now for us it is just as simple as dialling a number and talking to whoever we want to.
Of course it is nice to have a phone conversation with friends or family, but the telephone is also very important for business and emergencies.
What about emergencies? A phone call in time for an ambulance can save the lives of many people having a heart attack.
I am one of the students and I am going to give you some information, all you need.
We have booked the hotel for you and the name of the hotel is the "Palace Hotel", it is quite near the shopping centre.
It is not far away.
You just go along Park Road for about ten minutes.
Then you will arrive at the Palace Hotel, which is on the left-hand side .
Regarding the end-of-conference party, we are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to take you to the Hotel.
You need to wear an evening dress or suit and bow tie.
Finally, on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now.
It is up to you.
I am the student leader.
We are pleased that your group has arrived so I am going to give you information about an interesting building to visit.
We recommend you go to the BBC building.
First of all, the BBC building is the news building of England.
On the ground floor, they have video cameras everywhere around the building and police officers walk around the building as well.
On the first floor, they have a huge radio room, for sending and receiving information from all over the world, because they have small BBC buildings all over the world also; for Example, THAILAND, the United States of America, INDONESIA and CANADA.
And the second floor is the newsroom where they go on air on the T.V.
That is not everything.
I have just given you a little information but they have more interesting things you do not know about.
I recommend this building because this building is the of London and this building is the second most beautiful building in London so that is why I recommend this building.
From the student leader.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I will be very pleased if I can help you with all your enquiries.
The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel.
It is fairly easy to get there from the conference.
I would suggest you walk along New Street, which is the one next to the river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel on your right-hand side.
The hotel is just opposite the City Hospital.
As you possibly already know, the end-of-conference party will take place in the main reception room at the same hotel.
You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening.
To answer your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes.
However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all.
Without any doubt the invention that has affected my own life the most is the car.
Cars have definitely changed all our lives, and I am not only in a positive way, but in a negative way as well.
Picture this: a big city such as London or New York with no cars on their streets.
Can you imagine it? To be honest, I can't.
Cars are part of our daily lives.
Traffic jams make people irritable, and sometimes really upset and violent.
But people use cars, anyway.
If we don't use them we suffer because of them.
In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car.
I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and other four-wheel motor vehicles.
Isn't that ironic? To go to the countryside and be able to breathe fresh, unpolluted air, I use my car, which, in my opinion, does not help to maintain a clean atmosphere at all.
Therefore I am thinking of selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places, and changed my life for a new life: without a car.
I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference at our college.
I would like to inform you that your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel.
It is situated in the centre of our town and it takes five minutes to get to the college, where the conference is going to be held.
I think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus.
The bus stop where you should get off is called "The Green Man".
With reference to the end-of-conference party, which is going to take place on Tuesday from 8:00 until midnight, I would like to mention the necessary dress code.
It is evening dress for women and black trousers, a white shirt and a black bow tie for men.
Lastly, I would like to give you some suggestions about ways in which you can spend your free time in our town.
I am strongly convinced that you should visit the local Science Museum.
Also there is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.
I look forward to seeing you at the conference and hope that you will have a good time in our town.
As is widely known, lots of different and important things were invented during the 20th century, nevertheless I believe that the most important one is the computer.
It is a fact that modern society has created the demand for an to cope with vast amounts of information.
Taking that into consideration I would like to say that the computer is a priceless invention for accountants, designers, engineers and so on .
Another advantage is their ability to connect to the Internet.
It allows you to have all the necessary information "at your fingertips".
Also is the role of computers in the process of production in factories around the world.
On the other hand there are some disadvantages.
For instance a lot of children nowadays replace their real life with a virtual world which computers create.
Another drawback is that in industry computers replace people's labour, which leads to increasing unemployment.
To conclude I would like to say that the governments of all developed countries wouldn't have been so concerned about the so-called "problem 2000" if the computer had not been so important for modern society.
I have just received your letter.
It was very sad news about Richard Brown.
I have given a lot of information about the international student conference.
Firstly, the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus.
Number 45 bus goes there every 5 minutes.
It takes 25 minutes, which is convenient for us.
Secondly, there are some items on the programme that are great.
First of all, the conference's head makes a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks.
Finally we enjoy a disco party so you should wear a suitable dress.
Alice knew that it was going to be a very special day for her.
Alice and Jane came back home.
Alice is Jane's boyfriend.
In the morning they met and then they went to the beach.
It was nice weather and they had a beautiful time.
In the evening they were going to the disco party that was Jane's friend's birthday party.
Jane explained that situation and they understood her.
So they could go to the disco party.
It was a very wonderful party and they have never forgotten that day.
It was a very very special day.
I am writing to give you the information that you asked me for.
The group has been booked into the Harris hotel.
This hotel is very well placed.
From there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference centre, and also you can go by underground to get there.
The conference starts at 5:30 pm and it finishes at 8:00 pm.
Then, after the Conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, which starts at 9:00 pm and finishes at 12:00 midnight.
This party is a formal one, so you should not be casually dressed.
In this area you can visit the central park.
It is very beautiful and a very good place to relax.
Another place that would be interesting to visit is the old cathedral of the city.
I hope this information will be useful for you.
Hampton Court Palace is located in Hampton Court.
I think this town is wonderful and it has a magical beauty.
To get to Hampton Court Palace, you need to take a train from Waterloo train station.
From there, the trains to Hampton Court depart.
Moreover, I think going by train is the best way to get there, because Hampton Court train station is very close to Hampton Court Palace.
There is a price for children, students, adults and families.
Tickets are between three and six pounds each.
Hampton Court Palace is a building with lots of history and interesting things to see.
And also this would be an excellent chance for this group of American students to see it.
We have booked the hotel for the group.
It is the "Palace Hotel", which is about 10 miles away from our College.
The hotel will have a coach to pick the group up from the airport on the 19th of June and then take the group to the Conference and return to the hotel every day.
Regarding the end-of-conference party, we have planned a barbecue for 5 oo pm on our most idyllic playing field, which overlooks the endless Countryside and farms.
At 7:00pm we can move to our student hall to until 10:00pm.
For the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel.
Then we all set off to go on a sightseeing tour of Bromley town centre for about two hours before you leave for the airport.
Bromley town centre is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London.
There are many historic buildings .
I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing tour.
If , please let me know.
We need light every day, not just at nighttime.
We need in offices and schools and other places during the daytime.
How wonderful life is since the invention of electric light.
Here we are just talking about apart from natural light.
When I was small, we lived in .
I remember, we used to have oil lamps which to give us light during the night.
It gave very little light , and there were many things we couldn't do in the light from the oil lamps because the light .
There was not any light outside our house, and no light on the road or field either.
I was always very scared or wherever I was, because most places.
This scary dark is still affecting my life now.
I never stay out after dark today except my family.
What a big person Einstein was, who invented light.
He created another day after sunset.
People use it to do anything they want to do.
We believe we can't live without light today, especially in the city .
We have a long time to spend on our activities after the Sun goes to bed.
We definitely need light to .
I dare say, without light, our life would go into a dark, dark hell.
I am writing to you to answer your question about the conference in London.
Thank you for your letter.
I am very pleased to know you decided to come to the "Second International Conference on Human Rights" which will be held at Albert Hall College on 25 June.
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to has been booked into the Palace Hotel in the centre of London from the 24th of June until the 25th of June.
The Albert Hall College, the building where the conference will be held is situated near Green Park Avenue.
To get to it from the Palace Hotel, you can take the number 26 bus, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton station to Green Park station.
It takes about 10 minutes , that's the quickest means of transport you can choose.
The Conference will start at 9 am on 25 June and will finish about 6 pm on the same day.
During the day you are supposed to have a break of half an hour at 12 noon and finally, there will be a party for all the people who will be there.
That will be a formal party and because of this, you will be required to be smartly dressed.
Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlemen a dark suit.
As I can see from your letter, you will have about three hours before you catch your plane, so, I would suggest you visit the Tate Modern Museum, where you will find several interesting pictures such as Dalis and Warhols.
If you need some more information or details about the conference, you can contact Alexia on 0033*** .
The aim of this report is to give some suggestions to a group of American students who have just arrived in Rome and want some information about an interesting building to visit.
1) "Fontana di Trevi" sited in Trevis Square in the centre of Rome.
That's a small square where there is a very big fountain.
It was built by the architect Canovas in 1638.
That is the fountain in which the film "Dolce Vita" took place.
2) On the other hand, there is the Villa Borghese building.
That is a museum where they can find the most important sculptures and pictures of Antonio Canovas and, Bernini, who lived for a long time in Rome.
1) First of all, they are located in the centre of Rome so they can take a bus to get to them .
2) Secondly, they can enjoy visiting museums, and afterwards they can have something to eat or to drink in the "pizzerias' and restaurants near these famous places.
In conclusion, they could combine art, history and nightlife by visiting only one place and without spending much money.
I am sorry to hear that our friend Mr Brown is ill.
As our conference is due to start next week I will respond straight away.
There is some information you have asked me about.
We booked rooms for your group at the Palace Hotel.
That is the best option because it is situated less than 5 minutes' walk from the conference centre.
When you leave the hotel you have to turn right and you the street.
At the first traffic lights turn right again and you should see a big blue building.
That's our conference centre.
At the hotel reception you will find printed information about how to get there.
As you know at the end of the conference there is a party.
The party is due to start at 8 p.m.
and will last until 3 a.m.
There is a 2hr break between the end of the conference and the party.
At this time you and your group can refresh yourselves.
I would like to mention that because our conference .
I hope you will enjoy it.
We prepared some special attractions, like live dance music and a hot and cold buffet.
Regarding your last question I can suggest visiting the Royal Castle.
That will give you and your guests an about our country and history.
In our town there are so many interesting places to see that it is hard to choose one.
In my opinion the most interesting is the castle.
It is situated on a hill so it is very easy to see where it is.
Actually it is a whole complex, the Old and the New Castle, the cathedral and the very interesting underground part with its amazing crypts.
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgettable views of a white town.
After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle.
You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armour and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
After that I am sure you will be happy to find a few restaurants located at the New Castle .
I am sure that should be enough for a one-day trip.
For your information I can say that at this time we have a five-week festival and that night there will be a great display.
That should complete an amazing day.
I am writing this letter in reply to your letter which arrived yesterday.
I do welcome you and your group, and I am willing to help you by giving the information that you have asked me for.
Firstly, let me explain the route from the PALACE HOTEL, where your group will be staying, to the conference.
The hotel is located in the centre of Seoul, therefore there are many ways to get to the conference.
The easiest way to get there is to take the underground, which takes about 20 minutes.
The map will be given to you on the day of your arrival.
Finally, I would like to recommend the visit to a traditional Korean palace Kyong Bok for the last day's free time.
It must be a very interesting visit for the students who have never experienced an oriental atmosphere.
It is just 5 minutes walk from the hotel, and in front of the hotel gate, an airport bus will be waiting for you to take you to the airport after finishing the outing.
This report provides the information about Kyong Bok Palace, which is highly recommended for visitors from foreign countries to visit.
It highlights the background history and considers the interest of young people, and makes a final recommendation.
The kingdom Chosun has a history of 500 years and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century.
Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size.
As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the Japanese army, and now there remains only a part of the original palace.
There is a special monument to the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army.
The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tend to dislike historical visits, would be the various activities.
You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals.
Also there are performances which are held daily at the front gate of the palace.
It is out of the question not to visit Kyong Bok Palace unless you do not want to know about Korean history.
You will find many interesting points there, therefore, I urge you to visit the place, if you want to experience the tradition of Korea.
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about the international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions about what you and your students can do during your free time here.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the central area of the city, so it will not take you and your students too much time to get to the town hall where the conference is supposed to be held.
The easiest way to get there from your hotel is to take bus 461 or 176 (the bus stop is opposite the hotel) or we can hire a minibus for you but there is an extra charge for it.
There is a party on the last day of the conference.
Special awards will be given to the students whose reports are the best.
our nightclub so a lot of music, dancing and fun are provided.
Please note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11pm.
You can wear whatever you like for this kind of party.
Coming back to ideas and Suggestions, I've promised to give you a free afternoon before you catch your plane.
I would advise you to visit our zoo or to go for a picnic in a park before you go to the party.
Can you see how many inventions you are surrounded with in your life? Such simple and everyday things like a telephone, a car, a computer only seem to be normal and everyday for us as we use them every day.
A hundred years ago people couldn't even use an electric lamp, to say nothing of a car or computer.
These inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
Some people say that many important inventions in our life are not so good and useful as we have got used to thinking them.
First of all they talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create, and some other problems.
But in my opinion if people's inventions have a place in our lives they are then.
I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (I am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems.
The electric lamp was an important invention a hundred years ago (at that time it was like a revolution).
I think it wouldn't be possible for us to survive without electric light.
Because of shipbuilding developments people were able to make all those geographical discoveries, and  is an undeniable necessity in our life.
Because of everything I have said I am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages.
I have just read your letter and I am happy to help by giving you some further information.
In reply to your first question, for the time of the conference the students will be staying at the Palace Hotel, where the reservation has already been made.
It is situated near to our college, about five minutes' walk from the nearest tube station, which is South Wimbledon.
As you were informed, there will be a party for all participants of the conference, which will take place afterwards in the hotel restaurant.
Bearing in mind the fact that it will be a purely social occasion, I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event.
Finally, to answer your last question about the students' day out, I suggest visiting the local Lawn Tennis museums and the Wimbledon Tennis Courts as they are one of the best international tourist attractions.
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
I look forward to seeing you.
The aim of this report is to give a description and make a recommendation concerning the most interesting building in the town.
The place I would like to recommend is the seventeenth-century Royal Palace.
It is situated in the heart of Warsaw and surrounded by the buildings of the Old Town.
There is an old market square with the magnificent statue of King Zygmunt in the centre of it.
.
Inside the Palace, there is a museum with a collection of antique porcelain.
.
The Old Town is the best place for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, cafes and street performers.
.
Cashpoints, toilets, emergency services etc are within easy reach.
.
Admission to most places is absolutely free.
.
A part of the Palace might be closed, due to the ongoing renovations.
.
All the facilities are usually overcrowded during the summer holiday.
I am replying to your letter concerning the help you need.
I am pleased to provide the information you need for the group.
The hotel I booked is the Palace Hotel which is in the centre of London just two blocks from Victoria station.
I think it is very convenient for the group.
You know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city.
About the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service.
The rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value.
And the best way to get to the College for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to Glouster Road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the College.
However I am going to make a plan for each student with all of the details and the address.
About the party at the end of conference, we are organising it in the same hotel which has a nice .
It will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place.
We'll have food and drink and music for dancing.
It is not a formal party so I think it is fine to wear something not too formal.
I want to suggestions for the last day.
You and your group could maybe go to Green Park and visit the Queen's house and Parliament, this area is very nice and the group would after the conference to get some fresh air.
Another option could be the new Tell Gallery.
I have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
I have been hearing about the they have in the exhibition, it is interesting.
I hope you found this letter useful and if you have any questions, let me know.
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
The computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small hole and each hole meant something  like a code.
The machine that was used for reading this card was very big, you used to need a room for the computer.
I remember when I had the first lesson at the University and the teacher took us to the Computer Centre and I saw these machines, all my colleagues and I were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
But the computer has a bad side too.
each day we depend more and more on it.
So I feel scared when I think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens these days with sex or other .
I work with children and the computer helps me in my job but affects it too.
So I hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent these problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
Thank you for your letter.
I am writing to give you some advice about the international student conference.
First of all, the name of the hotel which we have been booked into is the Palace Hotel.
And we have two ways to get to the conference, a bus or a train.
Both of them are .
The day before we will leave , we have a party which takes place in our hotel.
It is a kind of formal party, so we should be well dressed.
I suggest that you wear formal dress.
There will be some finger food and drinks.
It might be a great party for the end of the conference.
, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
It's quite a nice area and a suitable place to spend three hours.
It could be interesting for them.
A telephone is used when we need to contact someone, and also in emergency situations and for the Internet.
It has various .
However, nowadays it is not only used for these purposes, but also it keeps us company.
If you feel lonely, you can talk and hear from your friends easily.
Then it makes you happy.
A long time ago people lived without this perfect invention.
But how? They used to keep in touch by letter.
, it was the only way.
So that's why they have invented the telephone.
I have received your letter and I'm pleased to answer your questions.
M.
Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel.
This is a first-class hotel.
The easiest way to get from the hotel to the conference is by bus.
There is a bus stop in front of your hotel.
Take the bus in the direction of the centre of town.
After four stops, get off the bus.
The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'.
When you get off the bus, the conference is in the building across the road.
You can't miss it.
Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go to a disco.
For the disco, you mustn't wear blue jeans.
Finally, on your last day, I suggest you do a sightseeing tour in our town.
It takes you two hours.
Afterwards you will have some time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland.
If you have any more questions, write back to me.
With the computer, our work is easier and more interesting.
Before the time of computers, people had to write a whole letter every time .
When they wanted to correct a word, they had to write the whole letter again.
With the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again.
We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
I work in a bank and I work all day with computers.
If we hadn't any , we would have to write all the transactions on paper.
If I order money for our bank with the computer, I can be sure that it will arrive the day after.
But if I had to write a letter and to send it by post, the money would arrive two or three days after.
I have never worked without a computer, but if we hadn't any, we would find it normal.
I'm pleased to be able to help you with the international student conference.
The hotel into which the group has been booked is the Palace Hotel, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc.
To get from the hotel to the conference, you have to take the highway in the direction of Lausanne, and after nearly half an hour of driving you come out at the place which is with Coppet, Divonne.
When you come out, just go right, and then turn left to follow the directions to the Châtaigneroie School.
During all mankind's history, there were who tried to make human life better, but it is in the last century that the biggest discoveries were made.
When the phone without a cable was invented, one wasn't sure if it would be a success or not.
But the research went on, and the mobile phone is always getting smaller and more useful.
The mobile phone is an important invention, because nearly everybody has one, and so one can always call somebody if there is a problem.
Moreover, some mobile phones have a connection to the Web, so it is easy to read the newspapers if one hasn't enough money to buy them.
Personally, the mobile phone has affected my own life, because when somebody is phoning me at home, I don't have to rush to get the phone, being afraid that .
I recommend this extremely important invention to those who still don't have a mobile phone.
I would be pleased to help you with all your questions and I will provide you with the information which you need as far as I can.
I would like to inform you that Centeral Red Lion Hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get everywhere on foot from the hotel during your stay.
As you know, we are arranging an evening party on the third day of the week, we can say that it is a kind of relaxation time.
Nothing will be .
The place is the college garden.
The time is 7 pm.
There is no need to bother about clothes.
Everybody can wear something casual.
Before you leave England, I suggest you visit the canals and small villages around Basingstoke.
You could have the opportunity to see the country life.
I have to admit that whoever invented cars and transportation vehicles came up with the most inventions of the world.
I say that they must be the most important things for us because they our time passing so fast.
Certainly it would be just like mine because I live in a rural area, far from any village, town, or city centre.
To reach the nearest civilization takes me 1 hour on foot.
I have no car, and no local bus service to use.
Even coming to Basingstoke seems like an international journey to me.
And of course this stops me .
But also I'm aware that time flies for me.
I must do whatever I want before it is too late.
And I have to confess the invention of the car was the most useful invention for humanity.
I was delighted to receive your letter and to know that a group of students from your college have decided to take part in our international student conference.
As you need more information, I will answer all your questions with pleasure.
Firstly, the Palace Hotel has been booked for your group.
It is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
Secondly, our end-of-conference party includes dinner and dancing.
I would advise you to wear something not very formal.
Finally, you can spend an afternoon on the last day visiting local historic places (castles built in the 13th century) or art galleries, as well as the beautiful Bodnant Garden.
I am looking forward to the meeting with you and our shared work during conference.
There are many different people's inventions around us.
We are so used to them that sometimes we think they always existed.
Some of them are very practical, others are rather strange.
I think that one of the most important inventions affecting our life is the telephone.
Imagine life without a phone.
You are on the road, you have a car accident.
What are you going to do without a phone? In another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently.
I am sure the phone has saved many lives.
Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only to chat .
Thanks to the phone, it is possible to speak to your mum even when she is at the other end of the Earth.
To be honest, the next greatest invention of mankind, the computer, can't work if you haven't got the phone.
So I am very grateful to the man who invented it.
Unfortunately, I have forgotten his name.
It always happens with people, doesn't it? Try asking who invented the wheel or the book.
it is with great regret that I hear of Mr Brown's illness, and I hope to see him soon in excellent health.
Nevertheless, I am both pleased and honoured to expect you and your group in the context of our international meeting.
We have made arrangements for you to stay at the Palace Hotel.
Furthermore, since it is located between the airport and our location, a shuttle bus has been organised to take all our guests from the hotel to the conference room.
The end-of-conference party is to be held in the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness.
Therefore, all the guests will be asked to wear the appropriate clothes in order to be .
As for the three hours of free time, I strongly suggest you check your luggage in at the airport and then, after a five-minute bus ride, spend your time in the marvellous 'Old City'.
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communications technology over the last few years.
The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our daily life is, of course, the mobile phone.
It is clear and irrefutable that the use of this invention has become a necessary in some professional activities.
.
However, the average man seems to ignore how important and useful a mobile phone becomes when in the hands of a high-school student.
I have just received the letter from you and I'm writing to you as soon as possible.
I can promise you that I'll do my best to help you.
You told me that you are the leader of a group of students this year, because Mr.
Brown is ill.
Poor Mr.
Brown.
I hope he will get better soon.
Nowadays is one of the most important inventions.
When you look around everybody has a car or motorcycle.
.
Let me to tell you how the invention of the motorcycle has affected my life.
I love motorcycles and I don't think I could live without them.
I have ridden a motorcycle since I was 16 years old.
Me and my brother used to go to rock concerts.
We met a lot of people there who were as mad about motorcycles as we were.
We organized races and trips.
We rode motorcycles for a few days before we finally got to our meeting points.
I really enjoy riding my motorcycle.
People say that it is dangerous; I don't think so.
When I ride it is only me and my motorcycle.
In front of me and behind are my friends, who I like and trust.
And around me is the countryside, which I can and enjoy while we look for a camp.
We can go to any place we like, avoiding traffic and crowded buses and trains, etc.
I am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world.
I feel very bad about the fact that I don't know who it was.
On the other hand because that invention has changed and affected my life and the people I care about; it has affected my life in the very best way.
Thank you very much for your letter.
, I am very happy to help you with the details of the conference.
The hotel that your group will be staying at is the Palace Hotel.
It is reasonably near to the college, so it may be very nice to walk from the hotel along the River Thames following the yellow signs on sunny days.
If it rains, you can take the 54 bus that stops in front of the college.
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a taste of many different cultures.
So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world.
As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear the national dress of her country.
Other members of the groups can wear normal, attractive formal dress.
On the last day, I recommend that you visit the place that is located at the centre of our city.
It is about 1000 years old, so I am sure that you will find it fascinating to see it.
If you think about how many computers we use every day and how dependent we are on them, it must be clear to you that the invention of computers has certainly had a significant impact on all our lives.
For example, all , such as public transport and power stations, are run using computers, the government uses them to organise all sorts of things in a country, and all kinds of institutions and businesses, such as hospitals and supermarkets, use them as essential .
In other words, almost all aspects of our lives today rely on computers.
.
From my personal experience, I can also say that a personal computer is also an amazing tool.
It improves the of my homework, which often involves essay writing, and also it allows me to access the Internet.
Since I live abroad, the Internet is really useful for me with my best friend and when I want to know what is going on in my home country.
To sum up, I can say that the greatest ever invention is the invention of computers, which has affected both individuals and society as a whole.
I am writing in reply to your enquiry about this year's international conference.
The conference will be held at The Palace Hotel on Old Street.
There will be signs to follow from the central train station.
The conference commences on 31st June 2001 from 10.00-15.00.
A light lunch will be provided.
After the conference, there will be a relaxing party.
There is no dress code for the party.
However, I suggest you wear the same outfit that you will wear for the conference.
I have included a local map.
There are some on the back of the map.
Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours.
We have arranged special discounts for the conference attendees.
Personally I recommend the Dickens tour because it is a good length walk and very historical.
I hope that I have covered all the information you will need and look forward to seeing you.
P.S.
Please find the map enclosed.
There are several interesting buildings in the city of London.
I believe Liverpool Street Station is at the top of the list.
The building itself looks grand and elegant.
Despite the fact that this building serves half a million commuters in a day, it is always clean and functional.
There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting a building.
The newly decorated section is fairly modern in style with escalators and touch-screen ticket machines.
It is also very well linked to the old underground station, which is such a contrast in .
The old bit is rather unique and charming.
You can really imagine what it looked like in the old days.
There is another surprising section in this building.
At the far side of the station it is connected to a spacious, well-designed public park.
It is a good example of great architecture that was designed to provide services for the public.
Finally, it is in the heart of the city and without doubt everyone will be able to find it.
Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001.
I hope I can give you the information you need, so the conference will be a great experience for you and your group.
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel.
The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station.
A free shuttle bus takes you to the conference centre.
The bus leaves at 8 a.m.
from the front entrance of the hotel.
The end-of-conference party is in a tent and in the grounds.
There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and much more.
It will be a surprise! I suggest that you wear leisure clothes for the party.
The last afternoon you could go on a city tour, visit the Museum of Fine Arts, or enjoy the beautiful flower garden next to the public park.
I hope I have been able to give you some ideas.
I look forward to seeing you.
How has the phone affected my own life? I think that is a good question to think about.
I could not call my friends from another city and just say "hello".
It would be difficult and would take more time to make an appointment.
So, what has the phone revolution done for us? It saves us time.
Thank you for your recent letter.
First, I would like to congratulate you on your new responsibility, because of Mr Brown's illness.
I will give you with great pleasure all the details needed.
Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly opposite the bus station.
To go to the conference from your hotel is really easy.
You have to take the number 1 bus and get off at "Black House", which is the third stop.
After the conference, at about 8 pm a party is being organised.
During it, everybody will have the opportunity to meet and talk to the speakers of the conference.
Food and beverages will be available.
After the cocktails, the Band "Zero one" will play their famous songs.
The clothes required for the party are suits for men and cocktail dresses for women.
Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to do a sightseeing tour of our city.
I hope you will enjoy your stay in our city and look forward to meeting you at this conference.
In order to write this report, I spent hours in this wonderful museum.
There, I saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself.
I walked around the garden too.
The museum is located in Ouchy, opposite the "Delamuraz Hotel".
It is close to the main road, and 300 metres from the station.
The building is made of white stones.
It has two floors.
Before going inside, you have to pass through the huge garden.
There, ponds, pools, trees, flowers and ducks can be admired.
I recommend you to take your swimsuit, because in summer, it is allowed to swim in the pools.
When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls.
They were all painted during the war by nurses.
If you go down a few steps, you will discover the cellar.
Everything in this room is connected with wine.
The only negative point is that you have to pay 10 francs to visit the house and the garden.
Firstly, the Palace Hotel is waiting for you and your students.
The best way to get from there to the college where the conference will take place is simply to walk.
Actually, the college is situated 500 metres from the hotel.
As you know, the conference will be followed by a party.
It will begin at 7 p.m.
and last until late in the evening.
You don't need to worry about what you should wear to this event.
In fact, the purpose of the end-of-conference party is to relax after a busy day.
Therefore you and your students can put jeans and sport shoes on.
I hope the international student conference will help everyone to get to know each other better and that it will be a success.
The Olympic Museum dates from the 19th century and is the biggest in Europe.
It shows all the different sports men have been doing since the first Olympic Games in Greece.
You can see the evolution of sports and understand why changes gradually have been made to improve them.
You can admire every kind of equipment you need to do any particular sport.
You will be informed about the history of sport in general and about the new technologies which are used nowadays in competitions.
The museum is near the city centre and is accessible by bus or walking.
It will take you an afternoon to visit it and then you can enjoy a drink or a meal in the restaurant on the third floor, which is well known for being one of the best establishments in Lausanne.
I hope my recommendations will help you a building to visit.
First of all, your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, 21 Main Road, which is situated not far from our college.
I'd suggest you walk.
It will only take you about seven minutes.
Just follow Main Road until you reach a junction, where you turn right and then walk along Denl-a-Lion Road.
The college is a huge, yellow building - you can't miss it.
Secondly, you have requested information about the end-of-conference party.
It will begin at 6 o'clock p.m.
and last until midnight.
All the students will be provided with sacks and we have managed to book a band as well.
The location of the party isn't fixed yet, but we will let you know after your arrival.
There is no need to put on special clothes for the party.
Casual dress should do just as well, because we want everyone to feel comfortable.
Who of you could imagine life without the telephone? Not being able to call your friend and ask if you can pop over for a moment? Not being able to lie to your mother-in-law and pretend you can't attend her garden party because of an illness, without having to look her in the eye? When Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone, he had no idea how popular it would be one day.
Its first application was to listen to a concert if you were not able to attend it in person.
Nowadays, however, the whole world is connected by a telephone system and no one can imagine life without it.
I would like to thank you for your letter.
I am sorry to learn that Richard Brown cannot attend the conference.
Please give him my best wishes for his recovery.
We have booked rooms for all members of your group at the Palace Hotel.
It is a very cosy building that is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximately one mile away.
There is a direct bus link between the two locations: this is the number six bus line; the bus stop for the conference building is called "Avenue de cour" and the one at the Palace Hotel is named "Main station".
Concerning the party, we do not have a casual dress code.
Students usually wear dark clothes, with a tie for the boys and a medium-length skirt or dress for the girls.
There are a lot of activities you can do during your free afternoon.
I would like to suggest visiting the "Ethnographic Museum" which is unique in the world.
I think that the car is one of the human inventions that has most affected the way of life of people from industrial countries.
Nowadays of world industry is related to the automotive business: car manufacturing, oil extraction and refining, tyre recycling, and so on.
The industrial countries have encountered great change in their structures since the car has been made available to everyone.
At the beginning of the last century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was a kind of leisure or sport to drive one.
Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities.
The transport network has changed in accordance with this social evolution.
The increasing number of is now creating problems.
A lot of roads and motorways are overcrowded, and environmental problems are more and more related to the intensive use of cars and lorries.
People and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting their mobility.
My name is Juniper.
I am helping to organise the conference in the college.
I received your letter the other day and I am writing to answer your questions.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is not very far from the place where the conference will be held.
You can take the No.41 bus from the hotel to the conference.
It only takes ten minutes approximately.
As for the end-of-conference party, it will be on the morning of the last day, starting at 9:00.
All the students and staff will attend together in the hall.
They can play games and talk about their personal experiences.
The main aim of this is to strengthen the friendship among all these pupils coming from all over the world.
So it would be fine if you wore casual clothes and looked smart.
I have made arrangements for the afternoon on the last day for you.
If you are free I will show you around our college.
You can visit our newly built science lab as well.
I'm sure you would acquire a lot of knowledge there.
Welcome to London.
You asked me about an interesting building to visit.
, I recommend the British Museum.
One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there.
The hotel your group has been booked into is called the Palace Hotel.
It is simple to find your way from this hotel to the conference.
You only need to cross the street in front of your hotel.
There you will find a modern building with two different doors, a red one and a blue one.
You are asked to go through the blue door.
After entering, you will see the conference room which will be signposted.
We have organized an end-of-conference party on the day before your departure.
Everyone is welcome to join in with this party in order to get to know each other in a good atmosphere.
You should wear nice comfortable clothes.
This is an informal party.
I suggest you visit the old part of Zurich or go to the zoo before your departure.
I am looking forward to meeting you at the conference.
If there are any more questions, please contact me.
I love baking cakes, cookies and breads.
Baking is my passion and in the town where I live I'm known for making the best cakes in the area.
It doesn't matter what kind of mood I am in, I can do it all the time and it makes me feel good.
I think the oven is one of the most important inventions.
If there is someone who doesn't agree with me, he or she should try to live for one month without using an oven.
In addition to that, he or she should look carefully into what he or she buys.
I'm positive that after such an experience everyone would say that the oven is a really important invention for our lives.
I am writing in reply to your letter.
I am sorry about Richard Brown.
And I understand that you need help, so I will help you as far as I can.
Firstly, the hotel which has been booked for you is Palace Hotel which is located close to the conference.
In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will provide.
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference.
The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes.
You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well.
Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals.
As you may have heard, our city is well known for the musicals.
Or, if you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated at ten minutes' distance on foot from the hotel.
Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice.
If you have more questions about the conference or anything else, do not hesitate to ask me.
I would be glad to be able to help you.
Some inventions are not regarded as great things even though life without them cannot be imagined.
People do not , because they have been getting more popular and common.
However, there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extremely important invention.
This is electricity, invented by Edison.
In my opinion, the reason why electricity is such an important invention is that most machines, appliances and equipment which are used in modern times can only be operated with electricity, which makes people not do too much physical labour.
What is more, many inventions have been accelerated by electricity.
In my life, I use electricity in many different ways.
At night, I can study because of it.
And it also saves my time which would be used up doing housework such as laundry, cleaning rooms and ironing.
It makes my life more convenient than it would be without it.
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference.
I hope that our friend Richard Brown doesn't have any serious illnesses.
, where is the conference? This will be in the Casino Hotel and we don't need to worry about the best way to get there because all the main routes in Devonport have signs that show the correct way to this popular hotel.
After the conference, there is a party in the same hotel.
At this party, there will be some food, soft drinks, music and a special place for dancing.
This party is for the students so the clothes won't be so formal.
On the free day before catching our plane, we can choose between two options our free time.
One is a guided tour of the city centre, and another is visiting the chocolate factory.
Please, if you have any more questions, please call me on 38755980.
It's true.
.
Some people can live without this, but I am sure that the world would be very different.
When we use different equipment in our homes, we are using electricity.
.
Now, you just need to think .
Finally, I think that everybody knows that electricity is a very important invention and for me it is the best.
Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry about not giving you enough information.
We have already booked a 4-star hotel - the Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames.
It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train.
The end-of-conference party will be held in an Indian restaurant, which is next to the hotel.
It is supposed to be from 7 pm to 11 pm.
Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and a disco is also provided.
You can wear anything you like.
We would like you just to be yourself and have fun.
As you know, our area is quite famous and lots of people come and visit it every year.
There are so many things to do.
Unfortunately, there are just 3 hours.
I recommend the high street in the centre of our area because it is quite good for shopping.
So you can buy gifts for your friends or families.
I hope I have given you enough information and if you still have some questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Nowadays, our lives are becoming better and better.
Lots of great inventions have been invented in order to help people live comfortably.
If you ask me which is the greatest invention of all, I will say that it is the television.
"Television is just an amazing invention." My good friend said that.
I agree with her.
Firstly, televisions let us know more about the world without travelling .
If there were no televisions, we wouldn't know what the other countries were like, or even what language they speak, unless we went to that country.
Secondly, in some ways, it can educate young children.
Many TV programmes are specially made for children, such as "Learn Follow Me" and "Be Good to Others".
Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me learn what I should do generally or how to behave well when I was still a child.
Last but not least, it is a good kind of entertainment.
Maybe you think that playing basketball and going to cinemas and discos are much better than staying at home sitting in front of an object.
However, televisions can bring you the fun that other activities can't.
If sometimes I don't want to go out and I don't want to be lonely, it's easy, I just turn on the television and enjoy myself.
However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages.
Personally, I do think televisions are the most important invention.
, he booked the Palace Hotel in the downtown area.
When you go to the conference, you can take a bus or a taxi.
But if you have enough time, I would like to recommend walking because there are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea.
And also it takes just fifteen minutes.
I think everybody can enjoy it.
By the way, the end-of-conference party is a kind of farewell party.
There will be three parts.
The first part, the chairman and a few guests will give a speech and the second part, the participants will evaluate themselves, and the last part will consist of dinner and drinks.
It will not be too formal a party.
So you can wear what you like.
Moreover, I would like to recommend a 'City tour' for three hours.
Everybody will enjoy themselves.
It is £12 each and there is a reduction for groups.
I hope it will be a good tip for you and if you have any problem, you can contact me anytime.
And have a nice time in my town and send my regards to Richard.
Nowadays there are a lot of inventions around the world, and they make us more comfortable and our lives more convenient.
Moreover we cannot live without them.
For example: electricity, the computer, telephone, boat, and car (wheel), etc.
None of them are unimportant for us.
But I think the invention of electricity is the most important thing among them.
If you look around at home, there are a lot of electric things.
Electricity made us able to invent other things.
It also gave us more free time, especially for women.
It has absolutely reduced women's housework time.
We can enjoy our night even more with lights.
If we want to do something, we can do it at night the same as in the day.
Thank you for your letter about the international student conference.
Here are the answers to your questions.
You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated opposite the railway station, Camberley.
To get to the conference, you catch the No.7 coach from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop.
It takes 5 minutes from the station.
When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held.
The end-of-conference party will be held in the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium.
It starts at 6 p.m.
and ends at 10 pm.
We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign countries will prepare their ethnic foods.
There is a museum next to the Camberley Station, which has a good collection of paintings and pottery, and it would be a good place for you to spend your free time.
Also, there are a lot of shops around there.
You can buy souvenirs.
This castle is situated in the centre of the town and surrounded by woods.
The inside of the castle is always dark, even in the daytime.
It is 500 years old, and it is said to be haunted by a lady ghost.
She appears occasionally and opens every window in the castle.
It is believed that she was a nanny who worked there and fell out of the window.
People said she was seeking something and is still seeking it even though she has been dead for 500 years.
The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture from the 16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful.
I think it is worthwhile seeing it.
I hope you'll enjoy going there.
I received your letter this morning.
I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attend the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group.
I hope that the information below is very useful to you, during your attendance at the conference.
I have booked a hotel not far from our school.
The hotel is called the Epsom Down Hotel.
Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00.
There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk.
You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00.
You will then have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage.
The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you leave the hotel by 12:00.
The best way to get to the conference is to follow the college road and turn left toward the end.
You then keep going straight.
You will eventually see the main entrance to the college.
When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then.
They all know where the conference is and when.
At the end of the conference, we will have a party.
The party is to let all the students get to know each other better.
The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room.
I would suggest they wear formal clothing, such as tie, trousers and blazer.
For the afternoon free time on the last day, there are a wide variety of choices in the things that they can do.
They can play tennis, do athletics, swim...
and many other sports activities in our school, if they want to.
Or they can also visit Epsom Town.
There are shops which sell clothes, food, and books ...
They can decide what they want to do.
It's entirely up to them.
I am looking forward to seeing you and hope you have a safe flight over to England.
Welcome to Taiwan.
This report is on an interesting building, where you can take your students .
This building is situated in Taipei, the capital.
The building is called the Chiang Kei-shek Memorial Hall.
Nearly everyone knows where this building is, so if you have a chance, just ask the local people in Taipei about this building.
The Memorial Hall is surrounded by large playgrounds.
As you go into the main Hall, you will see a huge statue of Chiang Kei-shek.
This is because the building is the of how .
The statue is about 20 feet high.
The statue is protected by guards.
The guards will change every four hours.
Apart from the main Hall, there are also lots of other galleries.
In these galleries there are paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used.
These treasures are very old, even older than the history of America.
All these treasures were brought over to Taiwan by Chiang China.
They are all being well looked after.
As well as all the treasures, statues and paintings...there are also restaurants and modern galleries.
When you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with things, you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern.
I have received your letter dated the 12th of June 2001.
I am very happy to help you and I hope that the information that I am going to give you will be satisfactory.
The international student conference will be in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne.
The hotel is a big building in the middle of the town near the square, "St-François".
And the name of the street is "Grand-Chêne".
You cannot miss it.
After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead of staying in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be served for us.
Afterwards, a live band is going to play for the rest of the night.
Regarding the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic.
If you want to stay in Lausanne during your free afternoon, the best thing to do is to go to Ouchy.
There, you can enjoy the landscape and sunbathe.
The aim of this report is to give you further information on an interesting building to visit in Lausanne.
It is based on my own experience.
The Olympic Museum is situated near the lake and offers, for the tourist, an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake.
But also the museum has a lot of gardens with several statues.
Also, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern.
First of all, the main interest of the museum is Olympic history.
You can find a lot of documents about it and you have several .
In addition, you can play several interactive games and learn about the rules of the Olympic games.
REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATION.
The principal reason is the cheap price.
You pay only for entry and you can stay all the time that you want.
On the other hand, if there are more than 10 people, you can pay a group price and pay only 6 Frs per person.
It seems that this option might be the best way to visit this museum.
To sum up, the Olympic Museum is a very attractive place and could be a good trip with your family or your student group.
Therefore, if you want to learn something about the Olympic Games, it must be the best place for you.
I'm so happy to help you with this international student conference.
I'm sorry to hear about Richard.
Could you please give him my best wishes for his health? I'm sure that you can perfectly replace him to lead your group.
First, you should know that you are booked into the Palace Hotel, that is one of the best in the town.
The access to the conference place is very easy.
First of all, you must walk down  Central Street until you arrive at the bus stop, then you take the number two bus that goes directly to the college.
After the conference, there is a great party that is being organised by friends.
It starts at eight o'clock until the end of the night, so be prepared! There is no special dress code but it would be more fun if you wear something crazy...
I will give you some information on Yverdon's castle.
This building is one of the oldest that is in the of the town.
I think it's important to see it when you come here because it shows us how the town has been developed around it since its creation.
These days, the castle is being , so there is a lot of construction machinery around it.
That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum inside it where you can see old pictures of the castle over the centuries.
There are a lot of old items that were in the King's family.
You would have probably heard about the mummy who has slept there for about two thousand years...
You can see it in the dungeon.
So you can visit everywhere you want with or without a guide.
I hope you will enjoy the visit and I wish you a nice holiday in Yverdon.
First of all, we have already booked the Five-Star Hotel for your group.
It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenient for the airport.
You can take either bus or taxies.
The number 101 bus leaves from the airport, then you can get off at the "city college" stop.
It would be a great chance for everyone to attend the party.
This is just a relaxing party, just so the members have a chance to relax and make friends.
So I think you'd better wear a dress.
Finally, about the three free hours, my personal preference is to go shopping.
Our city has got the biggest shopping centre in South England.
There are so many shops.
It is worth spending time and money on that.
Nowadays people have become used to watching television programmes every day.
The TV is so important that you can see one in every home, and it is an essential item for everyone.
First of all, in my opinion, TV has a great educational function, and it also makes the world smaller.
You can just sit at home and you can know what is happening all over the world at that moment.
I would rather watch the news on TV instead of reading a newspaper or listening to the radio because the news on TV is .
However, TV also has some disadvantages.
You might just sit in front of the TV for hours learning nothing, or no longer talk with your family.
I think this is the worst influence in society.
In conclusion, TV has both advantages and disadvantages, but on the whole the advantages are greater than the disadvantages.
So on the whole, TV still is a wonderful and important invention .
I am writing to you to give you more information about the international student conference.
The group has been booked into the King Hotel on High Street, which is very easy to find.
And the best way to get from there to the conference is by following the road in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side.
After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference venue, which is called the White House.
At the end of the conference, we are going to have an International Dinner as well as some shows from the students in my college.
As this is a special conference you could wear your own national dress to represent your country.
Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time visiting our town hall where you will be able to learn more about my area - or you could do some shopping on High Street.
I am writing to give information on a very interesting building .
It is called Penrhyh Castle, and this building will tell you all about Wales.
On the positive side, you and the group will be able to learn more about Welsh artworks .
The building itself looks splendid and beautiful.
On the other hand, .
And some old toilets might look awful.
But in my opinion it would be nice for the students to come and see this building, because they will be able to learn and compare the place with their country.
As Wales is not modern like America, the students will probably get an interest in looking at old things.
I was really pleased to receive your letter.
Unfortunately Richard Brown is ill but I can help you as much as I can.
So, I'm writing to reply to give all the information you asked for.
Firstly, we've booked Palace Hotel, which is located in Central.
The best way to get from the hotel to the conference is using the tube because it takes only 20 minutes.
The tube is line 2 which is red .
And your speech would be better for the end of conference party.
I'd suggest you wear at least, semi-formal clothes such as a jacket with other clothes.
Finally, I give you some suggestions in the national museum in my area.
The museum can be helpful to understand our country's history and art.
The computer is the most important invention in our life.
Some people might say electricity is more important than any other thing.
It's hard to say which is the most important invention.
However, I'd say the computer is a more amazing invention rather than other inventions such as the telephone, the car.
Recently the computer has become really necessary and we can't manage to work without them.
Not only for bussiness, but also in my life.
For instance, when I want to contact  my friend, it's quite helpful to use e-mail.
Before the computer had been invented, we couldn't possibly have lots of information easily and we couldn't contact  foreign countries at the same time.
And also it's time to make new systems which makes use easier and more simple, so far more people can enjoy computers than before.
Despite Being an amazing invention, sometimes the computer causes a big problem, such as the millennium bug (some people called it the "2000 problem"), because computers are not flexible enough like a human's brain.
However, the computer is worth using in our life until a more convenient machine is invented.
As you know, we've been working very hard all this term.
So we've decided at the end-of-conference party we will have a buffet and a disco party.
Our students then will get to know each other well.
I would suggest everybody wear casual dress.
Finally, I would recommend you and your group try shopping and sightseeing around Oxford Street and nearby.
I look forward to seeing you and your group soon.
As you asked which is the most interesting building to visit, I would strongly recommend the Barbican Centre building in the city.
It is located in the city and the nearest tube station is Moorgate Station.
The Barbican Centre was built in 1975.
Apart from Banks and important offices, there are also the world stock-market exchange, an opera theatre, shopping arcades, and book and record stores.
It also holds an international exhibition all year round.
Recently, the African exhibition just finished.
It is open from 7.30 AM.
till late at night when the theatre closes.
The building is huge with modern technology and construction and tight security.
every year.
The Barbican Centre is a very important building in London.
You and your group will visit one building which has very many in this building.
So you can .
Thank you for your letter which arrived this morning.
Of course it is a pity that Mr.
Brown has been ill, but we are happy that you are coming now.
You asked me which hotel the group had been booked into.
It is the Palace Hotel, about a mile away from where the conference will take place.
The best way to get there is to take the number 7 bus.
The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel.
You will get off the bus at "Royal Gardens".
Turn left and go straight along "Baker Street".
At the end of this street there is a house, number 18.
This is our college.
You wish to know all about the end-of-conference party.
As far as I can see, there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will us with their songs.
Moreover you asked what to wear.
Do not worry.
I would recommend you wear some casual clothes, like jeans, a blouse or a skirt and a jacket.
Do not forget to wear a pair of comfortable shoes, because you will not have the chance to change them.
Finally I will give you some advice about what you could do for about three hours.
Firstly, we have a nice interesting museum, it is located near the hotel.
Also, there is the zoo with a lot of different animals, located within five minutes' walk.
Lastly, there is also a very old and famous church, with many coloured windows.
For further information, please call me .
I hope you will have an interesting conference here.
In my early childhood my mother said to me that when she was a little girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived.
It was in her parents' apartment.
The neighbours came to make their calls and to get their calls.
Today nobody could imagine such a situation.
In every household there is one telephone at least.
There are a lot of advantages to it.
Another advantage is that all offices, firms and industries could not exist without it.
All people know this situation: people want not to be interrupted, maybe they are reading a book, having a good talk or are having a little sleep...
then the telephone rings...! It is not an easy decision how to react now.
Being sincere, most of us would go to the telephone.
Another point of disadvantage is that mobile phones are ringing everywhere and all the time.
Especially youngsters misuse this kind of invention.
To sum up, this invention is one of the most useful things.
It is always the same how people use it or not and how people handle it.
thank you for your letter, which arrived yesterday.
I hope to give you all the information you need and, please, if you want more information or something is not clear, please don't hesitate to contact me again.
The hotel is near the station and is called "Grand Placad".
When you arrive you take the train to Guildford and after that you just have to cross the road in front of the station.
It's a very comfortable hotel where you can find everything you need.
From there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre.
The conference is held in the civic hall so it is very easy to find it.
At the end of the conference there is a party, a perfect opportunity for your students to make new friends from all parts of the world and they can talk about their experience.
For this conference I suggest wearing something very comfortable but elegant.
The organisation wants all the men to wear a jacket, but a tie is not necessary.
I don't really know what you should see; I don't think three hours is enough but near the station there is a beautiful park, popular for its variety of flowers.
If I find something special you will be able to visit in three hours I will call you.
In this area there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting buildings to visit.
The best building you must see is the cathedral.
It is the most important church in this area because of its architecture.
It is something very special.
Its ceiling is made from many small pieces of wood.
Its windows .
It is fantastic.
It is built on the top of the hill and around it there is only a huge field.
You can walk there because the bus stops just at the bottom of the hill.
But really you must see it.
The position of the cathedral .
I hope that all the information you need will be provided satisfactorily.
First of all you have been booked in at the palace hotel.
Secondly the best way to go from the hotel to the conference centre is to use one of the shuttle buses we provide at this event.
They are going to leave at 9 o'clock.
Concerning the end-of-conference party, it is going to take place in the same hotel, the Palace Hotel.
We suggest casual dress for this special event.
Finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but I suggest you visit the Caldea centre, which is a very special centre.
If you need further information do not hesitate to contact us.
In your previous letter you asked for information about interesting buildings to visit in my country.
There are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
The churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of their different Romanic styles.
I suggest you visit first the cathedral of "Le Seu d'Mrgell" because it is the most building in the area.
If you are interested in more modern buildings I suggest you visit "Caldea", which is a very modern centre with beautiful architecture.
Finally if none of my suggestions , let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and I'll do my best to find something more suitable.
I am writing to inform you about a party that we have decided to organise for Mr.
Brown's birthday.
I want to ask you to come to our party and also to help us with what present we should buy for Mr.
Brown.
To begin with, I must explain to you that the party is a surprise for Mr.
Brown and it will take place on Tuesday 16th of June from 3:00 to 6:00 pm at the college canteen.
Some of the children will bring food and also there will be nice music too.
We hope to see you at the party and have a wonderful time together.
My favourite season of the year is summer.
I think that most people love summer, especially the people in Greece.
I don't know why but the summer is the most beautiful season.
All the scenery with the lovely sun, the wonderful beaches, the green mountains and the smell of the sea, make me feel great.
I live in Greece, and to be exact on an island, so I know very well what summer means.
It means swimming at the wonderful beaches, tasting the delicious food and having a wonderful time every day and every night with your friends.
Also it means meeting other people, having fun together, travelling to all the places on the island.
I think that the summer makes people feel great, have fun, enjoy themselves.
I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have a wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever they go.
I am writing to you because my class want to give a surprise birthday party for your husband Mr Brown.
We need your help with the details.
We want to say thanks again for your help and you must be sure that your opinion would be valuable to us.
I am looking forward to receiving your answer and don't forget that it is a surprise birthday party.
Family life nowadays is very important because both parents work and they haven't any time for the children.
In addition children have so many lessons at school that they don't have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are at home.
In spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
Parents play with their children and have fun.
And the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
Besides that the most important thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
To sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in future.
So we also try to make our time creative when we are with our children.
First of all I would like to suggest that you come to our party and we would like you not to tell your husband anything because the party is a surprise.
The party will be organised on Tuesday the 16th of June at three to six pm in the college canteen.
We will have food and drink and we will have music because we know that Mr Brown loves music.
His students, the teachers and the principal will come to the party.
My last question is about a present.
My fellow students have suggested buying a CD or a book.
We would like you to tell us which is the best present for him.
John said he had some good news to tell me.
I didn't believe him at first.
But I could see that his face was happy and he wasn't telling lies.
I stopped talking to my friends and I followed him.
We started walking and walking.
When we arrived at the bus station I couldn't understand why he wanted to go there.
But I didn't ask him.
We waited there for an hour, and I was really angry.
I wanted to know why we were there.
At that moment we saw the bus come, it stopped and one man came and sat near us.
I recognised him.
He was my father.
I couldn't believe it.
I had not seen him for five years.
I thought that I was dreaming but I wasn't.
It was true; my father had come to his country after five years.
All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him.
The party is on Tuesday 16 of June.
You should come to the college canteen at 3 pm.
We have bought some snacks to eat and three students will sing for him, too.
Besides this, we have invited all the other teachers and the Principal of our school.
Of course all the class will take part in this party.
However, we don't know what present to buy for him.
So we would appreciate it if you could help us with this matter.
We have thought about buying a CD or a book.
He loves to read books.
What do you think? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this.
Nowadays people's life has many problems which need some solutions.
In particular young people's lives have been very difficult for the last few years.
The only appropriate way to solve people's problems is the family.
Teenagers usually think about a matter which is drugs.
Their family could explain to them how they avoid things.
They know the way to do this.
And the way is love.
Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children regarding difficulties at school.
They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships.
Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend.
On the other hand, friends are not suitable for doing this.
They definitely don't give real solutions and advice.
There is a chance that they are not such good friends and pretend that they are.
The way in which the family comes in contact with the members so easily is love.
So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions to our problems.
It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come to the party.
All the students wanted to organise a surprise party for Mr Brown.
Next Tuesday is his birthday.
We would like you to come and, if you can, to help us with an important decision.
Firstly, we should tell you that it is a surprise party.
He must not learn about it so you must not tell him.
Secondly, the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June in the college canteen.
We think a suitable time will be 3-6 p.m.
You can come earlier, if you want.
We would have junk food, some juices and drinks.
Moreover, some teachers will come, of course all the students and the Principal.
However, we do not know what to give him as a present.
Can you help us? We want something that he would like or which would be necessary.
Please try to come and help us with this problem.
We are looking forward to your reply.
John said he had some good news to tell me.
I was waiting for him to come.
Suddenly the bell rang.
I thought that it would be John and it was he.
We had finished the exams two weeks before and we were waiting for the results.
The first good news was that we both had passed the exams.
It was wonderful news.
Then we thought about going swimming to talk about some things.
The second news was that he had found a job for the summer.
He would go to work in a café.
He would earn a lot of money, in addition they wanted another person.
As a result I had work too.
We had the greatest day.
Then we had an idea! We would have a lot of money from the work.
At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia.
We imagine that will be the best holiday of our life.
First of all, the reason that we decided to have this party was because Mr Brown helped with the organisation of our trip to France.
And we would appreciate your not telling him about our party.
Secondly, the party is on Tuesday 16th in the evening at the college canteen.
As regards the food, our mothers will help with that.
Also, we will take the drinks from our canteen and there will be a group of musicians for our entertainment.
I hope that I have been of some help to you with the party.
I look forward to seeing you there.
It was Friday morning when I saw John and he said to me he had some good news to tell me.
And it was really good news.
It was about a job which I wanted very much.
He also said that I must be in the office at 7.00 pm the next day.
All night I did not sleep at all.
I was in the office by 6.30 pm.
The executive called me into the office, and he showed me my office.
From, that day, every day I went to the office 30 minutes early.
When I completed a month in this job my executive told John to go to the office.
I was surprised because I did not know what he wanted.
When I went he wanted to tell me that from the next month I would be his personal secretary and my salary would be twice what it was previously.
I could not believe it.
Now, my life is the best that could be imagined.
And every day when I wake up I think that I am living in a dream which I never want to finish.
I am writing with reference to your article which I read in a local newspaper two days ago.
As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction with your article.
First of all, your article mentions that the course had to be cancelled because the teacher was ill, but the course was cancelled only on the last afternoon.
Secondly, you mention that nobody registered for the local history course.
I would like to inform you that 32 attended this course.
Thirdly, as far as the painting and photography courses are concerned, it is true what you say, they were very popular.
I think that the reason for these courses being so popular is that people are very interested in these kinds of activities.
Apart from this, the teachers were very experienced and the equipment was particularly .
Furthermore, your article mentions that the weekend cost over £100.
That is not true.
The cost was only £60 including lunch.
Last but not least, the college is planning to run another activities weekend next term, so it will be sooner than you mention.
I am very happy because I hadn't received any letter from you for a long time and as I had a problem with my mother's health, not a serious one, I didn't write to you.
I hope you are fine.
First of all, you mustn't panic.
It's not a serious enough problem to get upset.
You must be very happy because you have been offered two jobs.
In my opinion, as you're really very keen on history, I think that the ideal job for you is to work in a museum.
Now I don't know if it is tiring but I suppose it will be less tiring than a job in a restaurant.
If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position in the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you.
But you should consider which workplace is more convenient for you.
You'd do better not to travel far away from your home.
Also working in a museum may include big tips from the tourists.
Apart from this, despite the fact that it is a summer job, you could be employed for the whole of next year, if you are lucky.
Last but not least, I hope you will find my opinion helpful.
I hope your problem will be solved, but I don't think that it's a problem.
Whatever choice you make, I'm sure it will be the best for you.
Drop me a line.
Recently I was at the annual international arts festival that you organized.
I'm writing this letter to thank you for giving the opportunity to know more about modern art.
I think it is a wonderful idea to organize such festivals each year, because it is very interesting to learn some news about life in other countries.
Unfortunately, only six countries were represented this year at the festival, but I hope that soon there will be many more of them.
I really liked all the concerts, shows, and exhibitions, but why weren't there any photographic exhibitions? I think you should have some next year.
Also, I want to point out that the concert halls were too small, that is why they were overcrowded during some concerts.
And finally, my opinion is that one weekend ticket for all events is a great idea, because you don't have to wait in queues to buy a ticket for a show you want to go to.
I was very pleased to receive your letter.
You asked if there are some school rules in my country.
As you know, I'm studying at a private Academy, so the rules in my institute are different from the rules in state institutes.
I'll give you an example.
In our Academy we are not allowed to smoke.
The fine for smoking on the Academy's premises is 100 dollars.
So nobody smokes there.
I don't smoke, so I don't care about this rule.
But some of my friends really would like to change it.
You also wanted to know about what I'm allowed or not allowed to do at home.
Well, I have rather modern parents, so they don't stop me going to discos or somewhere with my friends.
The only rule for me at home is to walk  my dog three times a day.
The festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
I assume that this fact attracted people very much.
In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good.
I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets at the normal price to come to the festival.
Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.
However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year.
The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars who participated in it were from six countries only.
Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited.
Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of attendees.
I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls.
Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres in either the films or the plays.
So I suggest you have various kinds, and more plays and films next year.
I hope that next year's festival will be much more successful than this year's one.
People all have different opinions about books.
Some prefer realistic stories whereas others prefer unusual ones.
But I prefer realistic stories such as Ernest Hemingway's "The Old Man and the Sea'.
Above all, realistic stories teach me something about life, or at least influence me.
As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book.
Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging everything he faces.
When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him.
Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.
In addition to that, realistic stories are more attractive, I personally don't want to hear stories about very peculiar incidents as I know they cannot be true.
But, while reading realistic stories, I just fall deep into the story, into the writer's own world.
Ernest Hemingway's sentences are precise, but still very powerful and alive.
So when I read about other sharks eating the shark the old man had caught, I got very angry and annoyed.
Realistic stories thus, develop our imagination and creativity, which are essential in our lives.
I am writing to you to give you some advice about the International Arts Festival.
I think it is a great idea to organise this sort of festival because most people enjoy it.
Firstly, concerning the stars and artists, they came from only six countries.
For music like jazz and rock, it was excellent but for classical concerts we had a problem because some concert halls were too small.
If you have any ideas about bigger halls, it would be better.
Secondly, about the plays and films, it would be good if you had more because the children like them.
The dance shows were absolutely wonderful, like art exhibitions.
Do not change the talks by writers, because it is a good idea if people can talk about their own books.
Finally, concerning the price of the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less stressed, because they can visit for longer.
It would be better if we could hold this festival at the end of summer.
I hope I have given you enough information.
It began when my parents and I were going to the South of France for our holidays.
We went by car.
When we were near Geneva, my father, who was driving the car, was flashed by a radar and the police stopped him.
After that, as he had been driving for a long time, we decided to stop at a service area.
We went to the toilet and ate something in the snack bar.
Suddenly, my father realised he had forgotten to lock the car.
He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggage.
We called the police but they said to us that if we didn't lock our car they couldn't do anything.
It was already the worst holiday in my life but we continued.
When we arrived at the flat, it was eleven o'clock.
The agency was closed and we hadn't got the key.
We went to a hotel, it was expensive and uncomfortable.
Finally,  life in France is crazy, this is the tradition.
This story happened a long time ago.
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival you organized.
I enjoyed it very much and I think you had a great idea.
I also agree with you about the ticket's price.
In fact, it was really a reasonably-priced ticket, excellent because you could go to all the events just with .
And that's the reason why lots of people came.
You have a break of ten minutes, .
You can't speak during the lesson or outside the classrooms.
You can't write on walls and desks..
I have some rules also at home, but they are few.
I can do everything I want, except going out with the car during the night.
My parents are afraid of it because I only got my licence in September.
I am writing to you to give you my opinion about your festival.
It was great, but I think it could be even better next year.
First, it was an international festival, it was a great idea, but only six countries participated.
So, if you could have more than six countries, it would be great.
This idea relates to the number of plays and films.
If there are more stars and artists from around the world, and there are more plays and films it would be better.
My second complaint is about some of the concert halls which were too small.
It would be better if you had some more large halls like your "Arena" hall.
To conclude, I was very happy to have a ticket for all events at a reasonable price, because for someone who does not especially like art, it was very attractive.
My last suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some "salsa" bands.
It would be great to listen and dance at the same time to "salsa" music.
I was very happy to receive a letter from you.
I am writing to you to answer your question about school rules and what I am (and I am not) allowed to do at home.
Firstly, in school it is not permitted to smoke in the no-smoking area or in the classroom.
But I think it is the same in England.
Secondly, when you want to ask the teacher a question, you must put your hand up and speak when the teacher asks you.
In my home, the only things I am not allowed to do are things which might disturb my family.
For example, putting the music on too loud when my sister is working.
But there are also some general rules, like do not put your feet on the table when we are eating or do not eat with your fingers.
There is not really anything that I would like to change, because, as you know, in France, there are not really strict rules like in China or other countries.
There are just rules of politeness.
I hope I answered your question.
I am writing to you in connection with the advertisement in the newspaper.
I would like to explain a couple of thoughts that I had after the festival that I have recently seen.
I believe that it was a great idea to organise such a festival, connected with art and culture.
In particular, the date was very suitable for me, as I have a lot of free time.
What is more, there was a wide variety of music.
Although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
I hope that next year there will be many more possibilities to enjoy films or plays and that the halls will be bigger, as they were overcrowded.
However I was really surprised that the entrance fee was so low.
I also have one suggestion, if I may.
Maybe next year the festival could end with a firework display.
Thank you for your kind attention and I hope that my advice will be useful.
I just got your letter and sat down straight away to write a few sentences to you that will illustrate my opinion.
To begin with, I'd like to show you what my obligations are at school.
Although we have to change our shoes, we don't need to wear special uniforms.
Our clothes should be in good taste.
We are also allowed to have jewellery and make-up, which is especially important for girls.
When it comes to my home, I think I have the usual duties: I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother.
Furthermore, my parents aren't demanding: I have to be home by 11 o'clock at the latest and tell them where I am going .
In my opinion there's nothing particular that I'd like to change, except maybe only having to change my shoes.
I hope that this will clarify your questions and doubts.
So, that will be everything for now.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea.
That also goes for the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time.
On the other hand, I would like to point out that the festival could appeal to more people if a few improvements were made.
Firstly, you had said in your advertisement that artists from around the world would perform.
Actually, they came from only six countries.
What is more, some concert halls were too small.
As a result, it was impossible for all the audience to fit in there.
Finally, I suggest you think about giving the audience the opportunity to see more plays and films.
I'm really happy to hear from you again.
I'm sorry for not writing earlier.
Unfortunately, I'm quite busy so don't worry if I'm late replying to some of your letters.
In your last letter, you wondered what the rules of behaviour at school and at home are like in my country, so I'm going to give you some information.
In Poland, rules that refer to the way we dress at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at.
We can neither eat nor drink during lessons.
We are supposed not to be late for lessons and, of course, students mustn't smoke at school.
At home, young people should help their parents do some housework.
Generally, we are supposed to treat our parents (as well as the teachers at school) with respect and not to argue with our brothers and sisters.
I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year.
I was so impressed with the exhibitions at the festival that you organized.
Furthermore, it's a worthwhile experience for people who want to know about other countries' arts.
But I would like to make some requests regarding the festival.
Firstly, it would be better to invite more artists .
For example, .
Secondly, some concert halls were too small to contain all of the audience.
Moreover, plays and films were shown only twice a day so that people .
I would like more performances to be held next year in the bigger halls.
Finally, with regard to tickets, it is a really wonderful idea because it is more convenient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people.
.
A long long time ago, there were an old man and old woman who lived at the foot of a mountain.
She grew very quickly and was so beautiful.
A lot of men asked her to marry them but she always refused.
One night she said to her parents sadly, 'I have to return to the Moon tonight.' The old man and woman tried to get her to stay in their house, but they couldn't.
Her servants from the Moon carried her up to the Moon.
She had gone away.
She was the princess of the Moon.
This happened a long time ago.
I am writing to you about the festival.
I am a student at London College studying English.
I have always been interestedin arts and festivals.
It was great that you organised the Arts Festival in this city, because people really need this kind of social activity here.
I spent two days at the International Arts Festival with some of my friends and I must say we were really delighted, it was a great idea to do that in London.
We all liked the jazz, rock and classical concerts.
However, the concert halls were too small and lots of people couldn't get into the concert halls and there were stars and artists .
I believe there should be more plays and films next year and the stars and artists should be from around the world.
One reasonably-priced ticket for all events was excellent because it's always busy at the weekend and people prefer to go any weekday.
I hope you will consider my opinions and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year.
I look forward to hearing from you.
I received your letter just this morning.
It was very nice to hear from you.
In my country's schools we are not allowed to have an argument with classmates and are not allowed to eat in class.
We can't listen to music in class either.
We always have to keep everywhere clean, but these kinds of rules are not very strict I believe.
At home it is completely different, my mum is quite organised, so she is always making new rules.
Firstly, I have to keep my room clean and hoover once a week.
I have to cook and the worst thing is I'm not allowed to listen to loud music anywhere at home.
I'm not allowed to stay out after midnight.
When I grow up I'll change all the rules in my life and I'll make my own rules which are not going to be too strict.
Look forward to hearing from you soon.
I am writing this letter in order to make some suggestions for the International Arts Festival that took place a while ago.
I was there for two days enjoying it and have found some points I would like to change to make it a better one next year.
I personally think it is a great idea to gather all different types of arts from all over the world.
Well, here are some of my opinions and suggestions.
First of all, I think there should be more stars and artists from more countries because this year, I believe there were artists from only six countries which, in my opinion, is not quite from all over the world.
The jazz, rock and classical concerts were really entertaining except that there were some concert halls which were too small for the audience: I'm sure that you can find bigger halls for next year.
By the way, I was also wondering if it was possible to have more plays and films for the coming festival as the reaction of the people was excellent.
Actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! I, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events.
Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate you on the great success of the festival.
Hello! It's been such a long time since we wrote to each other.
Well, in the letter you wrote me, you asked some questions about school and house rules.
Even though I do have less than you, I still want to change many things.
In our school, you're not allowed to eat during class.
You must have permission to get out of your seat or leave the classroom.
My school's an American school so you're not supposed to talk in Spanish during the classes either.
At home, there are fewer rules.
My parents don't really like imposing rules in the house.
But still I cannot go out of the house without telling my mom where I am going and when I'm coming back.
But it has existed since I was very young.
I would like to change the rule about not speaking in Spanish at school because most of us feel more comfortable speaking in Spanish, but I guess, to learn, we should speak English all the time.
I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added to next year's International Arts Festival, which in my opinion has been a great idea .
Although I read that stars and artists came from around the world, I realised that they only came from six countries.
I had a good time at the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small.
I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable.
All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
The rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive.
I think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
I'm sorry I haven't written for so long, but I have been very busy with my exams.
It's good to hear that you have passed all of yours.
I hope this is what you wanted from me.
I'm looking forward to seeing you soon.
Despite all this I would like to complain about some details.
First of all, stars were supposed to come from all around the world.
Apparently there were artists from only six countries.
I would also like to suggest that you try and make more plays and films available next year.
I trust you will give this matter your careful attention.
I look forward to visiting the International Arts Festival next year.
It was very interesting to hear about the rules in England.
The rules in Poland are quite similar to those described in your letter.
What about house rules? Well, we both know that parents are the ones who rule at home.
All the things we're not allowed to do depend on them.
Anyway, I must finish now.
Has your dog recovered now? I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
 However, I would like to make a suggestion that you could consider for it.
The name of the event, International Arts Festival, is a great idea actually, but there were stars and artists from only six countries .
I suppose more countries are going to be informed even during and after the events.
The second point I would like to make is about the concerts which showed people Jazz, rock and classical music, which were fantastic.
However,  some concert halls were too small.
Quite few seats were available for the audience, so a few people had to stand and watch the concerts.
I see you might not have had much time to be well-organised.
Finally, I would like to see the good side of things about the weekend ticket.
It is an excellent price because when I am tempted to watch some festivals, obviously it costs much more money.
At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommend it to other friends.
That's how I am feeling about that.
I expect you will be even better organised next year.
Nowadays while my country is developing, most people are very busy, so they can't bring up their children.
For example, if students behave wrongly at school, they will have some punishments even up to now.
What else, unless they pass the exam they have to have extra lessons or tests.
But most teachers consult with their parents, so if they behave wrongly it is true that teachers call their parents.
Apart from that, at home, children are not allowed to use impolite words and on the weekend they have to help parents to do some chores.
But people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
my name is John and I went to the latest International Arts Festival.
The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event.
First, I would like to congratulate you on the success you have been having year after year.
Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be useful for next year's festival.
The artists you brought were only from six different countries, so I think next time you should try to invite people from more nationalities, to make it more interesting than it is already.
Moreover, I have been thinking about changing the location because, as you probably already know, some concert halls were not big enough to let everybody who wanted to go in.
Finally, I would just like to ask you not to give up showing movies during the festival because the crowds were thrilled with them, and keep on offering the current prices, one of the best deals for us, the spectators.
If you would like to talk about my suggestions, please, do not hesitate to get in touch and let me know.
I think, therefore, that there is no difficulty in finding a job for our spare time.
What really makes us, the students, upset, is finding the perfect job.
To be more technical and specific, we need a very flexible job, which gives us independence and allows us to stop working when we are not able to, for example during the exams period.
Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us would be a position related to our degree.
Next year I expect to finish my studies in LAW.
And by that time I will already have some experience, so that I will be able to apply more easily for a really good job.
I'm writing this letter to congratulate you on the excellent international arts festival we enjoyed last November.
I think it was a very good idea.
However, there are a few things that I personally think could be improved in future years.
First of all, because of the advertisement I expected stars and artists from all over the world but they came from only six countries.
Artists from different cultures could make the festival even more interesting.
Secondly, although the music concerts were good, I think that some concert halls were too small.
It was a shame to find that some of them were sold out because of the reduced number of seats available.
However, I really enjoyed the dance shows and the plays and films.
I suggest it might be a good idea to arrange more projections next year.
Moreover, in my opinion two days is a short time for this kind of event, and I strongly encourage you to organise a full week's festival.
Finally, the price was reasonable and it was helpful to have one ticket for all the weekend.
I hope you'll act on my suggestions.
Once upon a time, in a small Catalan village, there was a little boy who loved fooling around and making jokes.
His father was a shepherd, and he had one hundred sheep and one dog, and he used to take the animals to the mountain to feed them.
One day, he became ill and was worried about the animals.
His little son, called Joan, said quickly: "I will help you.
I will take care of the sheep for you, father".
Some people came to help him, and then realised that it was not true.
They were angry.
He did it some more times, and in the end nobody took any notice of the shouts.
One day, the fox attacked his animals and he shouted as much as he could.
Nobody came.
Then he learned always to tell the truth.
First of all I have to say that the whole festival was a great success and I also think you chose an appropriate title for the leaflet.
However, there are some points which can be improved for the next year.
To begin with, you wrote in the leaflet that stars and artists from around the world could be seen in the performance.
In fact, there were only six countries involved.
My suggestion for this point is to invite more people from different countries.
Furthermore some concert halls were definitely too small or in other words too many people attended those concerts.
You could avoid this kind of problem if you look for big halls at the outset.
Another point where you could improve is if you show more plays and films next year.
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
To finish this letter , I would like to give you a good idea for next year.
In my opinion it would be nice if you created an exhibition space where the guests can try to play different instruments.
I think everybody will ask himself this question one day or has already asked it.
Anyway the people who asked this question probably found out that it isn't so easy to earn money or that it is sometimes too much work.
A traditional way to earn money, in your spare time, is to deliver newspapers or magazines to the families in your town or village.
The problem that you have here is the weather.
For example when it is rainy, because then everything gets wet.
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help with changing the film rolls, cleaning the toilets or doing some other small jobs.
But in the case that you really want to do some interesting work in your spare time you should try to sell something that you're good at, I mean if you're interested in computers you should try to provide your service for other people.
Of course in the beginning it is hard but you can learn a lot and if you're good at it you'll also earn some money.
Okay don't wait, .
I attended your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions for it.
I must say that the International Arts Festival is really a great idea.
And your last festival was very interesting too.
But also there are some that you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
First of all, you must invite artists and stars from more countries around the world, because there were people only from six countries.
I think it can make your festival more popular.
Your dance shows are very beautiful, the art exhibition is something original and exciting.
And also it is very interesting to talk with writers.
I think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want.
I hope you will continue holding your festivals.
I must say that the rules aren't the same in the schools of our country.
Every school has its own rules.
I think that my school is very democratic and so there are very good relations between teachers and students.
We are all very friendly in our class and we help each other when we have a problem.
So the main rule in our school is teachers.
I'm allowed to do many things at home.
My parents are very kind, and they know that their son will do everything right.
And the main reason why our family is so friendly is because we haven't got many rules.
So, I think there isn't anything I'd like to change.
I am writing to you to give some opinions about the International Arts Festival that you organized last November.
First of all, I believe that it was very interesting, but there were fewer artists than I had expected.
In fact, they came from six countries.
I wonder if it is possible for next year to have more artists and also bigger concert halls.
In fact I have noticed that some concerts needed more space.
I would be grateful if, next year, you could include more art exhibitions (with more pictures) in the programme.
I was very interested in the festival ticket.
It was not expensive and was easy to use, because there was only one for all the events.
I would offer you one suggestion that concerns the classical concerts.
I think it would be interesting to invite young composers to hear new things from classical music.
In my country there are some rules that are the same in all schools.
For example, we have to dress in an appropriate way, not talk to each other during the lessons and pay attention to the teachers.
At this time, in my school there is a new rule.
We aren't allowed to use a mobile phone in class.
Before this rule it was funny (new sound in class, phones ring or sing.), but not for our headmaster.
I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time at which my family can eat together.
For me, it's very stressful and I usually run a lot to do it.
In fact (you know) I like with my classmates after our lessons.
The discovery of the ôInternational Arts Festivalö was a pleasure for me because it gave me the opportunity to enjoy a really nice environment.
The reasonably-priced package, including tickets and accommodation, well suited my personal situation: comfortable rooms that are easy to reach and tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute.
As far as the Festival itself is concerned, some small improvements could make it work better.
 Having different kinds of music is a good idea but some of them need special features.
Larger concert halls can allow people to better enjoy the quality of the performances.
Also, the introduction of different cultural experiences is a good idea but six countries can't really be considered as representative of the world.
The aim to satisfy different interests should not cause the quality to decrease.
Anyway, the best suggestion is always the ôbest ideaö, the famous ôsuch a good ideaö that might change your lifeà.
I'm still looking for it.
My name is Rosa Santor.
I'm 24 and I'm a student from Poland.
I study architecture at the Polytechnic in Krakow.
I'm very interested in art, especially in paintings and going to galleries.
I'm writing you a letter, because you are the organiser of an International Arts Festival.
I recently spent two days at this festival.
Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year.
It's very good that you organised an International Arts Festival in our country, but in my opinion, if this is an international festival, it should have more stars and artists from around the world, not from only six countries, like this year.
It was a great idea to do something like that.
There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concert halls were too small for all the people who attended that festival.
There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year.
Also it was a great idea to have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.
I think, as a person who attended this festival, that it was excellent, because we could spend a lot of time with art.
There is only one bad thing, that this festival was too short.
In my opinion, next year it should take place over more than two days.
receive a letter from you, because I know that you are busy, but please look at my suggestion for next year's festival.
I've just received this letter from you, so I'm writing to you.
I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years.
You wrote that in your class, you've been talking about rules, both at home and at school.
So now, I would like to tell you something about the school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home.
As you know, I'm not a secondary school student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow.
I have lessons from Monday till Friday.
On Saturday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work.
We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons.
At my school there is a lot of drawing and painting, and some other subjects done by hand.
We also learn how to design interiors and buildings.
It's very interesting.
We usually have lessons in the morning, till the afternoon.
We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class.
There are also some exams.
After a few months we go somewhere with all the class, for example near a lake, and there we paint nature.
I don't have trouble with my education.
My friends and teachers are nice and friendly, but there is one thing I'd like to change in my school.
I'd like to have more tests during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
I'm looking forward to receiving another letter from you.
I think that you won't forget, & will write to me soon.
I'm writing to express my feeling and opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held a few days ago.
When I found the advertisement for the International Arts Festival, I was very excited.
It is to hold an annual international arts festival in this place.
Then I spent two days at the festival.
I enjoyed it very much.
There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world, jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance shows etc.
The thing that is worth remembering here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourists could what they liked.
Thanks for reading this letter, I'm looking forward to next year's festival.
You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter.
This reminds me of what I experienced during my teenage years.
In my country the children go to secondary school when they are in the first year of being a teenager.
You know, this age is the troublesome age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone.
They always annoy the schoolteacher and their parents.
As a result of this, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in class.
They have to finish homework within a limited time.
They cannot  the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make-up or wear any jewellery.
At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me a lot of homework to do, even in the holiday.
They also forbade me to have a boyfriend.
I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friends had the same experience.
Now I'm a mother of two children.
They are both in school.
Compared to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything.
I want to be a mother to them and a friend to them.
But at school, although I hope the teacher doesn't give students so much homework, and doesn't forbid the of the students, there is nothing I can do because of our culture.
It's quite sad.
Firstly, I want to tell you that the idea of the "International Arts Festival" was a really great idea.
I enjoyed the festival much.
However I think that it could be better if you could rearrange small details.
I think that next year you should have more artists from different countries, so that it can be a real International Festival.
.
Another point which I think was annoying was the concert hall.
The concerts were great but the hall was too small for so many people.
I hope that next year the concerts will take place in a bigger hall.
The plays and the films were really great.
I enjoyed all of them.
I hope to see many more films next year.
The best thing about the festival was the price I think, because it had a really big effect on the , and that of course made the festival much more enjoyable.
Actually not all the schools in Turkey are so strict but unfortunately the school that I'm going to is like a military camp.
The uniform we wear has to be perfect.
No one is allowed to wear anything which isn't written in the school rules.
The general rules which are used in all schools aren't so strict, however there are a few things that need to be changed.
For example, if you don't come to school for 10 days in a year, you fail that year.
Thank God it isn't so strict at home.
My family allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course, which I don't do anyway.
I am allowed to stay up late, I'm allowed to bring my friends home and stuff like that.
However there is one thing that my parents don't like me to do.
They hate it when I play music loudly.
I think they don't like the music I listen to.
This is all that I can tell you about my school and family.
Rules are everywhere and you can't change them.
So just don't think about them.
I recently spent two days at your annual international arts festival.
It was the first time I have been and I was very pleased to go.
Actually, I wasn't disappointed.
However I would like to give my opinion about the festival.
First of all, I congratulate you on organising this kind of event.
It was such a great success that some people weren't able to get tickets! You should increase the number of places you offer.
, you could invite artists from around the world and not only from six countries: it would be more pleasant.
Although I am keen on classical music, I found some concert halls too small.
I was wondering if you could improve that? Also, there were some interesting films but not enough.
Perhaps you could possibly some producers who come from other countries in order to show different cultures.
, to buy one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent because we could see all that we wanted without paying each time.
I see you are interested in hearing about school rules in France and also about what I am allowed to do or not to do at home.
At home, I have to look after my two little brothers when my parents are here.
If I don't do the cooking, I will have to do the washing up.
I am sometimes allowed to watch the television when I have finished my homework.
Fortunately, I can play the violin when I want, even if I haven't done my homework.
It is what I like most.
I don't really want to change that, I think it is fair like this.
I hope this answer satisfies you.
I have read the advertisement for the festival and I must say it is a great idea.
I would like to give you some suggestions.
I find the reasonably-priced ticket excellent, because there are a lot of people who go to see only one or two events, and by paying for the all-events ticket, they might see other events and learn about something they didn't expect to find interesting.
I would like you to answer my letter.
Here in Brazil the rules at school depend on the school.
In general, the rules at private schools are much stricter than the ones at state schools.
In mine, we didn't have many rules.
For example, nobody said anything when we smoked in the garden or in the bathroom.
We were allowed to go out if we didn't want to stay in class.
But we had to wear the uniform and we had to study a lot to pass the exams.
The rules at home are very different.
I am allowed to do what I want as long as I study enough to .
I think that my parents let me do what I want because they trust me.
They know that if I go out with the car, I will not drink.
It is not always easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.
First of all, I'd like you to know that the whole organization was almost excellent.
I spent two nice days at the festival full of art.
The idea of making the festival "international" was very good.
I could find the opportunity to watch artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries.
The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls being too small.
The plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year.
I attended the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures.
The dance shows were a sight for our sore eyes; they were really fascinating.
I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, not to mention their lifestyles, by talking to them.
In addition to all that, the idea of joining in all the activities with one ticket was excellent because it saved you from having to buy one ticket for each activity.
Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and other things, and also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect.
Thank you for holding a great festival which made all the arts activities come together.
I'm glad that everything's going on well there.
It's the same here.
I've got a lot of exams at the moment, but that's all.
By the way, it would be better if you wrote to me quite often.
The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very disciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviour.
I understand the second part, but I can't understand the reason for only wearing white and dark blue.
Do we become the "perfect one" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules.
It can be said that I'm much freer at home.
I'm allowed to do whatever I want in my room.
I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about.
There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust.
I think I show these three to them.
I am writing to you to thank you for your very good organisation of the International Arts Festival, where I spent two excellent days recently.
But I hope that next year visitors to the festival will be able to be introduced to more art groups from all over the world.
I suggest it would be very interesting to meet artists from faraway and exotic countries.
Want to be independent? Earn money for yourself.
Everybody knows that ordinary students are not the richest people in the world.
But when you are at university you need money more .
It is so because you are young and need to make your life as interesting as it can be now.
Of course, the easiest way to get it is to ask your parents for help, but a great number of young people want to be independent.
So they need to get a job and that is very difficult when you haven't got any special education and experience yet.
The most common way to earn money is babysitting.
Many young people earn their pocket money in this way, helping parents in the neighbourhood to have a bit more spare time.
Other students work as house or office managers, sell different goods or even work as bouncers.
Naturally, it's easier to get a job when you are good at foreign languages or computers.
Then you can find yourself work as a tourist guide or as a secretary.
The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival.
I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there should be some improvements to make this festival better.
Firstly, there were stars and artists from only six countries.
This number should be increased to attract more and different people.
Also some concert halls were too small for this many people.
In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then.
I must admit that you were very successful at finding good stars.
there were not very many films and plays.
As a result of this there were not enough kinds of films.
In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased.
I have nothing to say about the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers.
They were excellent and they attracted all kinds of people.
Another point is the tickets.
The weekend ticket is excellent because it is not very expensive and it allows you to see everything.
But I was disappointed that there was no competition between the films shown.
I think there should be an Oscar-like competition in order to make people more ambitious to make better films.
The school rules are horrible here.
We are restricted in doing nearly everything.
The school is like a dungeon here.
I don't want to be so evil about school but rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school.
However we are free at home.
You can do anything you like as long as you have good grades.
If you don't, you hear the same word every day, "Study, Study, Study"! Nobody likes to study but we have to.
I'm writing to you in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival.
I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been to.
I also hope that the festival could be even better next year.
The great idea of making it "international" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (said to be "from around the world") were from only six countries.
Maybe the reason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones.
On the other hand, the wide range of plays and films to choose from impressed me the most.
I thank you for organizing it, and hope to see more next year.
I also thank you for the excellent idea of having one ticket for all events, which allowed me to see all the things I was interested in.
Thank you for your last letter - I was very pleased to receive it.
If you really want to hear about school rules in my country, I'll try to write about them briefly.
We do not have many school rules, and the teachers are rather liberal.
We don't have to wear any special uniforms or of our school.
Some rules are really simple: we must be at school on time, and we must not disturb others during classes.
We are not allowed to smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol of course! In winter we are to change our shoes.
It may sound funny, but mud, gravel and snow lying on the school floors is not a nice sight, so we change our shoes without questioning that rule.
I am also used to writing exams which are very often in Polish schools.
Last I spent two days at the Festival.
I enjoyed myself very much, but I think that the organization of the next festival could be better.
First of all, as I see it the idea of an Arts Festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who come from different countries.
Unfortunately, in the last the artists came from only six countries, so I think you should invite artists from other countries, for example from Africa.
Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts for different kinds of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concert halls were too small, and because of that I couldn't see one of the concerts on the programme.
In my opinion, one of the best things about the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there.
I saw films and I played ping-pong.
At the next will there be more or less of that? More I hope.
The thing that I liked much more than anything else was that I only had to buy one ticket for all the events, and it was not pricey.
It is clear that for me the last Festival was really great, so I have only one suggestion to give you.
I think you should have a kindergarten.
In fact a certain number of women couldn't see the Festival because of their children.
I like reading very much, because every book that I read shows me a different world.
What I am trying to explain is that in every book there are characters or situations that are really different.
So we can read realistic stories or fantastic ones.
It depends on what we prefer.
I always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality.
One of my favourite books is without doubt Wuthering Heights, a famous book written by Emily Brontë.
The attention of the is focused on the unfortunate love between Heatcliff and Catherine.
They are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of their passions.
In this book you can find only good or bad characters; everything is good or bad.
If you look at this book like a painting you can't see of colours, you see only primary colours.
In other words, when I read a book I want to go into a world where I can find something different from my everyday life.
I'm writing to you because I went to the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure.
Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts.
Also, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful for you for the next festival.
Firstly, I want to congratulate you on the idea.
I think that the development of the arts is very important and that everybody could attend without paying too much.
Having one ticket for all the events is a great method because it's way of paying and you save time.
On the other hand, I must tell you that some concert halls are too small, so you can't be comfortable enough to appreciate the event.
Another thing is that the artists come only from six countries, so don't deceive people by saying that they are from all over the world.
In my opinion, you should invite more artists from other countries and have some bigger concert halls or maybe change the distribution.
Thanks for your letter: it was nice to hear from you again.
I've recently started classes so all the rules were given to us, as you know, on the first day.
As you wanted me to tell you what the rules are like here, I'll start.
Firstly, in our classroom you can't shout, you must be quiet and sit down.
You must always pay attention because you don't know if the teacher will ask you some question.
In exams, you can't talk to the teacher, and you mustn't eat chewing gum or take a Walkman with you.
In my home I can avoid those rules.
My mum just doesn't want me to arrive late.
However, I can go dancing whenever I want but I must tell her beforehand.
My mum is a lovely woman and she doesn't know how much I love her because most of the day I'm outside, but that's the truth.
My father is a bit jealous but agrees with what my mum says.
So, I'm free when I'm out of school.
.
I'm writing to express my dissatisfaction with the International Arts Festival, which was organised by you last year.
However, I think that International Arts Festival is a great idea but I suggest you prepare it better.
should be more.
Secondly, the concerts took place in concert halls which in my opinion were too small.
That was the reason why some people were complaining.
Thirdly, I suggest you put more plays and films on next year, because watching them is a very nice way of spending our free time.
Nowadays everybody wants to earn money.
Young people know that money makes the world go round, so they always look for a job with a big salary.
Some people say that the young shouldn't be independent and earn on their own, but I am sure that it's better to work in your free time than waste it.
In my opinion, the young should work rather than wait for their pocket money.
There are a lot of possibilities of earning some money but of course the young are not able to get a well-paid job, because they are not experienced and educated enough.
They have to think about  jobs.
Firstly, a good way to earn money is to help the old.
They are often not able to do their shopping or walk the dog.
If you help them, they may give you some money as a reward.
Secondly, you can find an easy job in a shopping centre.
It's better paid and a permanent job.
You can work in storage, look after the goods or catch shoplifters.
If you are a good mathematician you can be a seller.
Thirdly, if you are good-looking you can apply for a job in a restaurant and become a waiter.
Maybe you'll not get a big salary but think about the tips, which in the posh restaurants are very high.
Lastly, if you like playing instruments and you don't like working you can go busking.
If you are a good musician you will get a lot of money.
I'm one of the people that enjoyed the last International Arts Festival.
Most of the attractions were excellent, but I'd like to point out that the .
First of all, .
I suppose you had difficulty managing the schedule.
Second, some concert halls were too small, so some of the audience couldn't concentrate on listening to the music.
And others couldn't enter the hall.
But the "all-in-one ticket" was a good idea.
In fact queuing up in front of every ticket office is a waste of time.
I presume if the the festival will become better, because it'll be easier to manage the artists' schedule and the audience can enjoy .
Thank you for your letter.
And I'd like to answer your question.
First, in Japan, generally school rules are more strict than at home.
The gap between them is tremendously big! I can say the actions which are prohibited at school are no problem at home, because the purpose of school rules is not only to create discipline but also unity.
Here, I will write down one of the rules at my school.
"Whenever the students wear an extra item of clothing (because of the cold or something) his or her (not the student!) parents fill in an application form with their signatures".
I am writing this letter to give my opinion on the last International Arts Festival.
Firstly, I found the number of stars and artists who came to the festival amazing although they were from only six countries around the world.
The concerts and the dance show were incredible, except for the classical concert that was in too small a hall.
In conclusion, I was impressed by all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events.
The price was excellent because there wasn't any time limit.
I hope that you organise this festival for all the coming years.
How are you? I was pleased to hear from you.
As you already know I go to an English school, Bear House, in Spain.
The rules in my country are normal, I mean, the rules are very similar to other countries in Europe.
At school you aren't allowed to bring in connected mobile phones although there is more than one student that does .
Teachers will take it from you if it rings during school hours.
Nor are you allowed to bring drugs or arms, to smoke or to drink alcohol inside the school.
You have to respect other people's opinions, teachers, school equipment and people who work in the school.
If you break one of these rules you could be expelled for a week, a month or for ever.
At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful of my parents' timetable.
I can go out at night once a week if I tell them where I'm going to be.
If I lie to them or don't explain the plans that my friends and I have I won't be able to go out, and will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when they aren't at home.
In answer to your question, I wouldn't change anything because I think that these are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future.
I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related to what I saw at the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find.
First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible for this good idea.
We all know that our city lacks art festivals and cultural activities in general.
And what better way to solve this than to give the festival an international character.
But including only six countries in the festival does not seem enough, in my opinion.
I think next year you should invite more countries, because the festival would be more multicultural.
Secondly, there were some accommodation problems in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small.
Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays.
In addition, I would like to talk about the success of the weekend ticket with most visitors, due to its economical price and because of its ease of use.
Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, like ska or world music.
Who doesn't want to earn some money? says that young people have a lot of problems, but without any doubt, money is one of the most important of them.
If you still don't have financial independence from your parents and your studies don't permit you to have a full-time job, these are some suggestions that maybe will help you.
Another thing that can be useful is to make some pottery or do original paintings and sculptures.
You don't need to be a Picasso: a bit of imagination is enough.
If you don't feel like doing any of these things, you have alternative solutions.
If you like fishing, you can try to collaborate with the local market or some shops, in order to sell them the fish you catch yourself.
Finally, if none of the above achieves a result, you could organise  parties in discos or work as a babysitter.
It doesn't matter how, the aim is always money.
Secondly, despite the high quality of the concerts, some of the halls they were given in were too small for the audience.
They were cold and damp, too, because the air-conditioning system was inadequate.
Thirdly, I think more plays and films should be shown next year.
However, I found the idea of a single ticket for all the events of the weekend excellent, as the price was reasonable and access to a wide range of events was provided.
Firstly, the weirdest rule in our schools is that we must wear uniforms all the time.
This is especially bad for us girls, as we are obliged to wear skirts and we cannot climb the stairs or run like the boys.
But apart from this, I think most rules of the school are quite reasonable, like addressing the teacher using the second person plural (it is different in Turkish) or standing up when s/he enters the class.
As we are a developing country, teachers are quite respected.
Another thing that is different from your schools is that we don't change classrooms between periods.
We stay in the class in which we have been registered for the whole year, and a different teacher comes in every period.
Let me talk about the rules at home.
We like chatting on the phone so much that most of our parents have limited the talking time to five minutes, threatening to cut off the otherwise.
Also, as most of us live in flats, we're not allowed to listen to loud music or run or play ball games in the house! But we are legally allowed to play instruments like the piano until 10 p.m.
I'd love to write more, Mary, but I'm in a real rush nowadays.
This month has been full of exams and there are still some coming up next week, so I must be a swot as you see.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing your comments about our rules.
I had a wonderful time at the International Arts Festival.
I think this festival is a great idea in that it allows people to enjoy arts from around the world, but I also have some complaints.
First of all, I was disappointed when I found that there were no artists from Indonesia.
There were stars and artists from only six countries.
Secondly, the concert halls.
The performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were there that day.
A crowded hall is not good when it comes to enjoying music.
Overall, however, the festival was definitely a great success.
I liked the plays and films, and want to see more next year.
The special tickets were excellent because we could enjoy the arts without worrying about money.
So all you need to improve things are larger concert halls.
I also suggest that you should make it easier to find out where and what is going on using more noticeboards.
I have no doubt that you will succeed with next year's festival.
I would like to recommend the job of home tutor.
It is a job where you become a teacher and visit your student at his or her house.
The best advantage of this job is the pay.
It is very good considering how little time we spend on it.
It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district.
It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies.
Students who want home tutors are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and that means they take lessons after school, not in the daytime.
So, in the daytime, we can focus on our studies.
It is not so easy for every student, though, because teaching requires a lot of knowledge.
You have to be much smarter than your student, and you also need to prepare for lessons, because it is your responsibility to provide your student with the right information.
As you see, teaching is hard work in some respects.
But I am enjoying it and getting a lot out of it.
I am writing to you because I have some suggestions for next year's festival, and if it is possible I would like to give you some opinions about this year's festival.
Firstly, in your advertisement it states: stars and artists from around the world, but this year they were only from six countries.
It would be great if there were more artists and not just six.
Secondly, the concerts were fantastic, especially the rock concerts.
I enjoyed them a lot, but some of the halls are too small.
I saw that a lot of people were unsatisfied.
Another thing, plays and films.
I saw only 2 plays and 3 films.
For me it is too few.
One of the reasons that I have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays.
In the future, I hope to be an actress and that's why I want to learn something from the professionals.
I hope that next year I will.
The rules at school are: we must be on time for lessons, and we must always do our homework.
Everybody must be present at lessons.
If someone is ill, they must bring a note from a doctor.
And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to the teachers.
At home I must clean my room and vacuum the home.
I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows.
I like cleaning my home, and I like it when it is clean and fresh.
However I'm the only child and I don't have to do too much but I want to and I like it.
There is one thing I would like to change, and that is the treatment students receive from teachers.
They want too much fromstudents and are unkind to them.
That's all.
I hope that I have given you answers for all the questions you had.
I spent two days at the annual international arts festival from 21 to 22 of November.
This festival was well organised.
There were a lot of activities for everyone.
I really liked the exhibitions.
I had a chance to see amazing pictures painted by Russian painters.
There was an excellent jazz concert.
The band "Three Kings" presented a new style of music.
I would like to that the dance show was absolutely marvellous.
What a great idea to invite writers ! I really liked talking with them.
From my point of view I can complain only about the small concert hall and the fact there were artists from only six countries.
Nowadays many people are fond of classical music, but this concert was too small.
That's why many people missed this classical concert.
You wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
It was really a pity because I expected to see artists from France and Italy.
The International Arts Festival was organised quite well.
I would only recommend you have more artists and the classical concert should be in a bigger hall .
One man and one woman lived in a small house beside the sea.
Their names were Ivan and Maria.
They were so poor that sometimes they hardly had anything to eat.
One day Ivan caught a fish.
It wasn't a normal fish.
It was a Gold Fish and it talked to him like a human: ' Please, let me go and I can do anything you want for you'.
But Ivan was such a kind person that he let Gold Fish go without making any conditions.
Afterwards he came back home.
He told his wife this story.
She was angry and she said that Ivan was just a foolish man.
She persuaded him to go to the sea to ask for a lot of things for her.
Ivan had to do what she said.
Gold Fish did everything that Ivan asked.
When he came back home, he was surprised because Maria was more angry than before.
She said that what Gold Fish had done for her wasn't enough.
Ivan had to beg Gold Fish again and again.
In the end, greedy Maria wanted impossible things.
She said that Ivan should bring Gold Fish home and Ivan could leave their house because she didn't need him anymore.
Maria wanted too much and Gold Fish .
Maria and Ivan were poor again.
I'm an Italian student who went to the last International Arts Festival.
I think this festival is a great idea because it's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art, but I also think there are some things that could be changed.
I noticed that the artists were from only six countries from around the world.
This doesn't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves.
There were many events and I think there were a few plays and films.
Maybe it would be better to put more of them in the programme because young people like them so much.
 young people, the decision to offer a reasonably priced weekend ticket is an excellent idea because it .
I hope that my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival .
Thank you and .
I think a good way to get money is to work in a fast-food restaurant.
Maybe the first impression isn't positive but, from my personal experience, I can say that this kind of job is fine for getting some money.
For six months I've worked in a McDonald's restaurant in Italy and I've got lots of money.
I worked eight hours every day, but in every fast-food restaurant you can work part-time, four, three, six hours every day.
This kind of job is perfect for young people who want to get money and at the same time have to study.
If you work in a fast-food restaurant you can work in the afternoon, or during the night, and so you have time for yourself.
Among the staff you can also find young people and have fun with them during work.
Not only were there Jazz and Rock but there were classical concerts as well.
The only thing that distracted me was the size of the concert halls.
 They were very small and I was pushed by everyone.
There were wonderful plays and films which I hope there will be more of.
All the other shows such as dance shows, art exhibitions and talks by writers were very entertaining.
I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably priced for all events.
I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days at the Arts Festival in the end.
On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.
The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.
They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.
He came and said to the widower that he was to take him on his back.
The widow, who was afaid, told the man about the gold.
When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.
He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake in half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle.
I've got just one more suggestion for next year's festival.
You could probably show a few more films and interviews with the most interesting artists.
I'm sure it would attract lots of young people.
Thank you so much for your lovely letter, it's always great to get something from you.
How are things going over there? It's quite difficult to talk about our school rules actually, but I'll try to help you somehow.
Hope it will be interesting for you.
By the way, are you allowed to smoke in the school? Our teachers don't let us smoke, of course, but you can always see some students smoking outside, so it's not that strict to be honest.
We're not allowed to drink alcohol as well and quarrel with any of the teachers.
As for our rules at home, it's always different and just depends on your family.
My parents are not very strict, as you know, and I appreciate them for giving me freedom.
They understand that I can make my own decisions, but I know they will never leave me and they will help me and my brother any time we need it.
I think the only rule in my house is to care about each other.
I went to the International Arts Festival and saw some interesting things, but many points could be better.
That is why I'm writing to you, to give you some suggestions that you can take into consideration or not.
Firstly, it is a good idea that the Festival is international.
But in the advertisement it was said that the artists were from all over the world but I saw only six nationalities.
Secondly, the classical concerts were excellent but the halls were so crowded that nobody could walk.
In my opinion, it would be important to rent bigger halls next year.
Thirdly, I noticed that the plays and the films were good entertainment.
They attracted a lot of people and they were really after that.
In conclusion, on the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it.
I have received your letter and thank you for it.
I am very happy to hear from you and I hope that you are well.
, I want to talk first about my school and then about my home.
As you know, I finished school two years ago.
This year, I started a private school in Dijon.
So the rules are clear, you need to participate in the lessons and also pass the exam in June 2000.
In our class, we don't have a problem with students who dislike working, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to stay there for years and years.
It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.
In my home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now.
But when we are out, we have to be careful not to disturb the other people.
It is the same in our family.
For example, my parents dislike hearing music throughout the whole house .
When I go out, they don't give me a time to be home, because I'm sensible.
In conclusion, I don't want to change anything in my house or at school, because I totally agree with the few rules that I have.
I am writing to you about the International Arts Festival which took place on the 21 and 22 November.
I think it is a great idea to have this kind of festival in our region and I really enjoyed most of the events I went to.
However, I feel that it could be even better next year.
In spite of the fact that the classical concerts were really good, I think that some concert halls were too small and so not everybody could appreciate the excellent quality of the music.
Finally, I would like to tell you that the idea of one reasonably priced ticket for the weekend is excellent.
We can go where we want to, see what we feel like seeing.
However, I think the weekend is really too short.
May I suggest you think about doing the festival over a week.
Thanks very much for your letter.
As you asked me in it, here are some of the school and home rules in my country, France.
First of all, and I think it's very different in England, children don't wear uniforms at school.
I was very surprised when I saw them in your country.
It was a bit funny for me.
Of course when you're in class you have to behave yourself and be polite with the teacher and the other schoolchildren.
During the break , usually some teachers stay out and keep an eye on you.
I think nowadays, children are more free and .
I mean as regards the contact between them and adults.
Usually they know what they're allowed to do or not and if they don't respect it, the teacher not only punishes them (though not always) but also speaks with them.
At home it is different.
Each family has its own rules.
As far as I am concerned, when I was a child, I was not allowed to stay up very late with my parents and sometimes I wanted to because I was not tired.
But I was a clever child.
So, usually, at home, like at school, you have to behave yourself but differently, because you're at home so you feel more confident.
There are some rules, like "don't speak with a full mouth"; "don't put your finger in your nose"; "say please and thank you"; "don't fight with your brother"; and so on, but I think it's the same everywhere.
I write you this letter because I want to tell you about my experiences at the festival.
I spent two days at the "International Arts Festival" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some could be better the next time.
For example, on the leaflet it was written that there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries.
That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was and not enough room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small ; I hope it will be larger the next time.
Last, I would like to suggest a "pony-ride" for children, to attract families.
Please tell me your opinion about this.
I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea! But the stars and artists who are from around the world were from only six countries.
You had better invite more nationalities .
And some concert halls were too small, so you had better have larger concert halls and also you had better have more plays and films next year than this year.
I think the idea of one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is excellent, because it is not complex, .
If you can improve these points, your festival will be better than this year's.
My school's rules aren't strict.
We are allowed to do a lot of things.
For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes - whatever we want.
And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom at any time we want.
Of course we can go out of the classroom at any time.
But some schools in my country don't allow a lot of things.
One of the rules at my friend's school is you are not allowed to drink or eat anything during a class.
And the students have to wear uniforms, so they can't choose their clothes.
First , I think we should rent bigger halls so that we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience! If we will offer one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events we can make more people interested.
We can invite stars and artists from around the world who will play and all kinds of music like jazz, rock, classical etc.
It should be done so people can see how people in every corner of the world have fun.
are a good idea too, to explain how the music is made and show how the instruments work.
Afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so they could get to know them personally.
Thank you for your letter.
It was so nice to hear from you again and I am glad you have mentioned this subject.
 What rules do we have in our schools? First of all, it depends what kind of school it is: Primary, high school or university.
I think that now Polish schools are making progress but they still have lots of bad habits.
School is supposed to be our second home but it's not.
We work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing.
You ask me what would I change? I would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and I would give students more chances to share their fantasies at school.
I liked the plays and the films most.
Some films were really wonderful.
You had picked unknown but talented directors' films and they were really worth watching.
And the concerts were also excellent.
In particular, I enjoyed the jazz concerts and could see some famous jazz musicians I adore.
However, I some things which I think I should point out.
Some concert halls were not big enough to hold the audience.
For next year, I think you should take this matter into consideration.
And I think it would be much better if you had more plays and films.
I will definitely go to the festival next year, too.
To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could my comments about it.
There was an old married couple.
They had no children.
One day, the lady went to a river to wash their clothes and the man went to a mountain to cut trees.
In a bamboo forest, he found a shining piece of bamboo.
When he cut it, he found a beautiful baby girl in it.
She was named the bamboo princess.
The princess grew up to be beautiful.
Some princes proposed to her.
But she said to them, "If you want me, you have to do this," and asked them to do impossible things because she didn't want to get married.
One day, the old couple saw the princess crying.
When they asked her about this, she said, "I am from the moon and I will have to go back soon".
They really loved her and they asked a prince who loved the princess to protect her.
But, one day, the princess went back to the moon with guards from the moon although the prince and his army tried hard to protect her.
as most people like dance shows, including me.
That's real knowledge for us, art exhibitions and talks by writers.
I think we will know a writer's life or how he is writing about it.
It's a very significant thing.
Lastly, you said 'one weekend ticket for all events'.
It's excellent.
If you can pay attention to my small suggestion, next year I hope it will be an unbelievable festival.
I miss you very much and sorry I haven't written you any letters.
I hope you forgive me.
What are you doing nowadays? How is your school? My school opened yesterday.
As you know I am a new student.
It is very difficult because I don't know anybody.
However, today I am getting used to my school, I have met two sweet girls.
But this school has got a lot of rules and in our class we have been talking about rules, both at home and at school.
It is very boring.
For instance: you must not argue with your friend or you must not argue with workers.
The most significant rule is you must not smoke in public places, or in the toilet.
You continuously must study hard.
I feel very bad because what you are allowed I am not allowed to do at home.
Do you understand me? Can I change my school? Please will you write me a letter quickly.
I am writing to thank you for the annual international arts festival which was organized on 21st-22nd November.
I spent two days at this festival.
It was a great idea to organize such a festival.
I am a teacher and I love music.
Most of the events which I saw were good.
I enjoyed the dance shows, and the jazz and rock concerts.
I visited art exhibitions.
There were a lot of nice pictures, sculptures and other creative works.
I was impressed by them.
At the festival I could talk with writers.
It was an excellent idea to have one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events.
A lot of people could visit as many events as they wanted.
I was very surprised when I learned that the stars and artists were from only six countries.
It was too few for this festival.
It was a pity that the halls used for the classical concerts were too small.
I like going to classical concerts but at this festival the sound of the music was terrible.
I have some suggestions for next year's festival.
Firstly, it will be great if you invite more famous singers and bands.
The second one is to include more musical films and plays.
I would like to help you in your interesting work.
I look forward to your answer.
There are a lot of folk stories from around the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia.
I would like to tell you one of them.
This story is about a man and his three sons.
This story happened a long time ago.
The man was old and his sons were young.
One day the man quarrelled with his sons and they left the house to try to find work.
They were successful.
And they lived far from their father for two years.
They grew up and became wise.
They decided to return to their father because he was old and he needed help.
I'm writing to you to give my opinion of that great festival you organised last 21 and 22 of November.
I want you to know what an extraordinary time I had with my friends at the festival.
Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world for only that reasonably priced ticket we bought for the whole weekend.
The festival was very well organised with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows.
In my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small.
You have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people.
In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend.
In my house rules practically don't exist because I am 18 years old now so my parents' only wish is that I study for a university degree and be a good man.
They only want to know where I am and when I go out and at what time I came home.
At school it is completely different because the teachers don't forgive you anything.
You have to be quiet and attentive in class if you don't want to be punished.
I'm happy because my parents allow me to do a lot of things.
I wouldn't like to change anything because we all need some discipline to do the right things.
I went to your annual international arts festival.
I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better.
But firstly, I want to congratulate you on organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of event.
Secondly, I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it.
As it said so in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented.
I was quite disappointed.
However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as an oven inside.
The plays and films were good and I liked them, but there were only a few, I hope there will be many more next year.
One of the most positive aspects of your festival is the price of your weekend ticket.
As a student, the low priced ticket certainly attracted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists.
Finally, I would like to make one suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to coming to your festival next year.
One of the best is working in a big supermarket.
Some can find it boring but it is well-paid and not too tiring.
Furthermore, department stores are always looking for students who would like to work.
Another solution could be working as a barman, the problem is that you go to bed very late, but it's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night.
Unfortunately, it's not possible unless you can rest in the morning.
If you are a really good student in one subject, you can provide private lessons, which is one of the most jobs, but do it only if you like teaching.
Otherwise you should try to find another job.
The main thing to remember is that there are many possibilities but you have to try to find them and not just say: "I want to work and earn money".
I would like to congratulate you on your wonderful "Arts Festival".
You had a really great idea to create this sort of festival.
I had a lot of fun there.
I would come next year with great pleasure.
I hope you will not be angry if I give you some advice.
First, I would like to talk about your section "Stars and Artists".
This section is really great and attracts a lot of people.
From my point of view, it will better if you have some "Stars and Artists" from only six countries because the spectators will probably be more interested in your festival if they know the celebrities.
All the sections of your festival were great but I think there were not a lot of "Plays and Films".
I love films and plays also, and I hope to have more films or plays next year.
Concerning the tickets, I think your price is reasonable for this festival.
It is a good idea to have reasonably-priced tickets for weekends.
I'm really happy to receive your letter and I hope you are fine.
I'm fine but I have a lot of work to do for my school.
My exams start next month, that's why I have a lot of work.
In your letter, you wanted to know about my school rules in France and you also wanted to know what I am or I am not allowed to do at home.
Alright, I'm going to answer your questions.
First, you are not allowed to smoke, drink or to take drugs in my school.
You must be outside during the break.
You must your notebook to your parents every week.
You are not allowed to argue with your teacher after you an exam.
You must be on time at school or you get a punishment.
I have so many other rules but these are the most important.
With regard to your International Arts Festival , I would like to share with you the pleasure I had to be part of the event and make some suggestions for next year's festival that you might take into consideration.
The International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea.
I enjoyed most of the events and I found your prices excellent, considering that I am a student and that I do not have much money.
In your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately I found out only six countries were represented.
I would like to suggest that more countries should be part of the festival if it is possible.
It is a very good opportunity to listen to different kinds of music and to discover different cultures.
Hoping that I have not offended you in any way and that you might take into consideration my suggestions, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.
It's a story of a special person who was born in my country and who is now known worldwide.
The night he came into this world was one of  for the inhabitants of the country and also of the town where he was born, it was an ordinary night.
The sky was so clear that the moon and the stars lit up all the land.
Only the ones who knew how to read stars could actually tell that a great king had been born.
When the three men saw him, they fell on their knees to worship him.
The mother was proud because she knew he was sent from above and he was going to be the one to set people free from their sins.
This little man from Israel died as the hero of all times.
His message is still as today and will always be, even if this story happened a long time ago.
I'd like to say something that I felt during the festival, and give my opinions that would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival .
First of all, I congratulate you for organizing such an exciting festival.
It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself at this festival very much.
By the way, according to the advertisement, lots of stars and artists from around the world were supposed to be invited for the festival, but I was able to meet them from only six countries.
And another thing is that some concert halls were too small, so when I went there for Jazz and rock concerts it was so crowded, and during the concerts people felt suffocated.
I hope you'll get much bigger concert halls next year.
On the other hand, the plays and films were excellent.
I expect that much more varied kinds of plays and films will be on next year.
Finally, I'd like to mention the reasonably-priced weekend ticket.
It was brillient, because if I had to pay for all things individually I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.
Thank you very much for that.
A long time ago, there were two brothers, whose parents were dead.
Their parents were rich, so when they passed away they left a lot of money.
By the way, the elder brother, Nolbu was a very greedy man.
He didn't want to share the money with his brother, Hungbu, so he took all of the money, and said to Hungbu to go away from the house without anything.
Hungbu had nothing but his family of twelve.
But, even if he was very poor, he was very good and had a lot of affection for the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them.
One cold day, Hungbu saw a bird that had a broken wing, so the bird couldn't fly to the warmer country during the winter.
He cured the bird with love, and the bird was able to fly.
The following year, when the bird returned to his house, he gave him a message.
It was a kind of map that showed the location of a lot of money which robbers hid.
People believe that the bird was sent from heaven.
I am writing to you to give you some opinions of mine about The International Arts Festival.
3.
I don't think that there were enough plays and films.
To sum up I want to tell you about my suggestions for next year's festival.
It would be wonderful to buy some books or programmes with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival.
Also I think that the dance shows should include different styles of dancing (e.g.
the national dance of all the countries) to impress the audience and .
I have just got your letter.
It is a pleasure for me to keep in touch with such a friend as you are.
Thank you very much.
2.
One should have such marks as ,,3", ,,4", ,,5", not ,,2", which is .
These rules are strict and certainly we have an endless number of rules.
I don't think you will be interested in them.
Honestly speaking I am not sure about home rules.
I think that in our family everything is based on mutual understanding.
We don't have old-fashioned rules or anything like that.
I am writing to express my profound gratitude for the excellent organisation of the annual international arts festival, where I spent two days.
The idea of such a festival is really magnificent and I enjoyed various art exhibitions, talks by writers and dance shows.
However, the festival could be even better next year.
Actually, there were stars and artists from six countries and it would be wonderful if you could invite artists from some others places as well for next year's festival.
Also, I was fascinated by the plays and films and you could probably organize some more.
Unfortunately, I am afraid that some concert halls where jazz, rock and classical concerts were held were too small and perhaps you could arrange to use bigger ones.
To start with I would like to say that books offer us a wide range of different life stories, both realistic and unusual, they make us thoughtful and form our outlook, and they make us feel and think.
As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction as each masterpiece is unique in its own way regardless of what sort of book it is.
Stories that are realistic help us to understand our own life and the people around us better.
However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view.
I consider "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday routine.
It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death.
This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality.
It contributes to the world's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination.
In conclusion, I'd like to mention that we should value realistic and fantastical stories equally if we are eager to get to understand the world and ourselves.
I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea.
I spent two nice days watching its events.
I was there with my boyfriend.
We have similar interests but we have different opinions.
For me - the dance shows were absolutely wonderful.
I like dancing and I like watching dance shows.
The dancers wore nice clothes, and the music was very good.
Unfortunately there were no Spanish dancers.
I prefer them to others.
Maybe next year? You should invite artists from more countries.
We also listened to the concerts but in our opinion the concert halls were too small.
During the jazz and rock concerts the audience wants to play and dance so they need more room.
I like listening to classical music in the big halls, too.
My boyfriend was excited about the art exhibitions and listening to the writers.
He was happy because he was able to talk to them in person.
We had no time to watch all the plays and films.
We chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably priced ticket for all the events because we could change our plans during the event.
I suggest organizing the next IAF in the summer.
We are both students so we have our holiday from July to September.
We have more free time in the summer.
We would attend the IAF any time, as well.
I'd like to write about rules in Poland.
They're horrible.
There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school.
First of all - we have to be on time.
Our lessons start at 8 am and we aren't allowed to be late.
We have to change our shoes.
Fortunately we don't have to wear school uniforms.
We can wear what we want.
Most students wear jeans and a sweater.
We have to be quiet during lessons and our lessons are boring because of it.
Our school bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day.
This is what I'd like to change.
I'd like to leave my books at school.
At home we have to do our homework.
There's always much to do so we have no free time at all.
Our parents want us to be clever.
When we get good marks at school they let us go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten).
On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning.
We sometimes help in the house but it isn't compulsory.
We aren't allowed to smoke or drink any alcohol.
We aren't allowed to argue with our parents and teachers.
This is also horrible.
We mustn't talk to them but must only listen to them.
I'd like to change that.
Student life is hard but sometimes funny.
I went to your annual international art festival.
Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year.
So, I am writing to you with some of my opinions and suggestions.
I hope it might help with next year's festival.
The idea of an "International Art Festival" was great.
But I feel the word "International" was not really suitable; because you only had six countries' stars and artists .
I think you should invite more than ten countries.
The other problem was , as the hall of the classical concert was too small and crowded.
Next year, you should calculate or how many people will come before you choose a hall, .
And the offer of a "weekend ticket" was an excellent idea, because .
Looking forward to next year's festival.
One day, a little girl called Sara was walking over a bridge.
Suddenly, she heard a man's voice calling her: "Sara...Sara..
look down to the river." Then Sara looked into the river.
She was very scared, because she saw a golden fish who was smiling at her and talking to her.
After a few seconds, Sara felt that the golden fish was lovely.
She had never seen any fish that had that wonderful colour and could talk with her.
Because Sara didn't have any brothers and sisters, and her Mom and Dad needed to work every day, she was very lonely.
Therefore, she came to the river every day and talked about everything with the golden fish.
They were very close friends.
After half a year, the golden fish suddenly disappeared.
Sara was very sad.
She sat and cried by the river.
Then somebody called her name: "Sara...
Sara...
look at me...
I'm standing on your left-hand side." Sara remembered the golden fish.
It had suddenly become human, a little boy.
After a few days they got married.
They had a wonderful life together.
I am writing about the International Arts Festival, which I went to recently.
I had a great time there because is very unusual.
I think that the International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful.
I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out at the weekend due to my working on the weekdays I had time to go and did not have to worry about the ticket price.
In spite of having a great time, there were some things I would like to give you my opinion about.
Firstly, there were a few stars and artists from only six countries although the advertisement mentioned that stars and artists would come from around the world.
Secondly, some concerts took place in really small halls.
I suggest that concerts should be held in bigger halls than this year's next year.
Then, there would be more people coming to the concerts.
Finally, should be added to this festival next year because .
Hello.
How are you doing? I've also been thinking about rules at home with my friends.
Isn't it quite interesting to talk about rules? At home I'm not allowed to talk on the phone more than ten minutes, which annoys me very much.
I really want to change this.
However, I can go out whenever I want, even at midnight.
I'm also allowed to come home anytime so that I can chat with my friends for a long time instead of talking on the phone at home.
There are a lot of rules at my school.
Firstly, we're allowed to drive a car to school, which is quite an unusual rule in a Japanese school because students might crash a car on the way to school or home.
I actually love this rule because I don't have to get up early if I have a car.
Secondly, boys are not allowed to have long hair.
They have to cut their hair once a month.
Girls can't have make-up on at school at all.
I want to at least put lipstick on.
I wish I could change this rule.
I'll be glad if you let me know about your rules at school and at home.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
I am writing in order to give my opinions about the annual International Arts Festival I have attended.
First of all, I have to say that the idea of such a festival is great.
It gives an opportunity to get acquainted with the cultural variety of the whole world.
However, at this festival there were artists from only six countries, whereas the advertisement promised stars from around the world.
Despite that, all the jazz, rock and classical concerts were extremely enjoyable, although some concert halls were too small for all the guests of the festival.
Another disadvantage of the festival's programme was the lack of plays and films which are the best to display a modern country's culture, I think.
I hope there will be more of them next year.
I must also admit the organization of the festival was perfect.
All the guests were offered a weekend ticket for all events.
That was an excellent decision as all the events started at different times and there were plenty of them.
In addition, it was reasonably-priced.
In conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of the success of the festival some improvements still can be made.
For example, next year's one could last not for two days only, but for a week.
So it will be available for a greater number of people.
The programme could also be improved by adding new categories such as folk songs.
Of course, young people can work only in their spare time.
It means that a job should be part-time.
So, one opportunity is working as a baby-sitter.
This job doesn't demand much ability, but a lot of patience though.
In addition to baby-sitting, you may also give some lessons to small children such as (tl) teaching them to read or write or just basic rules and words of a foreign language, English, for example.
Another way to earn some money is to work as a waiter after classes.
This job requires a lot of energy, however.
But you can earn more.
Furthermore, it's possible to work abroad during a holiday.
But if you don't like children and are not easy-going enough to work as a waiter you may choose the more peaceful job of a typist at home.
There are a lot of people not willing to type essays and reports themselves or just not having a computer.
So, you can help them and earn .
To sum up, there is no problem without a solution and if you are an active and broad-minded person, you will surely find a way to earn money even in the Arctic.
I am writing to describe the fun that I had at the International Arts Festival last week.
Firstly, I want to say that this festival is really good and I hope it will happen every year.
Furthermore, the events, such as the shows, exhibitions and concerts, were beautiful.
I liked all the different kinds of atmosphere.
Also, for all these attractions, the price was low and that is important for a big family.
Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous.
However, I was disappointed by the number of them.
It would be great if there were more choice next year.
I would like to give you a suggestion about the size of the concert rooms.
Considering the crowd, there should be more rooms.
Finally, I would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only European artists.
In conclusion, I had an unforgettable time.
I would like to eat some different kind of food, if that is possible.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I'm very happy to receive some news from you.
I'm going to reply to your question.
, at school we haven't so many rules.
, we aren't allowed to smoke inside - or eat in the classroom.
We have to wash the board when it's our turn.
Of course, we must respect the teacher and do what he says.
What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, so I can do what I want.
I know that I had to ask my Mum or Dad about going out with my friend after school.
They wanted me to do my homework before going out to play.
Also, I had to come back home on time.
It was very important for my parents.
I didn't want to change anything.
I was happy.
Anyway, it was a great time when I was a child.
That's all for now.
I am writing to tell you about the festival this time and I would like to suggest to you three things for the next festival.
First of all, it is a great idea to have this kind of festival.
I enjoyed it so much.
But, there are three things which I would like to tell you.
Firstly, there were stars and artists from only six countries.
I expected to see a variety of nationalities.
Secondly, I actually liked the Jazz, rock and classical concerts very much.
However, some concert halls were too small for the large number of people so we couldn't have a enough space.
Thirdly, I would like you to consider having more plays and films next year.
It would be nicer.
Otherwise, the price was really reasonable for all the weekend events.
I was satisfied with that.
And if there was musical event, it would be great.
I hope the next one will be better.
And I would like to thank you for organising this festival.
I look forward to the next festival very much.
Let me tell you some rules at school in my country.
Actually, we have quite strict rules.
When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes.
And we couldn't wear any colourful clothes and socks.
Also our hairstyle was the same for everyone.
It's really strict.
At home, there is one thing I'd like to change.
I'm not allowed to sleep at my friend's house.
I really like chatting all night with my friends.
But I can't do it.
I'm persuading my mum, perhaps.
The school rules in my country are more strict than in your country.
Anyway, if you want to know about something of our country, I'm glad to tell you more.
I am writing in response to your advertisement in today's newspaper.
I recently spent two days at the International Arts Festival and I found it very entertaining.
It was a really good idea to organize a festival containing such different shows.
The idea that I liked the most was the reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events because a lot of students and unemployed people could not afford to pay too much money.
I went to see a classical concert and, although the music played was excellent, the concert hall was too small.
Furthermore, I had expected stars and artists from around the world, but they came from only six countries.
A friend of mine went to see the play "Hamlet" and the film "Gladiators".
He told me how great they were and I was thinking that it would be good to have more plays and films next year.
In addition to this, I was wondering if you could organize the same festival in the summer.
Two sisters, Alex and Daniela, were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking about what they could do.
That year, the winter in France was very cold.
It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found a present for their mother.
Giving Christmas presents was a tradition not to be forgotten and there were only four days left.
Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present.
Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk in this kind of weather.
Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister.
After forty minutes, the weather became very bad.
It was such a pain to walk in the snow.
However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold.
within herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it.
Unfortunately, Daniela fainted.
She was so cold that she couldn't move her legs.
Alex began to cry and to pray and when Daniela was about to die an angel appeared.
He asked Alex if it was more important to take a present back home or to save her sister.
The answer was obvious and the angel saved Daniela.
This story happened a long time ago.
I was impressed with the idea of the festival.
I could enjoy different cultures and also I could expand my knowledge.
Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday.
The ticket price was not too expensive for a student too.
However, you said "Stars and artists from around the world" in the advertisement.
But there were only six countries' candidates.
It was exaggerated.
Besides, some concert halls were too small.
Jazz and classical concert halls were especially small.
It caused a long queue and I had to waste my time.
Except for these two things, it was quite good.
I'd like to suggest this - concerning plays and films.
Plays and films were good, there weren't enough.
In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that.
In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival.
I'd like to tell you about my experiences.
Before that, you have to think about why you need to earn money and how you do that.
It is really important because making money needs a proper purpose.
Firstly, I did newspaper delivery.
I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far more than pocket money.
Nevertheless, I lost my concentration on my studies and I spent the money on entertainment.
I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time.
I was only 12 years old.
Secondly, I made a brochure for a company when I was in high school.
I was studying computers at that time.
Also I was leader of the computer-user circle in the school so I needed some money for managing the circle.
For this reason, I took this kind of part-time job in the company.
Despite the fact that it was a part-time job, I worked very hard because I liked computer work.
I could earn money, and I also got a career.
Finally, I worked for a factory during the last winter holiday.
It was also hard, but I think that was an easy way to make money.
I forgot many skills and knowledge during the time.
So the loss was bigger than the profit.
In conclusion, if you want to earn a bit of money, then you have to choose a proper part-time job.
Because you will get some money as well as some career and knowledge.
You must consider the purpose too.
If you haven't a purpose, you will waste money easily and quickly.
I am writing with reference to the International Arts Festival which I have recently been to and I would like to give you my opinions about it.
According to the title of the advertisement, which was a great idea, there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six countries.
In addition to this, some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there for the occasion and, personally speaking, I think the show could be done in the open air next year, so that the music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.
The plays and films were a great success and I would like to ask if there will be more next year because in my opinion people would appreciate it.
The other events I went to, dance shows, art exhibitions and talks by writers, were well-organised and extremely interesting.
Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was an excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part in the Festival.
I'm writing to answer your question about the rules in my life, at school and at home.
As you may know, I attend a Liceo, which is the most kind of high school in Italy.
Our teachers are very strict, we have to stand up as they come into class and wait until they say ôDo sit down!".
We can't talk during lessons and we only have a ten-minute break at 10.30 a.m.
If we're late, we have to go to the principal and ask for his signature to go to class.
It's hard to be extremely quiet for five hours but I reckon it's a good method of education.
On the other hand, I feel free at home.
I help doing the cleaning or the washing, but I do it because I want to, not because my parents make me do it.
I can go out and stay out late, I've got my car and my mobile, so that they can call me whenever they need to speak to me; but above all I know they trust me and consider me an adult.
Therefore I wouldn't change anything in my home life or in my school life.
I am writing to give suggestions regarding the international art festival, which I went to one week ago.
It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year.
The last thing is about the ticket.
It was excellent to have one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events, because it is convenient and normally young people do not have a lot of money, so I hope next year the ticket will also be like this.
I'm very glad to hear from you.
I hope everything is ok.
I'm really sorry I didn't write back to you immediately, because I was preparing my exam at that moment, so can you forgive me? We should keep in touch with each other, because you know I'm very happy to have a friend like you.
In your last letter you asked me something about our rules, both at home and at school in my country.
I'd like to tell you that, in school, we have lots of rules, especially in class and some of them are quite strange.
For example, we can't go to the toilet during lessons.
We have to go there in the break.
And we can't eat food or do any sports in our classroom.
If you fail three subjects in your exam, you will be kicked out of school.
It's too strict.
I don't like it.
If I could, I would like to change this, because I don't think everyone can succeed at once.
We should give them a second chance to succeed.
Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents.
For me, I don't have rules at home - I just don't make trouble for my family.
That's all.
.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
All the best and good luck.
The purpose of this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival I attended last weekend.
I believe that the event was good.
However, I feel that the festival could be improved next year.
Firstly, I would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an International Arts Festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that I would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries.
I do understand that it must be difficult to get these people to come to the festival, but it would be nice if next year we could meet some other personalities.
Secondly, I believe you should know that a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small.
I would be very grateful if you could tell me if there will be more plays and films next year.
Last but not least, I would like you to know that I think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately.
I hope you find my opinions useful.
Once again, congratulations on the Festival.
When the holidays begin everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem for most of us.
There are several ways to earn a bit of money in your spare time.
One of the most common examples is babysitting.
Taking care of little children is easy and it doesn't require special skills: all you need is a lot of patience.
If looking after children doesn't suit you, you can try the same thing with pets.
Lots of people would pay you to take their dog for a walk.
So if you like animals this is your chance to earn some money and have fun at the same time.
The most important thing is that you choose the most suitable work for you wisely, according to the things you like to do.
I recently spent two days at the International Arts Festival and I am writing in order to give my opinions about it.
When I found out there was going to be an international festival, I got really excited because I would finally have the opportunity to meet stars and artists from around the world, but I felt rather disappointed when I found out that was not at all true.
Besides this, I think that some of the concert halls were too small so that I felt very uncomfortable.
However, the one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all the events was marvellous because I was able to attend as many concerts as I wished without spending much money.
Although that Festival was not well organized, I would like you to repeat it next year.
I wish you could show more plays and films, and there should be more varied art exhibitions.
But I would really appreciate it if you took into consideration the problem with the lack of space in the concert halls.
I hope you consider these suggestions.
It is really nice to hear from you and I think we will learn so many interesting facts from each other.
Personally, I cannot imagine human life without rules, especially those that have to do with respecting other people.
Moreover, I am in favour of rules at school because it is very important for children to learn how to cooperate with others.
As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing suitable clothes, arriving on time and getting on with every teacher and authority figure.
As a consequence, most schoolmates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them.
I congratulate you because it was a great idea and the town needed a cultural event.
I especially appreciated the weekend tickets which almost everybody could afford, even students like me.
However, I think that some concert halls were too small for the musical performances.
You probably did not expect such a big audience! Being very fond of films, I would have appreciated seeing more of them.
For next year's festival, you could possibly add some foreign films, like Chinese ones, which I like most.
Finally, in order to make it a really international festival, I think you should invite artists from all over the world, not just from six countries like this year.
Are you young and full of life but don't have enough money to enjoy your spare time? Simply let your brain work and you could come up with wonderful ideas to earn money enjoying yourself.
Are you fed up with looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend.
I am writing in response to the International Arts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November.
I would like to inform you that it was a great idea and a activity as a social event.
However, it was a disappointment when I realised that not many countries were attending the event.
I would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance, the Far East, Indonesia etc.
It wasn't difficult to find the right hall for the shows, I would say it was very well organised.
But one thing I have to mention is that some of the concert halls were too small and they weren't comfortable either, and this spoiled the great atmosphere.
On the other hand, I enjoyed being one of the people seeing the plays films, the dance shows which were brilliantly performed and the art exhibitions.
Listening to talks by famous writers was an opportunity which I couldn't miss.
I would like to ask if you could extend the plays and films next year? I have to add that the weekend ticket was a great idea to all the events.
Finally, I appreciate your and look forward to hearing about the next International Arts Festival.
I must say that our school rules are quite different to yours.
First of all we have to stand up when we speak to the teacher and have to pay full attention to the lessons.
If you miss a lesson, that could cause a problem for you.
I think it depends on the school.
Private schools have a more relaxed atmosphere than the state schools.
They don't have strict rules and students can take extra lessons.
On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviour is punished.
For example, you have to do more homework or they send you home etc.
Of course smoking isn't allowed in any part of the school.
I have a relaxed family and we share all the housework.
My father does the cooking, my mother does the cleaning and I tidy up! But in many families, women do more than men.
I can't accept that, because you have to share all the duties and spend more time together.
Anyway, I think that's it for now.
I hope to hear from you soon.
I'm an Italian boy who went to the International Arts Festival last November and I enjoyed most of the events I went to, but because I think that the Festival could be better next year I am writing to you in order to let you hear some observations of mine about the festival.
The festival on its own is a great idea because there aren't many of these events dealing with art but I think that instead of inviting stars and artists from only six counties they could be invited from all over the world.
Furthermore, and certainly it is not your fault, some of the halls for the concerts were too small and that prevented me from enjoying some of the concerts because of the noise but also prevented many people from entering the hall, which was often too crowded.
I hope next year there will be more play and films and that the ticket will be reasonably priced .
I'm going to write about rules in my country and I have to tell you that life in school isn't too hard because even if there are a lot of rules to follow nobody does .
It's written in the regulations that we can't leave the school during the breaks; we can't smoke near the classrooms; we have to justify our absences or lateness and even if you're over eighteen your parents have to you with the teacher.
Even if my parents don't like going out at night or studying you shouldn't think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends over for a Saturday night party.
Although your advertisement said there would be stars and artists from around the world, I was able to see artists from only six countries.
Additionally, some concert halls were too small to relax in, though most of them were very comfortable.
It was a pity for me that there were fewer plays and films than I had expected.
I suggest that you should organise more next year.
On the other hand, there was a lot that impressed me very much.
For example, there was one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events.
It is a very good way to increase the number of music-lovers.
Last but not least, I would like to thank you for devoting yourself to making this festival wonderful every year.
I enjoyed it very much.
Long long ago, there lived in the province of Bizen in Japan an old woman and an old man.
They were eager to have a child, but they had never been able to.
One day, the woman went to the riverside, and found a peach floating in the river.
She took it to her house, cutting it in two, with her husband.
To their surprise, there was a boy in the peach! They named him Momotaro, and looked after him.
The boy had grown and had become very strong when he heard that there were lots of devils on Onigashima Island who robbed many people in Bizen of a lot of money and a lot of treasure.
He made up his mind to defeat them, and asked his stepmother for some kibidango, one of traditional snacks in Japan.
Having eaten the kibidango, he departed for Onigashima with three friends of his: a dog, a monkey and a bird.
Reaching the island, he and his friends fought bravely against the devils.
They finally succeeded in defeating the devils, and took back all the money and treasure.
After that, they went home.
All the people in Bizen including his stepparents received Momotaro and his friends with great joy.
I think the International Arts Festival is a great idea, because you can see how other countries' art is, but I think in this festival, there were .
You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small so that the people couldn't even dance at classical concerts.
What do you think about picking five people and giving them tickets for 'Art Travel'? I think this is a good idea.
Generally it was very good and I hope more people will come next year.
First of all I would like to say that organising an International Arts Festival was a great idea.
I enjoyed it and found it worth visiting.
The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with stars and artists coming from around the world.
Although this was true, they were from only six countries.
You could have let us get acquainted with more cultures by inviting guests from some other countries too.
The concert halls were not big enough to let all the guests in.
So I could hardly attend all of the concerts.
The organisation was very good.
I found chances to see dance shows, art exhibitions and to listen to writers, but there could be more plays and films next year.
It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me, but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year.
Then it would be excellent.
I have received your letter.
It is nice to hear from you again.
I'm in a hurry, so I will come directly to the point.
Everywhere and at every time in our lives we are faced with rules.
Some view them as a source of protection of their rights and others as a limitation of them.
For me they are both.
At school we have certain rules like being in the class, sitting in your place before the lecture starts, bringing in your equipment with you, keeping quiet during the lessons and raising your hand when you want to talk.
I think these are international rules which help things to progress in order.
On the other hand there are other rules which annoy us like the ones .
You should wear the same things every time, no changes and alternations are allowed.
It makes us like robots and we feel bad psychologically, because we want to be different and free in what we wear.
Also the attendance rules put a strain on us.
If we don't come to school for 10 days, then we can't pass the course.
They don't care if we have problems, exams to study for or if we are ill.
At home we again have rules, but more flexible ones.
You should be punctual when coming to the dining table, respectful, do your homework and watch TV less and not too loud.
I would like to change the attendance and clothing rules in school, but I don't have enough power.
They are against democracy I think.
I am writing to thank you for arranging the International Arts Festival.
It was an absolutely great idea.
Firstly, could you invite stars and artists from more than only six countries? In my opinion, it might be better to have time with a variety of nationalities.
Secondly, the music concerts were very exciting and I had a lot of fun, but some concert halls were too small to enjoy them comfortably.
Thirdly, I am expecting to watch more films and plays, which were impressive.
Lastly, it could be nice for students who are interested in the arts, if you offer special events, for instance, a song contest, writing competition or dance lessons.
To sum up, I hope the festival is organised next year with excellent reasonably-priced tickets like this year's.
Do you need money? If you do, why you want to earn money.
That is very important to find a way of earning and saving money.
Probably the best way you can get money is to have a part-time job in your spare time.
I am recommending you check your possible time to work - weekdays or weekend? - before you apply for a job.
I would like to make some comments about the event that I went to.
First of all, the concert hall is too small to have a great concert.
I think it should be bigger for jazz, rock or even classical concerts.
- talks by writers to say how good his latest book is.
In addition, the tickets are too expensive and it is difficult to buy a new one every day.
So, I think it would be more effective if there was one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.
In conclusion, I believe it will be better next year if these points are observed better than before.
How are you? It was nice to get some news about you.
I remember this time in our class when we were talking for a long time about rules and .
Firstly, I think the International Arts Festival is a wonderful idea because I have the opportunity to enjoy different arts events.
But it is also true I could just see stars and artists on stage from only six countries, not stars from around the world as you said in your advertisement.
Secondly, I really enjoyed the jazz and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some of them took place in too small concert halls.
Thirdly, all the plays and films shown were interesting.
In my opinion you should include some more films and plays in your festival next year.
Finally, I think it was a good idea buying only one ticket for all the events since I spent the time watching and enjoying all of them.
I look forward to hearing from you.
As you told me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home.
First, I must tell you that the teachers are strict at school.
We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down at individual desks.
We can't chat with our classmates.
How boring! At home everything is quite good, because mum and dad are great but there's one main rule: I must tell them where I am going and what time I'll come back.
Granny is the problem because she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kinds of clothes I should wear but I don't take any notice of her.
I am writing to give my opinion about the International Arts Festival which was held on 21st and 22nd November.
I went to the rock concert by U2 and to see the Chinese film "Chung King Express".
Both of them were not only really enjoyable, but also reasonably priced.
However, I feel that it would be even better if there were some improvement.
First of all, it would be better if there were more famous people of various nationalities, because most of them were from English-speaking countries this year.
In addition, larger halls should be provided for concerts since a lot of people could not get tickets for those by big stars.
Moreover, personally, I hope that the number of plays and films will increase.
I think they are the 'arts' in real life.
I would be glad if you considered my suggestions.
Money - hasn't it always been one of the most important problems for students? Of course, you can't afford a luxury car and a large apartment unless you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth.
However, there are some good ways for you to earn enough money to enjoy yourself.
How about working as a waiter or waitress? Not only is it a simple job, but also you can enjoy working with a lot of colleagues your age.
It would be great fun to make friends outside your class or club.
If you say that the wage is far from satisfactory, why don't you teach younger students as a private teacher.
It's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salary.
If you are interested in teaching and responsible enough, you'll probably become an excellent teacher.
I saw your advertisement in "the Sun" newspaper on 10th November, and I went to the festival last Friday.
Most of the events were wonderful and well organised.
I enjoyed it, but I think it could be even better next year, so I would like to give my view of it.
Firstly, the idea of holding this International Arts Festival is great.
It allowed people to enjoy their weekend, relax , and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening their knowledge.
In addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10.
This was excellent.
It meant people only spent , and then they could watch all the events at the weekend.
For them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
So my friends told me that this was their cheapest weekend.
Moreover, the stars and artists were from only six countries.
In my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more interesting, and in my opinion, some of the concert halls were too small.
The people in there couldn't even go to the loo, because it was too crowded.
Finally, the plays and films were wonderfully , as far as I'm concerned.
If you can have more plays and films, it will have a good effect.
These are only my immature views.
If , I will be very pleased.
Thank you very much.
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply.
I was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday.
You asked me about rules, both in my home and at my school.
I am very happy to tell you about this.
At my school, we aren't allowed to smoke inside the building, because the building is made of wood.
It tends to catch fire easily, and we aren't allowed to use the Internet.
There are only ten computers in the school.
Only teachers can use them.
If we used them, we would be sent to the head office of the school.
What is the weather like in England.
I hope it isn't too wet.
Please give my regards to your parents.
Recently I visited an arts festival organized with your help.
I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of it is great.
However, I have some proposals for its improvement next year.
First, I suggest you invite stars and artists not from all over the world, but from only six countries.
This change will give the opportunity to .
My second proposition is about the classical concerts.
I think that some concert halls are too small, so you should be sure about  in advance.
This year I noticed that there were only a few plays and films.
From my point of view, there should be more films because this part of the festival is interesting for people.
And, finally, I should congratulate you on the decision to have one weekend ticket for all events.
I support this idea which is convenient both for the public and the organisers.
I am looking forward to the festival next year.
Thanks for your letter and postcard.
It was really nice .
The things you wrote about in your letter are quite familiar for me, because we, at the moment, have some problems with our rules.
First, about school.
I'm really fed up with our school uniform! It is awful! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it.
That's why our headmaster is really angry.
Of course, if we had a pretty uniform like yours, we would wear it with pleasure.
But it's impossible at the moment.
What should I say to you about home...
We are quite a friendly family, that's why we actually don't have any special rules.
However, we promised our parents to do some cleaning every week.
This is all I wanted to write to you about rules.
I'm looking forward to seeing you next summer after my exams.
Write to me what you think about it.
With regard to the annual international arts festival which took place on 21 and 22nd November 2000, I spent a tremendous two days enjoying some .
Then, I discovered some and I am writing to give my suggestions and recommendations.
Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there was some variety of there.
Next, one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also a fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything with that ticket.
However, according to my notes, there are some doubts about the festival.
While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were in fact only from six countries.
The number of plays and films was also very small.
In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts.
On balance, I feel that this annual festival can be even better next year.
Therefore, I strongly recommend that you should artists and stars from more than six countries and build larger concert halls.
I also suggest that more plays and films should .
I would be happy to support you providing that you want to make the festival more successful.
Thanks for your letter.
It was great to hear from you.
I know you're well, but I've been very busy studying because I have to take an exam next month.
So this is a quick note to tell you what you want to know, as you asked about school rules and house ones.
At school, the most horrible one is about the school uniform.
I really hate it, because we're not allowed to wear casual and fashionable clothes, colourful shoes or colourful socks.
Also we can't change our hair colour and have to keep our hair length above our eyebrows.
Next, we're not allowed to get driver's licences which are for a motorbike and car as long as we're students.
We're also not allowed to get part-time jobs.
If possible, I want to change all of them.
However, at home I'm quite free.
I just can't go out after 9 o'clock at night and I'm not allowed to play computer games for over two hours.
These rules are not so strict that I can't stand them.
I don't think I want to change them.
Anyway, that's all the information about me which you want.
Write soon.
I look forward to hearing from you.
I am writing to suggest some ideas for the International Arts Festival next year.
I have just been there and thought of some improvements which could make the festival better.
First of all, the festival was a great idea.
There were a number of stars and artists from around the world, but only from six countries.
Secondly, they held some concerts, but some of the concert halls were so small that there was not enough space for all the people.
Thirdly, it was nice to see several plays and films.
We would be pleased if you could have more.
Fourthly, everyone seems to have enjoyed seeing the dance shows and the art exhibitions and listening to the talks.
Lastly, the weekend ticket was excellent because it was quite reasonable.
However, a ticket for each event is expensive.
I suggest you have a one-day ticket or a reasonably priced ticket for every event.
That is everything I have thought of concerning the festival.
I would be grateful if you could think about it.
Thank you for your letter.
I really enjoyed reading it.
I'm very happy to know you're well.
I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate you on the organization.
I am also writing to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion about next year's festival.
An international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last there were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
In my opinion some concert halls were too small.
I could not listen to one of my favourite classical , "La Moldava" by Smetana.
Most of the plays and films were brilliant but I think that if there is enough money, it would be better to have the opportunity to watch more movies.
I am glad to tell you that one reasonably priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because people who do not have a lot of money can enjoy the festival.
I would like to make a suggestion.
I think that meeting writers, dancers, musicians and artists should be very interesting for anybody.
Thank you very much for your recent letter.
I'm very happy that you are well.
When I read your letter I was surprised because I didn't know that you had so many rules both at school and at home.
In Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
Nobody should be late in the morning because it is important to respect your classmates' and teachers' effort to get up early.
Nobody is allowed to speak to a friend during the lesson.
I can't have my mobile on and drinking and eating in the classroom is bad manners.
There isn't any kind of punishment for people who do these things.
My parents are very good.
The most important thing for my parents is that I don't tell them lies.
It's important for them that I tell them where I'm going if I go out and what time I think I'll be coming back home.
I can do what I like doing but I have to study.
This is the only condition regarding doing what I want.
I saw the advertisement for the International Arts Festival which is a great idea.
I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival.
I saw in the advertisement there would be stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries represented.
It would be better if there were more than six countries.
I noticed that some concert halls were too small.
I wonder if you could organise outdoor concerts.
Furthermore, I think there were too few plays and films.
Don't you think you could provide drama courses? Visitors could plays with professionals.
Firstly, at school, if we missed a class, we must bring a doctor's note.
Furthermore, when we fail an exam in June, we can take it in September.
And if we are interested, we can spend six months abroad but we must pass the FCE.
At home, we must wash our hands before lunch.
And we mustn't speak during lunch.
I think it's not a good thing because we can't discuss with our family.
There are so many rules but it would take too long if I had to explain all of them.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
I went to the "International Arts Festival" on 21-22 November.
The festival was generally good but I have some suggestions for next year's festival.
Firstly I want to congratulate you on the festival.
It was a great idea.
However there were things that I didn't like.
You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there were only stars from six major countries.
I suggest you increase this number for next year.
In this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures.
Another thing that I want to point out is, the concert halls are too small.
Some people couldn't get into the hall and they missed the concerts.
There were some plays and films.
They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? The last thing that I will say is "one reasonably-priced weekend ticket" was a very good idea.
I hope you will do the same thing next year.
These are my suggestions.
I hope you will listen to my suggestions.
This will make the festival better.
I hope we will meet next year at the festival.
I was glad to see your letter.
I'm fine thanks and my parents are also well.
How are you and your parents? I hope they are both well.
I have recently taken part in your International Arts Festival.
I enjoyed it and here are some and advice for next year.
First of all, it was a great idea to put together different countries to organise this festival.
However, there were only artists from six countries, not as written in your advertisement.
Another excellent thing was your choice for the .
That was a great idea to have just one ticket for all events.
That was simpler than the other way of selling tickets (practical and ).
Mark and his family decided to go for a walk in the Alps.
So, his father prepared the car and his mother took some food for the journey.
It was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited.
He was very keen on going to the mountains.
Suddenly, the father stopped and said: "Here we are!" They were near a little house built of wood and began walking.
The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family.
They ate with the owner of the little house, whose name was John.
It was very quiet because they were in the countryside; they could just hear the cows and John's two dogs.
Mark was very interested in building small things with John.
He was able to make different objects out of wood.
After that, Mark's father, who spoke fluent traditional Swiss language, spent time with an old woman he had just met near the house.
After eating old cheese and Swiss chocolate, it was high time Mark's family went back home.
Mark was so happy but very exhausted to this story.
Nevertheless this story happened a long time ago.
I went to London for a holiday last week and read the advertisement about 'Over the rainbow' in the hotel which I stayed in.
I saw Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were written on the advertisement paper and was very excited.
However, Danny Brook did not appear on the stage until the end of musical showing time.
I was really disappointed about it.
Secondly, the starting time was 19:30 but it started 20:15 so I was waiting for 45 minutes.
It was such a long time to wait in the theatre.
Thirdly, it mentioned about discounts.
Despite the fact that I am a student, I could not get any discounts.
I also visited your restaurant after the show but it was already closed because the show finished late.
For the reasons above, I, indeed, spent an awful last night in London.
I would like you to refund, otherwise, I will take action.
I look forward to receiving a reply to my enquiry.
People will wear this kind of clothes 100 years from now.
When it's very cold in winter, we just wear light clothes , in our style.
Because special warm and healthy material will be developed and used inside thin clothes so we don't need to put heavy clothes on our bodies.
We can show our figure in winter as well.
Most important thing is that we don't have to kill animals just for people's cruel aims.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
After two days, the whole school knew.
When Paul entered the school gate, other children began to tease him and laugh.
Paul couldn't stand it.
He ran out quickly, leaving everyone behind.
He felt very ashamed and didn't know what to do.
Normally, he would go and talk to Pat but Pat betrayed him.
They were no longer friends.
'How could he,' Paul thought 'Now the whole school knows Jean attracts me'.
As he was sitting there, he heard someone walking towards him.
He turned around and saw...
Jean.
'What are you doing here? Why aren't you at school?' she asked.
Paul was paralyzed.
He couldn't reply.
'I heard what you've said about me', she said, I think it's sweet'.
Paul couldn't believe his ears.
While he was thinking how to reply, Jean took his hand and led him to the school.
When they entered everyone became silent.
All the children were staring at them and Paul thought that Pat wasn't that bad at all.
I would like to complain about a musical show.
I was very disappointed during a week's holiday because I had a lot of problems with the show.
I had seen from the advertisement that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it was not Danny Brook.
I was really disappointed because he is my favourite actor.
The musical should have started at 19.30, but it started at 20.15.
When I went to ask for the discount on the ticket at the cashier desk they told me no discount was available .
I had seen the advertisement saying that a discount was available.
After the show I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant, but I couldn't because it was closed.
It closed at 10 pm but the show finished at 10.30 pm.
This was not a perfect evening for me, so if you don't give me my money back, I will tell the newspaper about it.
I am looking forward to hearing some good news.
I think in the next 100 years people will wear  with a small engine in the back, because of the atmosphere.
The atmosphere of the earth is now deteriorating badly every year.
The level of carbon dioxide is growing very fast and people cut down more trees, therefore there are not enough trees to absorb the carbon dioxide and produce oxygen.
The designers will have a lot of ideas about how to make very nice and useful clothes.
.
.
I think somebody will a very big area to grow plants so they can sell the oxygen.
This will be a new business.
I think I can win this prize, because these clothes will be produced in soon in the future.
MY NAME is JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT.
THEN I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, "DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE", AND I DIDN'T GET ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM.
I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ALL HUMAN BEINGS.
MODERN TECHNOLOGY HAS AFFECTED ME IN SEVERAL WAYS.
I MEAN THE MORE THE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES; THE MORE WE GET.
NOW WITH MODERN MACHINES I CAN MAKE BETTER USE OF MY TIME.
IF I AM LATE TO GO TO TRAINING AND I HAVEN'T EATEN YET I JUST TAKE MY FOOD AND PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE OVEN.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS COMPUTERS.
I THINK THEY ARE SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED MACHINES IN THE WORLD.
YOU CAN LIVE YOUR ENTIRE LIFE IN A HOUSE WITHOUT GOING OUT, JUST BY USING THE INTERNET.
IT HAS ALSO HELPED ME WITH MY HOMEWORK.
I MEAN IT'S INCREDIBLE THE TIME YOU WASTE BY DOING SOMETHING WITHOUT A COMPUTER.
BUT I THINK ALSO THAT WITH MODERN TECHNOLOGY WE GET MORE COMFORTABLE SO THAT MAKES ME A PASSIVE PERSON AND NOT SO ACTIVE.
THIS CAN BE BAD TOO BECAUSE IF I GET USED TO BEING COMFORTABLE, WHEN I NEED TO DO HARD WORK I WON'T BE ABLE TO .
First, you have changed the actor.
Second, .
Third, .
Last, after the show, I couldn't go to the restaurant, because it was closed.
.
.
Today, technology is a part of life.
.
While we work at the office, there are the computer and equipment to help us to work .
After we have finished work, we come back home, and there is the television .
.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over the rainbow", which was performed in your theatre two weeks ago.
I went to see it on 5th June 2000.
First of all, Danny Brook was not there that evening but an unknown and not very good actor.
Secondly the show started 45 minutes late.
Then at the ticket office I was told that no discounts were available so I had to pay the full price despite the fact that I am a student.
Finally I would have had dinner at the theatre restaurant if it had not already been closed because the show finished, obviously, late.
I am really not satisfied with the organisation of the show particularly because in the advertisement you wrote something false.
For this reason I expect to receive my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets.
Last week we had another demonstration of this.
On Monday we decided to organize a surprise party for Ted's birthday on Tuesday evening.
I am writing with reference to the musical show I saw last week in your theatre.
I hoped that it would be the most exciting evening during my week's holiday in London.
Unfortunately it wasn't.
I wouldn't like to be unkind but I must say that the advertisement for the show included a lot of false information.
First of all, when I bought the tickets it appeared that there was no discount available.
Secondly, I must complain that the musical show started almost an hour late and in addition to this no one apologized.
Moreover, I would like to ask why Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor, didn't perform in the show.
Furthermore, I would like to enquire why the theatre restaurant was closed.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I wish I had known it two days ago...
On 15th June we were at the birthday party.
Dora wanted me to come with Pat because she was in love with him.
I really like Dora and Pat and I just wanted to help them to be together, but it wasn't such a good idea.
I thought that if I said something specific about her he would look at her in a different way.
Well, I forgot that it's just a boy! I shouldn't have told him that she was a virgin.
It was awful when he started to laugh and everybody was staring at us.
Yesterday, I discovered that he told everything to Marl and Tony.
I really regret that I was so foolish.
The most horrible thing is the fact that my friendship with Dora seems to be on the rocks and I don't know what I have to do to overcome the difficulties.
I am writing this letter to you because when I went to your musical show I had a very bad time.
Firstly when I went to the show it was written that the start time was 19.30 but it started at quarter past eight.
I had waited for forty-five minutes.
Secondly the stars were going to be DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE but different people came to the show.
It was the first time I had been to a musical show but I guess it will be the last one too.
Anyway after the show I felt hungry so I went to the restaurant but it was closed because they were having the inside altered.
And lastly that was the worst night I had ever had so I asked for my money back but they wouldn't give me it so I had an argument with the people who worked there but I couldn't get my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Because last year I started smoking and nobody knew that I was smoking but one day as I was smoking at the back of the school someone came up to me and I noticed that it was Pat.
She saw me as I was smoking so that wasn't going to be very good.
She said that she wouldn't tell anyone but I knew she might say it to someone so I was always with her every minute, every second.
But one day as I was walking home like every night I saw Pat in front of our house door talking to my dad.
I just knew I shouldn't have trusted her but as I went in the house my dad asked to stay for a meal.
I was in shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? After a while we sat down for dinner and Pat just told my parents that I was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry.
I couldn't go out of the house for a month so now I know how Pat is and that she can't keep any secrets.
I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show you are putting on at the moment: "Over the Rainbow".
As my husband is a native and we live in Switzerland, we appreciate spending a week in London every year.
We are keen on theatre and musical shows.
Your theatre is known to put on excellent shows.
We were never disappointed before and especially enjoyed "The Drama" you presented last year.
Anyway we had a very disappointing evening.
First, we couldn't get a discount, although you mention it in your advertisement.
And the only tickets left were £20.
Then the show began 45 minutes later than stated.
Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance.
We are used to eating at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good value but also for it's original decor.
Therefore I ask you to give us £20 back, because the two tickets were not worth more.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets.
The following story will prove it.
I left the office at six o'clock.
I was free as the air.
My husband was doing a course all week in Berne.
The kids were with their grandmother, who takes care of them.
I drove to Ouchy where I had a drink.
It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't a swimming costume.
I knew a good place.
I parked the car and waited ten minutes.
As I had planned, the place was deserted.
I took my clothes off and swam for twenty minutes in the lake.
Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing.
I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come across anyone and be able to drive back home.
The car was missing too.
I went to your show called "Over The Rainbow" and I was really disappointed by many things.
Firstly, you spoke about two actors, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but instead of them we had two others and they were really bad.
So I was really surprised.
In addition to this you started the show 45 minutes late.
It was boring for everybody.
How could we appreciate the show properly.
Moreover, in your advert you wrote that there were discounts available but it was not the case.
No discounts were available.
Then you invited people to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because there were no staff to welcome people.
You offered something you could not possibly provide.
I did not have a good time for all of these reasons and I would like you to give me my money back.
I hope you understand my request and you are going to reply as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
The nightmare started .
I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake.
She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with.
She didn't tell me but when I came to the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well.
I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class.
I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground.
I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me.
I couldn't go back to the class so I went home.
My Mum was at home and I told her the whole story.
She said that I had to be strong and not care about them.
So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me.
Then all the girls became jealous and stopped laughing.
I am writing to complain about The Circle Theatre which is very different from .
I will let you know about what I have in mind.
I went to your theatre last Saturday, at about 7.
p.m.
I asked for discounts.
But a clerk said that the time for discounts had ended.
I did not care about the money and I rushed into the theatre and then took a seat with some food.
I was waiting for the show that was supposed to start at 7.30 p.m.
But it started at 8.15.
I felt nervous.
When I saw an actor, he was a different actor.
I was very upset and disappointed.
After the show ended, I was on the way to the theatre restaurant.
, it was closed because of refurbishing.
If you were me, how would you feel? So, I could not help writing to you and would like to receive money back.
I enclose the theatre receipt.
I was born in 1973.
At this time, our nation was a developing country.
Almost all the people had a Television which provided events around our country very quickly.
As I grew up, T.V was one of the most mysterious things like a telephone and a bus.
First thing is the computer.
When I was a university student, I had to find out some information for my homework.
I could not get it.
but a computer allowed me to get it from the Internet.
Third thing is the telephone.
It saves time.
Whenever I do not know about something, I phone someone and ask about it.
All in all, I have been having many benefits from modern technology, which is very useful.
But it might be a problem, making me lazy.
Now, and I have to take advantage of modern technology for my future.
I am writing to you because I have recently been to your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening.
I think that if there had been only one or two problems I wouldn't have written to complain but there were only problems.
I'd like not only to complain but also to have my money back because my evening wasn't "perfect" as you advertised but it was a big disaster.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine.
Then I go to work by motorbike.
The first thing I do when I arrive at my office is to switch on my computer.
 day I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail.
Sometimes I am alone all day but I have contact with many people.
When I have to book a holiday, to buy a book or to check my bank account I use the Internet and I do all these things, and many others, without moving from my office.
When I finish working I come back home.
If I haven't enough time to cook I prepare my meal using my fantastic microwave oven.
If I'm too tired to go out with my friends I finish my day watching a programme on television.
I know that it can appear a sad day but it's what a lot of people do every day in every part of the world.
To conclude, I think that technology has improved many aspects of our daily life.
But it's also true that sometime we aren't able to take a step without it.
First of all, the advertisement I got placed emphasis on Danny Brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and I wonder whether he had real skills .
To make matters worse, not only was the restaurant closed, for no apparent reason, but also the discounts that were said to be available were not.
I find it unbearable to witness such deceitful advertising and to even pay ten pounds to have such a disappointing evening.
Consequently, I ask for my money back, and I will obviously not go back to the Circle Theatre.
I attach my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Over the last five years, she has caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody.
This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her, their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential.
Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested , and decided to lead her own enquiry into this case.
Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story seemed very strange.
Despite Katie's warning, Pat achieved her purpose by carefully questioning her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to steal this camera or else he would be hurt.
Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the the help of adults.
Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway...
She got the two criminals convicted, and recovered the calm within the school.
It was the first time she had saved someone by telling a secret, and she realized she had made a good choice.
I had a very disappointing evening.
First of all: the actors who were mentioned in the advert are not the same as the ones on stage.
I was supposed to see the famous Danny Brook, and what a surprise it was when it was not him.
I was very disappointed.
Secondly the show was meant to start at 19.30 pm.
In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanation.
Thirdly the advert said "discounts available".
This is not the truth.
After that it was suggested we visit your theatre restaurant, but the restaurant was closed! It was a shame.
And you wrote, I quote that it would be "your perfect evening out", excuse me, but I do not agree with you.
It was awful, the worst evening of my life.
So please, it would be fair if you gave me my money back.
I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future.
In my opinion, clothes will not change so much, because fashion is an eternal cycle.
You will always find the same basic clothes, but I think that it will be the materials which will change.
We will find the same kind of clothes with gadgets included.
For example: a short, very classical and inside it could be included a mobile phone, or we could find some buttons too, to provide..
fresh air, why not? Or special flying shoes, and maybe you would have a screen on your watch to watch your favourite soap operas.
Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadget in old clothes, like a dress from the Middle Ages.
I recently was in London, staying in my sister's home, and I went to see "Over the Rainbow".
I had a lot of problems and I would like to tell you about them.
Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, as the said they gave discounts to people who worked at the British Institute.
I mentioned it, but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago.
Why do you put it in the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got to the show late, when I got to my seat, it was taken (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing.
After waiting a while in this uncomfortable seat the show started.
I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I discovered that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor.
And finally when the show ended I decided to go and eat something, but the restaurant was closed because the chef was sick.
Sorry, but none of this is professional, and I am going to , if you don't give me my money back.
Yesterday I decided to go to the "blue disco" because the guy I liked was going to be there.
But there was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so I had to go illegally, and I decided I would do it.
That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I climbed out of my window.
I had told Pat to pick me up.
She was the only one who knew my plan.
I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret.
So when we arrived at the disco there was my guy waiting for me.
To summarise the night, I am going steady with him, and he took me home.
The next morning Pat came to my house.
I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive home last night?...
All the truth was then told, and now I am grounded for life.
She definitely doesn't know how to keep secrets.
There were a couple of things I noted down during the show.
One of the reasons that I chose to see this show was to see Danny Brook live.
But there was a different actor instead of him.
I am very disappointed.
Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start.
Instead of starting at 19:30 pm, it started at 20:15 pm.
I had a meeting straight after the show but I was late and made a fool of myself by arriving late and had to suffer all those people staring at me and whispering.
Then I found out that the discounts were not available but on the notice board it said that they were available.
After the show, I noticed that the theatre restaurant was closed because it was closed that day.
Well, for instance people in Roman times (Roman soldiers) didn't have any sort of transport to move them from one place to another.
The only way they could move was using their feet.
They could walk over 4 km per day without any breaks.
But people nowadays like me can't even walk 1 km.
And also what is the point of walking when you have cars and buses or even bikes.
Phones also affected my daily routine.
If I wanted to find one of my friends, I had to run around our neighbourhood looking for him but now I just have to phone him on his mobile phone and just ask him where he is.
Computers changed my daily routine because, when I was younger, I spent most of my days outside playing basketball but now I just play on the computers all day.
E-mails are also one of my examples.
When e-mails didn't exist, I wrote letters and it took longer to get to the person I was writing to but with e-mails the person could receive my message within a few seconds and you don't have to count how many days it will take before he will receive it.
So in my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily routine quite a lot.
, I would like to inform you that I attended your new musical show, the name of which is "Over the rainbow", last Saturday evening, 10th June.
I'm writing to you to make a complaint about your advertisement, which I consider a lying advertisement.
Let me explain to you why I'm now so disappointed.
I had one week's holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon.
We had prepared this quite a long time ago, this trip to the capital and saved a lot of money as well.
We are both very keen on musicals.
We've already seen "Cats", the "Phantom of the Opera", "les Miserables", "Grease", and so many others.
When we saw your leaflet that mentioned "London's newest and best musical show", we were so enthusiastic and curious that we immediately bought the tickets.
On the evening, people stood at the entrance who were shouting at you because there weren't any discounts available.
One thing that you promised on your leaflet.
We didn't have trouble finding our seats, but we found it very annoying to wait 45 minutes before the show started and more than that your famous actors definitely weren't Mr Brook and Mrs Truelove and we can also add that your restaurant wasn't opened because of hygiene problems.
I can say now that "It wasn't my perfect evening out" and I now request some money back for all these annoyances.
Please find enclosed my thoughts about the fashion of the future.
First of all, I think we should consider the way people are dressing at present to see how it's going to be developed in the future.
Everyone has his own style but it's obvious that many of us are wearing the same clothes as others.
We all follow the new collection on the market.
Today it's wearing short trousers and yesterday it was wearing torn jeans.
What we wear is also influenced by models, the media, or new collections, which come from Paris, London, or New York.
These new clothes are often very expensive, which's maybe why not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market.
In 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create their own clothes.
In my opinion, I think that people will not wear clothes anymore, just be natural, being nude and feeling free, like many many years before.
Because, I think that people need to find their authenticity again.
I hope that my article appears in your magazine.
I am writing to complain because I was really disappointed by your musical show, which is "Over the Rainbow", last week.
I the advertising of the musical and the actual musical show last week.
First of all, the advertising Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
However, when I saw it, the musical starred completely different actors.
I was really disappointed about it.
Secondly, the advertising states the musical starts at 14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started at 20:15.
That's 45 minutes late, and also I asked for a discount ticket at the ticket counter, but no discount tickets were available.
Finally, your theatre restaurant was closed after the show, .
Now then, .
I am really disappointed with your musical.
I am asking you for my money back, because I didn't enjoy your musical.
I am writing a composition about "How modern technology has changed your daily life".
This is our subject.
, not all of it, but still a lot of modern technology has changed our daily life.
First of all, I think more than half the population of Britain has a "mobile phone".
They are small and compact, much lighter than a home telephone, and one of the biggest advantages is you can carry it, so that it is easy to contact your friend or someone they can easily contact you as well, so you can phone anytime you want, whenever you want.
Secondly, .
However, the most important thing is the "Internet".
the "Internet" it is easy to contact people worldwide.
You can send E-mail anytime, anywhere you want.
It is the most popular thing in the whole world.
.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
What is more, every time I trusted her with my secrets, she always let me down.
It was always the same; she would meet with her neighbours afterwards and give my secrets away.
To make matters worse, people gossiped about me and tried to find out more and more about my private affairs, which made me feel embarrassed.
The worst thing was that she started to make up false stories about me, which soon spread all around the neighbourhood.
I am a foreign woman who had a week's holiday in London and decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show.
That show wasn't what it was supposed to be and it is for that reason that I am writing to you.
The second show was supposed to start at 19:30, but to make matters worse, it started at 20.15, so after the show I couldn't go to the cinema.
Also I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed for the holidays.
On top of everything the ticket office didn't offer any discounts, so on the last day I couldn't buy a present for my neighbour.
I am writing to ask for the refund of the £55 which I spent on the ticket for that miserable show.
I am going to write about how modern technology has changed our daily life.
First of all, I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions in human history and that without it we couldn't be where we are right now.
But technology can also help you at home if you use modern machines to clean your house, clothes or dishes.
Apart from that, technology also helps in hospitals.
All the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tasks.
On balance I think that technology evidently has got more advantages than disadvantages.
I am writing to complain about the musical show at the Circle Theatre.
Firstly, the actor who starred was not Dany Brook as advertised but another actor, whose performance was very bad.
That made the show disappointing.
Secondly, the show should have begun at half past seven.
Despite this fact the show began at a quarter to eight.
Also, there were no tickets available and after this bad musical show, the restaurant of the theatre was closed.
My evening was not very pleasant as you advertised.
As a result of this I demand some of my money back.
If I said that technology has not changed my life I would be lying.
If fact technology has changed my life in a major way.
Can you imagine your life without a car or a television? I can't.
Technology is so much a part of my life that I could not live without it.
But technology doesn't only make my life better.
By using a car I not only get an easy way to move around, but I also destroy the environment.
Also, if I use the car for small distances when I could go on foot, I my health.
Can you imagine your life without a television or a computer? I can't.
With the computer I can contact my friends and with the television I relax, I could not find another way to relax and contact others.
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show which took place last 1st of May at "the Circle Theatre" in London.
Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen.
At first sight the theatre was gorgeous.
I was surprised at its facade and also I was anxious to see the beginning of the performance.
My friends and I thought that it would be the perfect night out in London but everything changed when the show was delayed more than forty-five minutes.
Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward to a marvellous night.
The prices that our travel agency confirmed for us were not the same as the ones charged at the theatre.
We asked for our special discount for being students of less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rude answer from the woman who sold the tickets.
On top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat at the theatre.
You can imagine how upset we were and we ask you for some compensation for the night that we spent at your theatre.
Nowadays we think of modern technology as something usual in our lives.
For instance with the arrival of the Internet, the new digital television and the researchers in medicine, we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a button, or look for something new by only thinking about it...
we realize that the new technology has just begun to advance, and it is likely in a few years we will be very advanced in this way.
In my opinion the new technologies have more advantages than disadvantages.
My reasons for saying this are that we can live better, we also have more ways of knowing now to live healthily and how to spend our free time.
Although technology is also used to create new types of weapon and also to kill people, that is only the worst part of it.
But however it is a good idea to spend our money on new enterprises which pay researchers who could investigate how we could improve ourselves.
I'm writing in order to complain about your current musical show, which I saw last week.
It didn't go as I had expected and I was really disappointed when it finished.
Firstly, it was meant to start at 19:30 and I bought my ticket for the evening performance.
However, it began at 20:15.
I would have understood a little bit of waiting time, but everybody agreed that this was too long.
Second, instead of starring Danny Brook, the musical was starring another actor, who I found really disappointing.
Although he sung quite well he danced terribly and that spoiled part of the show.
I asked about the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them.
In addition, we had planned to have dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed as it closes every Thursday.
I think that there's no point in having a restaurant which closes the day the audience is largest.
Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement promised and that we all wanted turned out to be regrettable because of the wasted money.
That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back.
I'm enclosing my ticket and this list of complaints some money.
My daily life has changed quite a lot with modern technology.
I live more comfortably and I am even more carefree than a few years ago.
I've been able to improve some things that would have annoyed me a little while ago, and although they're mainly little changes they make me notice that my life is easier.
At home, for example, my alarm is no longer a deafening sound that breaks the silence and peace of my dreams, it is now the good-morning of my favourite radio programme, set to start at seven o'clock.
Then, when I was younger I would have to put the milk on the hob and wait until it was warm enough to drink.
Nowadays, almost everybody has a microwave oven, where you put your milk for less than two minutes and it is ready to delight your mouth.
Another thing is the fifty-two steps which take me to the street.
They have become as easy as calling a lift, without making me feel tired or breathless when I am in a hurry.
Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want.
Also, with the development of the Internet and its arrival at a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want.
In brief, I am making the most of the discoveries of science and technology and I can't conceal that I'm really glad of that.
I recently had a week's holiday in London.
During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show, which was OVER THE RAINBOW.
However, I had a very disappointing evening.
There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show in the advertisement and .
Firstly the stars in the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors in the musical show.
Secondly at 19:30 on the leaflet but it actually started at 20:15.
Thirdly it said there were discounts available in the advertisement.
However, there were not any at all.
Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because .
It said in the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
I felt very disappointed after seeing the music show in your theatre.
, I want to ask for my money back! I look forwards to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He was so kind that he couldn't resist telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown.
After doing that, Pat left the room.
Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart beating quickly.
She went downstairs quietly and closed the door as soon as she went into her room.
At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind, which seemed like they had just happened yesterday.
"Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?" she said to herself.
"I am just a servant in this castle.
I love him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle." It seemed as if a shadow came in through the window and disappeared quickly.
Everything in the room was quiet except the sound of the clock, as if everything was going to die.
She was so frightened and sad that she had no energy.
She fell onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her.
I am Writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with your show.
Last week I was on holiday and I went to The Circle Theatre to see Over The Rainbow, the musical.
I was really looking forward to seeing it, because I like musicals and also I like Danny Brook.
However, the leading actor was not him! Of course, I was so disappointed.
The actor was not famous for his acting.
Also the musical did not start on time.
It was thirty minutes late.
We just sat on our seats with nothing to do.
I was going to a restaurant with my friends after the musical, but the musical finished at ten thirty.
It was too late and we could not have dinner.
If the musical had started on time, we could have eaten in the restaurant.
Furthermore, no discounts were available, even though we had a student card.
In the advertisement they said that ticket discounts were available.
I think it is a .
Anyway I was so unhappy.
It was not a marvellous evening.
Could you return my money please? You have a responsibility to the audiences.
My life has been changed by technological advances.
Nowadays, we have so many technological things.
For instance, TV, computers, telephones, air conditioners.
These things are very convenient; on the other hand, there are lots of disadvantages.
I have my own TV in my room and I enjoy watching TV every day.
However, I need balance.
If I watch TV too much I might not speak to my family very often.
.
In addition, it is difficult to turn it off.
I think I should cut down on watching TV.
Sometimes it is a waste of time.
What about computers? They are very useful too.
I am living in London, but my father lives in Taiwan and my mother lives in Tokyo.
I sometimes want to hear their voice on the telephone.
Unfortunately it is not so cheap.
If I use e-mail it is much easier and cheaper.
And I can send e-mail anytime.
If I were addicted to the Internet, it would be a problem.
I do not want to spend much time on computers.
In conclusion, people, including me, need balance.
We must be good at using computers.
I am writing to complain about the musical , OVER THE RAINBOW, and also about the service.
When I went to London, during my holiday, I decided to go to the theatre to see a musical , OVER THE RAINBOW.
During and also after the show lots of disappointing things happened.
Thirdly, I also read "Visit our theatre restaurant after the show", but the restaurant was closed because it was being painted.
Last but not least, it also said "discounts available", but there were not any staff there who could provide them.
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me my money back.
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I was reading when I suddenly heard a big bang.
I looked out through the window and saw a big strange "thing".
It looked like a floating potato, a brown potato.
After that a being climbed out of the potato.
It looked at me and said.
I could not believe my ears.
It was the happiest moment of my life.
I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my head teacher walking through the door with the being behind him.
The being moved its hand forward and.....
Recently, I had the opportunity to go to your Circle Theatre event.
Unfortunately I never thought it could be so disappointing.
It started when I received the advertisement on the street.
Because of that, I thought I'd have a wonderful night.
The first problem happened at the box office because there were absolutely no discounts available.
Well, I bought a ticket anyway.
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it actually started forty-five minutes late.
When the show began I had my biggest disappointment, instead of the great Danny Brook, there was another actor, totally unknown.
After the show I was so irritated about the whole thing that I decided to eat at the restaurant and try to relax a little.
To my surprise, it was closed.
Because of all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definitely one of the worst.
So I'd like to have my money back.
Technology is always getting better.
And it is responsible for many changes in my life, and I think I wouldn't be able to live without it anymore.
Nowadays, with the Internet it has become easier to do school work and I also like to chat with other people or maybe read the latest news about my favourite football team.
I also recently got a cellular phone and I don't know how I lived so long without one - because it helps to solve problems so quickly, it's really amazing.
But for me, the best thing is definitely the microwave.
And there is quite a good reason for that.
I live alone, so I have to cook my own food, and I'm the worst cook in the whole world.
There are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
I am writing with regards to the musical show 'Over the Rainbow' and I am going to complain about it.
In addition to this, I could not get a cheaper ticket so I wonder why the advertisement mentioned the discount on tickets.
Moreover, despite there being some restaurants in the theatre, .
I wanted to have a coffee but I could not.
I should not have gone to see the musical.
I do not want to think you told a lie but I felt it was wasting my time and money.
I would like you to refund all the money and I recommend thinking about the advertisement.
I hope you understand me and the show is going to be successful.
She was one of my friends and I couldn't trust her at all because she was a troublemaker.
One year ago, I had a boyfriend and he was the perfect man for me.
I was happy at that time and I met up with him almost every day.
I believed that I would get married to him but my happiness didn't last.
And then I asked him to split up with my best friend but to make matters worse, he chose my best friend! If I hadn't heard anything from Pat, I could have got married to him.
I couldn't do anything and two months later, my boyfriend got married to my best friend.
I felt sad and miserable.
I'M WRITING THIS LETTER BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I WENT TO THE THEATRE TO SEE YOUR MUSICAL SHOW.
AND THROUGH SEEING IT MY FAMILY HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING EVENING AND SO DID I .
YOU CAN READ BELOW MY POINT OF VIEW REGARDING THIS.
FIRST OF ALL, WE COULDN'T SEE THE FAMOUS ACTOR "DANNY BROOK" BECAUSE HE WAS ILL .
I THINK THAT THE MUSICAL SHOW SHOULD HAVE BEEN CANCELLED FOR THIS ALONE.
 WE THOUGHT OF VISITING THE THEATRE RESTAURANT BUT IT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE THE SHOW DIDN'T BEGIN AT 19:30, AS WE HAD READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, IT BEGAN AT 20:15.
IN CONCLUSION, AFTER OF ALL THESE MISTAKES THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR THEATRE I ASK FOR ALL MY MONEY TO BE RETURNED TO ME.
NOWADAYS THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE A COMPUTER IN THEIR HOME AND SOMETIMES WE ASK OURSELVES IF MODERN TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE OUR DAILY LIFE.
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THE ANSWER IS OBVIOUSLY "YES".
FROM OUR HOME WE CAN USE IT FOR DOING A LOT OF THINGS LIKE BUYING FOOD; WORKING, READING NEWSPAPERS AND MANY MORE THINGS.
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE BAD BECAUSE WE NEEDN'T GO OUT TO DO IMPORTANT THINGS AND BECAUSE OF IT WE DON'T MEET NEW PEOPLE AND WE HAVE LESS CONTACT WITH PEOPLE.
IN CONCLUSION I THINK THAT MODERN TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE BETTER IF WE KNEW HOW IT OUGHT TO BE USED.
Last night I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow" and I would like to tell you that it wasn't what I expected to see.
Actually this was because most things I were different from what the advertisement said.
First of all it said that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring, but Danny wasn't there and somebody else took his place.
This was the most disappointing thing I heard.
Also you said that the show was going to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
You ought to know that all the people hated waiting and started to make complaints.
The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open because the owners were on holiday.
Finally you said that it would be our perfect evening out, but like I said before, it wasn't.
Actually it was terrible and I would like to have my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
After we had had an argument she told all the school my secrets.
She really let me down.
I had met her a year before and from the first time we talked to each other we were friends.
It took us a little time to become best friends and after that we were always together.
Every day after school she came to my house or I went to hers.
We were always laughing and having a great time.
I loved her a lot and I thought she felt the same about me, but I was wrong.
Anyway, I always trusted her with my secrets, because I was sure she wouldn't tell them to other people, even if some day we would be apart.
But I was wrong again.
Now the only thing I care about is that she couldn't keep secrets and all the school is looking down on me.
For weeks I'd been planning to go to the theatre with some close relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster for all of us.
What are clothes going to look like a century from now? Are they going to be the same, are they going to be colourful, are men going to wear long skirts and women boxer shorts? This is something that has many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
Fashion has made great progress since the early days.
The variety of new fabrics, their colours and quality, make new fashion statements every day.
And the clothes are getting smaller and smaller.
In the early 90s it was in fashion for women to wear only skirts, long ones actually, and for men to wear trousers.
In the sixties, people wore clothes with flowers, big glasses, and jeans, and men had long hair.
Nowadays women wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men.
Boys pierce their bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
If this continues, and soon men will wear skirts.
Clothes will get smaller (people will be wearing practically no clothes).
People will wear extreme clothes which will be really .
People will wear all those clothes that expensive designers design but no one wears .
I took the decision to write to you because I would like to complain about your theatre.
I am writing to you because last night I expected to have a wonderful evening and unfortunately I was very disappointed.
I and some friends decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show.
We were so excited.
We are on holiday and we decided to go.
We had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
The title of the musical show was OVER THE RAINBOW.
The actors were 2 actors that I know are good.
I believe that some other actors maybe made the whole story more interesting.
You had two times that you could go.
The first was very early, at 2:30, and the other at 7:30.
We went at 7:30.
Finally the musical show started at 8:15.
We waited one hour.
I can say that I wanted to go, but I stayed in the end.
When we went to pay for the tickets there were no discounts and we were 6 people in all.
When the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get their pay first.
We are in the year 2000.
People .
Humans have done many things through the years and made many things possible.
They have invented so many things that have made life more interesting and easier.
I believe modern technology has changed everyone, especially now with computers and all the other machines.
Personally, modern technology has changed me a lot.
First I want to talk about the computer.
Before, I used some other ways to get information or play or communicate with people.
Now I can do all this with the computer.
I can spend so many hours because day by day I discover new things.
Maybe it is not good because you don't have the opportunity to meet people and talk face-to-face.
Apart from computers we have the telephone, TV, and gyms.
All of these are in my life.
About the TV, I spend many hours in front of the TV.
It helps me to relax and spend some hours alone.
.
About the gyms, I like them very much.
Those places have so many machines that you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
In those places you can meet people.
I can say that modern technology has changed my life.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show I saw yesterday, called 'Over The Rainbow'.
Firstly, I was disappointed, because the actor Danny Brook did not appear in the show.
Then, another thing I would like to mention is that the time advertised was wrong, because the show started at 20:15.
Another thing is that there were discounts on the price of the tickets, and I did not get any discount.
also states that there was a restaurant to eat in after the show, but it was closed because it was not completely built.
Finally, I would like to know why would have a perfect evening, because I did not have one, so I would like to have my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
One day, when Peter and Pat were alone in class, he confessed to her that he was gay.
She was very surprised when Pat told her that he was gay.
During the week Pat and Peter talked about the problem he had and the consequences that would follow if he told his parents about it.
On Saturday Peter, Pat and some other friends went to the cinema.
When they were watching the film, Katy and John approached Peter and told him that they would continue being his friends.
Peter got very angry and asked Pat why they had said that to him.
Pat did not answer him.
The next day all the school knew that Peter was gay and even though he didn't mind what had happened he didn't talk to Pat again in his life.
I am writing to complain about what it says in the advertisement .
I was really disappointed.
.
1 The advertisement says the show starts at 19:30.
Unfortunately it started at 20:15.
And I think I could find something more worthwhile to do than just waiting, doing nothing during this spare time.
2 I had expected that there would be discounts available for people who have student cards as it says in the advertisement, but there was not.
3 You recommended the restaurant after the show.
However, all I could see was that the light was off and the door was locked.
This is because they are rebuilding it again.
4 I had also thought in the show there was a different actor.
5 Anyway, I took my headmistress with me and I had stated how wonderful this show was going to be.
It would be great if you considered returning my money as soon as possible.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully.
These 3 Fs can tell you whether you are up-to-date.
.
The 1st "F" is for "fast food", something fast and , which is an ancient .
This is not normally what people wear every day.
The 2nd F is .
For example long baggy trousers, which cover your bright shoes.
Wherever you go everyone would love you because of your trousers, which would clean away all the rubbish that is on the road.
The 3rd "F" could not be anything else apart from something that could make you look "foolish": having holes all over your body (including unsuitable places), or something which could make you look like an animal such as having a big metal ring in your nose etc.
 Firstly, in the advertisement you said that Dany Brook was going to be starring in the play, but you put another actor in his place, which was very disappointing.
Moreover, the play was expected to start at half past seven in the evening, however it started at quarter past eight! We had to wait all that time without anyone explaining to us the reason for this delay.
To make matters worse, your theatre restaurant was closed and one of your assistants said that .
This so-called "Perfect Evening" was very disappointing as well as discouraging us from going to the Circle Theatre again.
Nowadays, technology has extended its reach to almost every area of our interests, jobs and even hobbies.
Therefore, life has changed a lot since a hundred years ago, and my life has changed too.
The biggest achievement of modern technology came into my house as soon as I reached the age of ten.
This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast because of the help it can provide.
My computer helps me with my studies, homework and projects for school.
With the Internet, I became more sociable using the Relay Chat clients, but also developed a kind of boredom, which is known as "Internet Freak Disease"! I use it a lot, so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands.
To sum up, my life is modern gadgets.
Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It just depends on your judgement and the way you plan to use technology.
I'm writing to complain about the theatre show you put on last week because there were too many irregularities during the show.
Firstly, the guest stars who were supposed to perform were different from the ones advertised and very disappointing because they stopped the show twice.
Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late when it was supposed to start at 19:30 and no one explained to us, the audience, what was happening.
To make matters worse when we bought the tickets they were much too expensive and there weren't any discounts for young people or for groups.
But the worst happened when the show finished, because we (my girlfriend and I) were hungry and the theatre restaurant was closed.
Maybe, this was the worst show I have ever seen and for this reason I'll wait for a refund.
Yours Faithfully.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so we couldn't tell her what happened that night.
Jon had crashed Pat's boyfriend's car and he told her that someone had hit the car with a metal stick.
Pat's boyfriend couldn't believe that story but Pat trusted Jon and she thought that he was honest.
However, Jon felt very and he told the truth.
At first they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him.
Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't tell her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend.
It could have been worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything from her.
Last Sunday my friends and I saw that advertisement about the play you were supposed to put on.
We thought that it was a good chance for us to watch it.
"Over the Rainbow" was supposed to start at seven thirty.
We went there on time.
We waited there for forty-five minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it.
We really got bored, like all the other people there.
We were very disappointed because before this happened we the tickets but there were no discounts available.
And then .
Then we expected to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
We did see Tina Truelove but we did not see Danny Brook.
That was very disappointing.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I made a big mistake by trusting him.
What a fool I was.
Last Wednesday my sister told me that our grandmother had a serious illness and she was going to die.
She told me to tell no one.
We didn't want our grandmother to find out at that moment so we were trying to keep it secret.
I knew Pat, my cousin, loved our grandmother very much.
She and Pat had a special relationship.
Despite the fact that I had to say nothing, I thought it was right to tell Pat the truth.
After a lot of thought I told  him.
Pat started screaming and shouting.
I knew he couldn't stand it.
But I was sure he would say nothing.
I was wrong.
He told me that he had to tell  my grandmother.
I couldn't do anything.
When Pat left my house he went right away to the hospital.
He found her there.
And the worst happened.
My grandmother was very sensitive and bored with life and when she heard it, her condition became more serious.
After two days she died.
Pat, my sister and I felt very responsible.
But there was nothing we could do.
We knew we had lost her for ever.
How are you? I'm not so well, and that's the reason why I'm writing this letter to you.
Because you are the manager of the theatre, you have to know about the problems which it has.
First of all, and the most important for me, is that you lie to your audience.
I didn't see Danny Brook anywhere, but another actor.
That was a big mistake.
Unfortunately your advertisement said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later.
Also there weren't any discounts.
So, that's why I'm asking you to give me some of my money back.
I was expecting the perfect evening out, it was in the end one of the most disappointing of my life.
That's a good question! I know that each student will give a different answer, but some of us will have some .
I think that the development of technology in the last 30 years has helped and is still helping us a lot in our daily life.
With TV we can learn what is going on all over the world.
With telephones, aeroplanes, and even fast ships, there are no big distances any more.
Every summer I go abroad with my family.
We can see new countries, learn about their history etc.
With my computer (and the Internet) I can speak to my friends wherever they are.
All this may sound great, but it isn't all .
Using the TV and computer makes people more closed.
You might not know your neighbour because you are in the house all the time.
Children are not studying as much as they ought to, because they are watching TV, talking on the phone or even playing computer games.
That's why my marks this year were a bit low.
And of course my parents were very angry with me.
This is also another cause of heart attacks.
Your advertisement for the musical Over the rainbow said it was London's newest and best musical show.
I agree with that because it is a wonderful show but it said that Danny Brook would be starring in it.
I was really excited, but it turned out to be a different actor and I thought that was quite disappointing.
In the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.
Pat couldn't resist and told her brother Jacob.
He was quite shocked about the news because he misunderstood.
He understood that 'Carlotta wants to kill Charles but she is still thinking about it.' Jacob runs as fast as sound to get to Charles's house.
There, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
"What, you're crazy!" Charles responds.
"I'll talk to her," Charles exclaims.
It was all a misunderstanding.
They managed to sort everything out and Carlotta never had anymore secrets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I'm telling you this because I had a big problem a few days ago because of her.
Pat used to be my best friend but a few days ago I found out the truth.
 I got very angry and immediately I went to talk to Pat.
At first, Pat denied all the things my friends told me about her but she finally agreed with that.
I asked her why she couldn't keep my secrets and she told me that it was impossible for her to keep secrets.
She was very sorry about that and a few days after she moved to another city and now I don't know anything about her.
I thanked my new friends for not telling anybody my secrets even though before the trouble we weren't very close friends.
Now I'm very happy with my new friends and I have learnt that I can't trust anybody too much because you don't really know what the person is like.
I am writing to you to complain about the Play you are advertising as the "London's Newest and Best Musical Show" in newspapers and leaflets.
To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience of my whole life.
I cannot bear it when somebody says something and then does just the opposite .
To begin with, I would like to inform you, in case you do not know, that the play does not start at 19.30 as it says in the advertisements.
What is more there were 45 minutes of waiting before it started and it did not satisfy all the expectations people had.
On the other hand, despite the fact that you said that it was starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, I must tell you that Danny Brook did not appear at all.
Instead of him there was another actor who could neither act nor sing, even though it was a Musical .
The last thing I would like to complain about is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed, because, as we were told, of "VACATIONS".
If the advertisements and leaflets say "VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW" there is no reason for it being closed.
It should be open at least until everyone gets out of the place.
It must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
To cut a long story short, because of everything I have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
In our grandparents' time life was so different that we cannot believe that this huge change to our daily life happened in only one hundred years or less.
First, we have to admit that technology has really increased our ability to communicate, to travel and to get information.
You can now know what is happening on the other side of the world at the same time as it is happening.
What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the "enter" key on a computer.
Furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
Strange as it seems, we now have all types of machine or specialised technology to make our daily life more comfortable and less stressful.
Things that human beings used to do are now being done by computers and machines more efficiently and rapidly.
On the other hand, despite the fact that technology makes things easier in our daily life, the same happens in industries and companies where they use computers and machines instead of people.
As people do not get jobs because they are not needed they fall into poverty, criminal activities, become isolated and have no chance of getting a good education.
This is the most terrible disadvantage technology has.
With advantages and disadvantages, technology is a fact of life and may represent an advance for some and a bad thing for others.
Every day things and technology change our life, our jobs, our way of facing the world, this is .
Dear Sir, I would like to tell you how disappointed I am about the musical show you manage.
As I had a whole week's holiday I decided to spend it in London.
At first I thought I would just do a bit of sightseeing all around the city.
But when one night I saw your advertisement I decided to spend my last night in the city watching a musical .
No sooner had I seen who the starring actor was than I couldn't believe it.
Danny Brook was one of my best friends while I was at University.
But as the show began, I realised that the actor was someone different, his name was Tim Paradise.
If this had been my only disappointment nothing would have happened, but I had to wait till quarter past eight to watch the show, instead of it beginning at half past seven as you had written in your advertisement.
Although I found the ticket's price much too expensive I thought that there would be some discounts available, but there were not.
As a conclusion to that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed.
For all of these reasons I have to ask you to give me my money back.
It all began when I decided to take part in that school project.
It consisted in having to memorise a whole book of 250 pages in order to pass a final exam.
Although this project could seem like very tough work, I had to try it in order to raise my low overall mark.
One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk.
, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers into my notebook.
I couldn't believe it.
This would be the easiest exam I would do.
As I went out of the office I found Pat, my best friend, walking down the corridor.
As she was also doing the project I decided to let her copy the answers.
I told her she mustn't talk about it to anybody.
She agreed and went home very happy.
When night came I couldn't believe what was happening.
Almost all my classmates were at the front door of my house asking me if I had the answers to the exam.
I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret.
On the exam day everybody answered every question correctly.
And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were.
It was the last time I trusted Pat.
I am writing to complain about the musical show I saw last Friday in your theatre.
Firstly, it was written that Danny Brook would be performing in it, but in fact he wasn't.
I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard of .
In addition to this, the time, 19.30, wasn't correct.
We wasted our time waiting outside in the cold until the doors opened 45 minutes late.
Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a discount.
Again, it wasn't true.
When I enquired about the discounts, with the cashier, they told me that they didn't have any information about them.
Lastly, after all my disappointments when I wanted to visit your restaurant, it was closed because it was too late.
I think that you are not a good manager.
Therefore, I should be grateful if you would send me back some money for all the I've had in your theatre.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat is my best friend.
We spent all our childhood together, usually driving our parents mad.
As we grew up, we were getting closer and closer, sharing all our love stories and even more.
I'm certain that our friendship is stronger than other people's.
But I do have a problem with her.
Pat isn't good at keeping secrets.
Even worse, she is not able to keep anything to herself.
For instance, I was organizing a party for my sister's birthday, asking all her.
friends to keep their mouths closed.
They all did except one: Pat.
Last year, Pat and I were driving back home and unfortunately, driving too fast, I drove through the front gate.
I was wondering how to tell my parents and I asked Pat if she could keep it secret till I found the way to tell them.
Of course, the following day all my family had heard my odd story.
In conclusion to this, why do I still get on with her.
It's the fact I love her as much as my sister and I know that she can change if she must because, last week, she organized a huge party for me, without telling me.
I am writing to complain about your musical show which was performed last Friday.
I was interested in your advertisement and I booked the Friday show while I was on holiday.
However, this theatre made me disappointed from the start of the show until its finishing.
First of all, I saw that the discounts were available, but there were not any discounts and for the audience.
Also the show started at 20:15 .
.
Moreover, the show was awful.
I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but the actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed with the excuse that it was being repaired.
In fact, the notice had been displayed since last winter.
It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people.
In conclusion, I was very disappointed in the whole of the show.
Furthermore,, I could not enjoy my holiday after the show.
Therefore, I would like you to refund some money.
I look forward to recieving your prompt reply.
Fashion of the Future.
Return to Nature.
The World is being Changed rapidly by developing technology and industry.
It affects us in lots of ways.
One of them is in the area of fashion.
People think that we will wear simple, practical, light clothes.
For instance, we can see that kind of clothes in sci-fi films like Starwars.
However, on the other hand, there is a different idea.
People like designer's clothes like Armani, Chanel..
and so on.
They prefer new original style in order to make them look more attractive.
Moreover, most designers prefer to use natural material.
They have used animal and fish skins, some plants and herbal things rather than chemical .
In my opinion, people want to wear special and original clothes to show their own characters.
Also countless fashions will be seen.
People will prefer to use more natural than chemical things and wear more beautiful and attractive clothes.
I am writing to complain about a number of things.
I went to London on holiday and to The Circle Theatre to see Over The Rainbow.
However, this musical was not as good as I expected.
First of all, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it started at 20.15.
To make matters worse, instead of Danny Brook performing you had another actor, which was very disappointing.
Secondly, it says in your advertisement that discounts would be available, despite the fact they were not.
On top of everything, you recommended visiting the theatre restaurant after the show.
However, this was closed due to lack of staff.
According to your brochure this would be the perfect evening out.
Considering my experience, it was not.
I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Nowadays, there are more and more people who want to become designers and the competition is increasing.
Everybody wants to be the best.
Due to this the quality of clothes is getting better and in 100 years we will be asking for a greater variety of clothes.
Although, the price of clothes is increasing, people still buy them.
We give other things priority so we are able to afford our clothes.
On the whole, people nowadays do care more about their appearance and will continue to do so.
I think people in the future will begin to wear only fashionable clothes.
If you feel nice in an outfit your confidence will be likely to increase and this might also help you to advance your career, something which is very important today.
I am writing to let you know about the disappointing evening I had seeing your show with the worst services I have ever experienced.
First of all, on the ticket it says that the actor was Danny Brook and really he was not.
A different actor appears in the show, so I was very disappointed.
Then, on the ticket it says that the show starts at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very impolite on your part, and, also, you wasted my time.
The other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when I asked about it, there were none.
The last thing is that you invited us to visit your restaurant after the show, but it was closed because the food was not yet done.
I thought you were a good theatre, where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but really I am very disappointed and I want to ask for my money back.
I'll never return because of the bad service you offer.
Truly.
All of us know that technology and science have affected our lives.
Considering my whole life I can say that modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways.
The first thing is that it has changed my family relationship.
It has, in some way, separated the family, making all of us worried about our own things.
We all work separately, developing individually and forgetting we have to all talk together to know about each other's life.
The second thing is that it has made my life easier.
communication over the world is faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute.
It has allowed me to worry about other things in my life.
The last thing is that technology has allowed me to have better health.
It has invented many instruments that help me to maintain my health.
To finish, I can say technology has changed my life in good and bad ways, helping things to be easier but making me dependent.
I am writing to complain about your show.
We had a very disappointing evening yesterday.
We thought that we would like to let you know all the details of what went wrong.
First of all, we went to the theatre to pick up our tickets.
We were thinking we would get a discount on our tickets, because we had read this in the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay the full price for the show.
We were ready for the show at 19.30.
We sat in our seats and waited for the show but it didn't start on time, it started at 20.15 which was a ridiculous time.
We waited for 45 minutes.
Next we wanted to eat something at the Theatre Restaurant, but it was again a disappointment, because the restaurant was closed.
Finally, we had a totally miserable night at your show.
You can't take this bad feeling away but you might give us our money back.
This would be the first good thing for us to come from your show.
People who live in the city use lots of technological stuff.
They make their lifestyle much easier and faster .
In the twenty-first century, things are changing very fast.
If we look at family life, they have .
Children have their own televisions, computers and telephones in their room.
Mother and Father have their own cars and mobile phones.
Sometimes even the children have their own mobile phone as well.
The house : fire alarm, burglar alarm, house temperature gauge, automatic garage door, etc.
They use all of this because they want to do their work and leisure activities with the help of these devices.
I am writing this letter to inform you that the advertisement for the musical show appeared with wrong information.
Firstly, the actors were different from the ones in the advertisement, which was very disappointing for me.
Furthermore, according to the advertisement it was supposed to begin at 14.30 and 19.30 but it started at 20.15.
Moreover, when I bought the tickets I was expecting discounts to be available, however, there were no discounts available and the tickets were more expensive than the price published in the advertisement.
When the show ended I went to visit the theatre restaurant.
I could not get in because it was closed as the restaurant's chef was not there.
Firstly, we can cook our meals on an electrical stove or in a microwave and it takes just a few minutes to get ready.
We do not need to light a fire in order to cook as in the old days.
Secondly, doctors have found the cure for many diseases and many operations have been done in less time and in a painless way.
By using special machines doctors have been able to save more lives than in the past.
 who need to travel in order to do business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive at their destination safely or have their problems solved via telephone.
To sum up, technology has been a great help to all of us.
In the future, it will be able to help people even more since it has been advancing day by day.
I am writing to make a complaint about the Circle Theatre.
I recently went there to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I was very disappointed to find out that most of the things said in the advertisement for the show were not true.
For example, the advertisement said that Danny Brook would be the lead actor, but he was not.
Instead, there was this unknown actor who gave a very bad performance and had a terribly annoying voice.
Moreover, the play did not start at the time it was supposed to.
I had to wait for forty-five minutes.
All the waiting made me quite hungry, so I was expecting to have good meal at the theatre restaurant after the show.
However, it was closed for cleaning.
Modern technology and science have changed my life in many ways.
Easy access to information and the new ways of communicating with other people help me save time that I can spend doing whatever I want to.
Of all the recent technological advances, the one that has had the greatest impact on my life is the Internet.
It provides you with all the information you want.
I don't watch the news on television anymore, because I can use my computer to read only the things that interest me.
Mobile phones are another thing that are making my life much easier.
They allow you to talk to other people no matter where you are.
This can be very useful when you have a problem that needs an immediate solution.
All these things save me lots of time.
I get to rest more and spend more time at home, and so they make me a happier person.
For the next few years, we can expect many more technological advances that will continue making our lives easier.
My name is Paula and I'm one of your most recent visitors to your show "Over the Rainbow'', this is also the reason for my letter.
Last week during my holiday in London, I found your advertisement in my newspaper.
This looked very good to me - one of my favourite actors, the time suited me and there was a discount available for the tickets.
Everything was just perfect.
But, suddenly the whole evening changed into something we didn't expect at all.
The first disappointment confronted us at the main entrance; there was no discount for our tickets available.
Despite this we were still looking forward to the show and Danny Brook.
You stated in your advertisement that he would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up.
Actually, this guy was not half as good as Danny Brook.
The other thing was the time.
The show was supposed to start at half past seven, but we had waited for 45 minutes, before the light turned off.
Till then we had been very upset about the evening and decided to go for dinner.
Finally, the restaurant which belongs to the theatre was closed.
I really do regret that I told Pat about my feelings for the new girl in class, but who else can you talk to if it is not your best friend?.
Her name is Carla and she just changed school.
She is so beautiful, with long legs, blond hair and a voice which makes me melt.
I'd never been so fascinated by a girl and so I knew it must have been real love.
Luckily I could keep my secret for a couple of days but then it became urgent and I needed someone to talk to.
Pat, he was my friend, and he knew girls.
I thought he would keep everything between him and me, but he disappointed me.
I am writing to share with you some feelings I have after watching a musical show which was put on at The Circle Theatre last week.
Unfortunately my feelings are rather bad.
I had a week's holiday in London last week, when I saw your advertisement concerning the 'Over the Rainbow' musical show.
The advertisement looked pretty interesting and I decided to go to the theatre to watch this musical show.
This was especially due to the fact that I wanted to see Danny Brook - my favourite actor.
I was really disappointed when I saw a different actor.
The 'theatre' did not even apologize for this change.
To make things worse the show started 45 minutes later than it should have (it started at 20:15 instead of 19:30).
Despite my being a student and the advertisement saying that discounts were available, I was refused a half-price ticket, and the explanation 'why' wasn't sufficient.
I tried to relax after the show, so I made my way to the theatre restaurant, which, according to the advertisement, ought to have been open at that time.
Unfortunately it was not, which made me even angrier.
There was no information about why it was closed and if it would be open at all.
The advertisement says 'your perfect evening out'.
However, it was the worst evening I have had in London.
I would like you to give me my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I told her about my plans on Monday.
However, on Friday almost half of my class knew what was going on.
I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence.
I wanted to tell them about this after I passed the exam.
Saturday morning I went to the driving centre for my first lesson.
I had never driven a car before.
I hoped that nobody was watching me.
Unfortunately, Pat was there and half of my class.
I felt terrible.
The instructor opened the car door and asked me to sit in the driver's seat.
It was the worst time I ever had.
At the beginning I couldn't start the engine.
Then I drove very slowly very often crossing the white line on the road.
I looked in the mirror and I saw how my friends were laughing.
It made me crazy.
I started doing stupid things: turning right instead of left and so on.
The next day, I decided that I didn't want to go to school any more.
I was afraid that everybody would comment on my first lesson.
I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans.
, things weren't so bad.
I went to school and everyone was very friendly.
Pat apologized to me for not keeping my secrets.
At the beginning I was very angry but in the end I said that everything was O.K.
We are good friends nowadays.
However, I will never tell her my secrets.
I am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisement and the real show.
I am also expecting to get some money back.
First of all, the show started 45 minutes late.
We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason for the delay and apologise about it.
If there had been someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something.
Then, as we were told that the show was beginning, the second shock of the evening faced us.
Instead of the famous actor Danny Brook, a very bad and disappointing actor showed up.
....
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Knowing that, he decided not to see Alison until the birthday party.
Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles.
The best bakery was on the other side of the town so there was no danger of him seeing Alison and revealing the party.
He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery.
On his way he saw lots of places he could have bought the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which was the handiest for Alison's house, he kept on riding.
When he reached the bakery, he was quite relieved and he almost forgot that he had a secret to keep.
After picking the best cake he was preparing to go back.
He suddenly saw Alison and said "Do you like the cake? It's for your birthday party".
I am writing in order to tell you about something that happened to me at the theatre.
At the time I felt astonished, thinking : "How can an important theatre have problems like this?" But, Yes.
First the star was going to be Danny Brook, but then another man took his place.
I couldn't believe it.
You can't replace Danny Brook, a very important artist, and put a novice in his place.
It was very disappointing.
Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15.
Yes, 45 minutes! I want to see you in that position.
What would you do? I felt like a fool, and all the audience felt as I did.
And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist.
More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was under repair.
, I could see that the advertisement said, "Your perfect evening out".
It wasn't the perfect evening.
Now I'm looking for a lawyer, because I want my money back, .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to school, a car stopped beside her and a man said, "I know who is your lover, it's Peter".
Maria spent all day thinking about who told them that.
There were two possibilities: one, her best friend Becca, or her sister Pat.
But the problem began to get worse because all her friends knew her secret.
It was like a "chain reaction", until Maria didn't want to go to school anymore.
Her mother talked to her, but there was no .
She was very angry and hurt.
One day, at her house, she listened to Pat talking with a friend and Maria realised that Pat had told everything, because they were talking about a secret of another friend.
But there was a problem - how to say it to Pat, in a good or in a bad way.
She decided for the good one.
Obviously, Pat first denied it, but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologised to Maria.
After that Pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission.
I am writing this letter because I am very disappointed with your musical show.
I recently went to London on vacation, with some friends.
We were told that this was a great show, and we decided to see how it was.
If the show was as good as we were told we should save our final night for it, this was going to be the end of our vacation, a great one, by the way.
When our final day arrived, we went shopping in the morning and then we went to the hotel to change our clothes and get ready for the show.
When we arrived, there were a lot of people, the place was beautiful, all seemed perfect.
When we entered the place our problems began.
First, there were no discounts on the tickets but that was fine.
Then, the show had a great delay, almost an hour; we dealt with that too.
After that they changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us really angry.
But that isn't all, to complete this tragedy the restaurant was closed.
How has modern technology changed my daily life? I think that technology has changed my life and everybody's life in many ways.
Nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your house, your school, office or any place you can be in a city.
This technology has helped to make my life easier and more exciting, but like everything it has had some negative aspects.
This technology has helped in many fields, like medicine, entertainment, work and other things, so it has obviously changed the lives of many people.
The bad consequences that this could have are unimportant, in comparison with all the good things it has done, so let's not focus on the negative aspects of it.
I'm writing to complain about the poor administration of your theatre, because the advertisement for the show and the actual show were completely different.
First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in your advertisement but when I sat in my seat, a different actor and actress appeared.
I was very disappointed because I was longing to see them, as a fan.
Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages.
How has modern technology changed our daily life? Of course, our life will be completely changed.
However, we have to consider .
First of all, the developed technology and science will make our life more convenient than now.
All your tasks will be performed by computers.
For example, if you watch "The Star Trek" - science fiction programme on TV, you will realise that you can just say "Do it" and then the computers will do it.
However, there are some problems.
If all your are fulfilled by computers, we might be idler than now.
Moreover, we have to consider our environment.
As you know, even now, science and technology are destroying our environment, for example weird temperature etc.
If we don't protect our environment, our daily life will not be convenient.
Rather, our daily life will be deteriorated.
To sum up, future civilization is important for us.
If there is our daily life will be unhappy.
I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', produced by the Circle Theatre.
I was really disappointed therefore I am writing a letter of complaint.
Firstly I bought the ticket because I like Danny Brook's acting but in the show someone was playing his part.
Also this person was not really good at acting.
Secondly the time on the leaflet is totally wrong.
It said it would start at 19:30.
In fact it started at 20:15.
I was waiting for 45 minutes.
Thirdly the ticket was not and after the show I visited the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the show started late.
Finally last night was not a perfect evening.
Therefore I want to have my money back and I hope you will think about these problems.
I am writing an article about the fashion of the future for the international student magazine.
Fashions are always changing therefore it is really difficult to say what sort of clothes people will wear in the future.
But when I hear the word future, I have an image of metallic colours so that in my imagination they are wearing metallic or brightly coloured clothes.
Maybe they will have more colours than now.
However, I don't think the fashion will have because I believe that fashion is in a .
is all our fashions come from history.
For example our style at the moment comes from 70's fashion.
We always .
 I think people will wear clothes which are metallic or in the future.
On the evening I spent in your theatre, I was supposed to see "Over the rainbow" (as you wrote on the flyer).
You wrote so persuasively that it would be our "Perfect Evening Out"...
I am really disappointed about this experience.
I spent £20 - and there was not as you wrote any "discount available".
I will not make trouble but I ask you politely for my money back.
I hope you will agree and share my disappointment.
I think we have to take our environment into consideration: pollution makes the atmosphere warmer and warmer.
In fact, winters will be rare or will maybe even disappear.
The ice will melt, the weather will be warmer.
People won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
Community: another very important point! The electronic community in our lifestyle.
We will see objects become smaller.
So small that I can not imagine, they will be introduced (maybe like chips) into our clothes.
I am writing to complain about your musical show, which I saw last Saturday.
According to your advertisement, one of the stars was supposed to be Danny Brook.
However, a different actor played the role instead of him.
You can imagine how upset I felt, as I really wanted to see his performance.
To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m., it started at 8:15 p.m.
What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off.
On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available.
I was really disappointed with your show.
I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and the discomfort which I suffered.
I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days.
 days, young people prefer wearing shabby and scruffy clothes to wearing neat and tidy clothes.
In other words, their fashion has become more casual.
I think this tendency will become more common in the future.
In general, their parents don't like their fashion.
They want their children to wear smart clothes.
When they were young, they judged another person by his appearance.
They were also asked to wear clothes which were in accordance with the occasion.
In my opinion, this is still correct.
However, people have noticed that what is important is not their clothes but their mind.
If someone doesn't know much about the event which he is attending, even if he wears smart clothes, he doesn't look like a gentleman.
What I want to say is that people don't mind his clothes if he .
To sum up, people will wear clothes more , in the future.
What is important is not their fashion but .
Firstly, Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were supposed to perform in the show but instead of them different actors performed - badly.
Secondly, the show should have started at 19:30 but it started late, at 20:15.
The Theatre also promised discounts, which were not available, so I had to pay the full amount.
Finally, I would like to ask you for £20 back as I was not satisfied with your services.
I hope you pay attention to my complaints.
I would not like to take legal action, as it would not be convenient for either of us, but I will if I consider it necessary.
But Pat could not resist the temptation to call the police.
We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me, "May I talk to you?".
At that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I fainted.
When I came to Mr Smythe was under arrest and, fortunately, this thing finished well for me.
Last week I had the chance to spend time in London and this is why I decided to go to the Circle Theatre to see the show.
Firstly, I would like to tell you I unfortunately had a very bad evening.
Indeed, I was very surprised to hear when I asked for a discount that it was not possible to get one.
In spite of that, I finally decided to get one ticket.
The worst was when the actors and the starring names were completely different to what I expected.
This is why, for all of these good reasons, I am asking for some money back.
I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending on it.
I look forward to hearing from you .
Yours faithfully.
Our century is a century of changes, of evolution.
Since the end of the 40's, which is the period when technology started to advance, nobody can say that nothing has changed.
Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent on technology.
In fact our lifestyle is based on technology, now, if we want to stay at home without having contact with other people, we can do it, we just need a computer and a modem and that's it.
If I want to discuss something with friends or order a Pizza, I can do it as easily as I want, when I want.
Because of that, I think technology is improving my quality of life.
A good example is the cellular phone.
I can contact my family without any problem, I can inform my company if I have an accident in my car.
If I compare my life now with the life of my grandparents, I think both are comparable.
I say that because without knowing about the technology, it's difficult to imagine a better life, in fact, you .
Even if technology is important for my quality of life, I am not able to say if that will continue to be the case in 10 years.
I am Carlos Gregore and during my last holiday I stayed in London for a week.
It was then I read the advertisement for the show at your theatre and I decided to see it.
An actor was changed and the public were not informed.
There were no discounts available like the ones in the advertisement .
I think modern technology is very important in my life.
I also think I am lucky, because I live in a period of technological boom.
In the last fifty years human technologies have grown exponentially.
First the conquest of space, then computers, and now the new biotechnologies have changed, and are changing, the face of the world.
My daily life should be changed by these innovations! In the present day, for example, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very large proportion of those also have the Internet, the new frontier of computer evolution.
If I look back to the past I find that the computer is following the same route as television, the telephone and a lot of other things that now the largest part of the population have at home.
So, in my opinion, new technology has changed, is changing and will change my daily life; I hope that afterwards my life will be better.
First of all, it was written in the advertisement for the show that the main actor would be Danny Brook, but a different actor played in the show.
The show started forty-five minutes late and this really disappointed me.
Besides, when I bought the ticket, I found out there were not any discounts for tickets, while you wrote the contrary.
Moreover, I could not go to the theatre restaurant because, by the time the show had finished, it had already closed.
Definitely, it was a very disappointing evening and I would appreciate it if it is possible to have my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She was a very pretty and kind girl, but she had this bad habit.
This was her only fault.
She had a lot of friends but nobody trusted her.
That was why she decided to change her behaviour.
She was given a chance: if she was able not to tell everybody a secret for a short time, her friends would start trusting her.
The secret was about a surprise party for her best friend's birthday.
As soon as the arrangements for the party started, she began to feel nervous and anxious because she wanted to tell everything to her best friend.
But, as the days went by, she was surprised because she realized she was getting used to not telling secrets anymore.
The day of the party arrived and Pat succeeded in keeping the secret.
All her friends were amazed at how she had changed and started trusting her at once.
I am PINAR xxx.
One week ago I watched your show.
I was very disappointed because I didn't find what I was expecting at your show.
After all these problems I became disappointed because it was only a week's holiday in London.
If you could give me some of my money back that would be a great apology for the waste of time and my disappointment.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets.
I had known that before but I thought that he might have changed.
I trusted him and told him the truth.
It was about Marine, who was our close friend.
The reality was that Marine's parents were not her real parents, they found her in their house's garden.
They tried so many things to find her family.
For a year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find them.
In this one year they spent most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they wanted to be her parents.
When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and said that he was Marine's father and he wanted to take her, and he added that he left Marine because her mother died two days after Marine's birth and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him in prison.
He had nobody that he could give Marine to so he left her in their garden.
Marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved Marine so much.
They gave a lot of money to Marine's real father to keep her.
After that Marine's father took the money & left her.
The couple couldn't tell the truth to Marine because they were afraid of losing her.
After I told Pat the truth Pat said this to Marine.
Marine said to Pat "I knew that because I talk to my real father every month but my parents don't know that because I am waiting for them to tell me the truth".
I went to the theatre to see a musical show, "Over the rainbow", and had a very disappointing evening.
According to your advertisement, the actor should have been Danny Brook, but in fact it was a different person.
My ticket was for 19.30, but it started very late.
It started at 20:15.
When the show finished, it was too late to catch the train home.
I had to take a taxi.
It cost me £30.
"What a waste!,, By the way, I didn't see any discounts on tickets.
One more thing, the theatre restaurant was closed when I went there for a drink.
I don't know why.
There was no note or information about that.
I am not sure that I did have a perfect evening out.
Would you consider giving me my money back? If a refund is available, that would be great.
I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat is one of my colleagues from the office.
She works with me.
We get on very well.
She is a single mum.
She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understanding.
Last week, I missed work on Tuesday, so Pat had to work harder because she was all alone.
I appreciated her and she didn't mind.
I told her the reason why I had to miss work.
My son was in prison.
I had to go and see him.
I still don't know how it really happened to him.
All I know is it is about drug smuggling, and that he is involved.
I asked her not to tell anyone, because I didn't want others to know about this.
I am a very private person.
Yesterday morning, I went to the toilet.
I overheard two people talking about my son.
I felt sorry for myself and I burst into tears.
I quickly got out of the toilet.
I don't remember how I finished work that day.
Nowadays, it is hard to trust people.
No one is perfect.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I decided to forgive my friend Pat.
I went to London for a week of "pure holiday", thinking I would have some fun going to see your musical show.
When I arrived I didn't get a discount (which had been advertised!!) The show was meant to start at 19:30 and I arrived early, frightened of not finding a good place to see "my hero".
I was getting angry, but, finally, the show started and I became quieter.
I hope, that in the future, you will understand that it isn't right to write false things in an advertisement.
Science and technology characterize our modern society.
They have made big progress in our everyday life and they are always becoming more important for us.
If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comforts (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by hand or by animal labour: I think at that time life was really much harder than now! We have to say that technological advances have given our society "their good fruits" but, at the same time, they have negative aspects too.
Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or "green" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noise are the main problems of our society.
I know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily I think I couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV...
But, sometimes I ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
I'm a student from St.
Petersburg, and I'm studying in a drama academy.
My friend & came to London for an excursion.
We were lucky to get tickets to the ,,Over the rainbow" show in your theatre.
Danny Brook is my favourite actor & to see him was my dream since my childhood! It was a surprise when we were told there would be another actor.
Also, we expected to get a discount as students, but international students cards are not valid in your theatre (that is very strange - even your advertisement has information about discounts).
Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was delayed for 45 minutes! So we were late for our supper in the hotel and the theatre restaurant was also closed without any reasons given.
In the advertisement it said ,,your perfect evening out!" , but it wasn't.
And I think, I proved this to you.
I'm dealing with mobile communication - mobile phones and .
I can see how different firms produce more & more new mobile phones.
They have more different functions and forms.
It is very interesting for me , their possibilities.
I'm writing to you to explain the problem that I have had in your theatre.
I recently had a week's holiday in London, and, during my stay, I went to your theatre to see "Over the Rainbow" because I had seen an advertisement for this show and I was really interested in seeing it for many reasons, one of the reasons is that I love the star, Danny Brook.
And I would like you to know that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw.
Secondly, in your advertisement the time of the show was 19:30 and in reality the show started at 20:15 and the discount was not available.
Finally, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was already closed.
So, I had a very disappointing evening and it would be very kind of you if you gave me back the money I spent.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
I think it is very good to have science and technology because they can really affect our lives.
For example, 20 years ago, people who were affected by the AIDS Virus couldn't live more than two or three years, but now with the new science, there are several therapies and now people affected by this virus can live many years.
I think you can do a lot more things now than before with technology.
best regards.
With reference to the show last week, I am writing to complain about the show, which was very disappointing.
In the advertisement, it states that the actor in this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE.
As a result I asked my acquaintance to come with me to the show.
As soon as the show started, I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY.
I was very disappointed.
In addition the concert didn't start on time.
It was a quarter of an hour late.
If I had known that the show was going to be late, I would have asked my mom to come with me, because her working day ended at eight o'clock.
The restaurant was closed after the show ended.
Also there were no discounts available.
As a result I had to pay extra for the tickets.
In conclusion, it wasn't a perfect evening.
I didn't enjoy it at all due to the inaccurate advertisement.
I would like to ask for my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
As a result Mallory had been arrested by the police two years ago.
In addition he had to serve a life sentence.
The story began in 1989 in New York.
Mallory and his partner, Pat, had thought up the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank.
However, the only way to get into the building was at the top of the building.
Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building.
The alarm was situated at the top.
So they could take their time, rather than going in through the front door.
As soon as Mallory stole the diamond, he ran away.
Unfortunately the guard saw him.
By the time he got out of the building, the cops were everywhere but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his unpredictable mind.
He ran into the old building, and hid a diamond in there.
Unfortunately, the building was a police station.
I am writing to complain about your show "Over the rainbow" and the conditions in which it is performed.
I was having a week's holiday in London when I decided to go to the theatre and see a musical .
I had read your advertisement in a newspaper and the show seemed very attractive to me.
Moreover an English friend of mine had told me that it would really be a good show as Danny Brook was a very good actor.
No need to say how much I was disappointed to see that another actor was performing instead of Danny Brook and the actor didn't seem to have rehearsed the role very much.
At the end of the show, I decided to have dinner in your theatre restaurant and I went there ...only to find that it was closed because it was being repainted.
To sum up, it was not the "perfect evening out!" you advertised.
So I am asking you to pay me back at least half of the ticket price for the inconvenience that was caused me.
I hope that you will understand my request and reply to me in a positive way by sending me a cheque to my address in France (see the letterhead).
We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets from each other.
At that time, I used to buy a lottery ticket once a week and I sometimes won small amounts.
One day, while I was checking my weekly ticket, I found out that I had five numbers out of six so that I would surely get a substantial amount of money.
I had to wait ten days before the lottery head office would give me the cheque and one week before I could learn how much I had won.
But I was too excited to keep it secret so I told Pat that I had won a prize for five correct numbers and had her swear not to tell anyone.
But soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and I found out that I had many unsuspected friends...
Not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
Well, they all seemed to be so different and behaved in such an unusual way each time they saw me that I began to think that they knew something about me.
Finally the end of the week came and I went to the lottery office to find out the amount I had won.
I was very disappointed to learn that I'd only won three hundred francs because a lot of people had had five numbers like me.
SO I told my friend Pat how much I had won and the following day at school everybody was just the same as they ever were with me...
It was written in the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to star with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who starred.
That disappointed me and the people who just went to see him.
And regarding the time, the show was meant to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15.
Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes.
Also, it was said there would be discounts on the tickets but I had nothing like this.
All the people there paid the same amount of money.
After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It was a big mistake to tell her a secret, especially an important one.
It all started two years ago.
Rod was a happy man at that time.
One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange men, who he ran after and one of whom he caught.
Just then, the strange man took out his gun.
Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself with his own gun.
Nobody saw and nobody heard what had happened.
Rod told this to nobody, except Pat, his best friend.
One day, when they were arguing, Pat was very and told what she knew to the police.
Rod was arrested that day and was sent to prison.
He was then killed by the other man who escaped that day and was caught soon afterwards.
My name is Furilo J.M.
and last month I spent a few days in London; I visited your theatre.
The reason I'm writing this letter to you is that during my stay in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre.
When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone who actually didn't appear; I noticed that in the show, there was someone completely different to him so I felt bad.
Moreover, this complaint is not only about the actor, whoever , the problem is that the show started too late.
I arrived there at 19:00 and the show began at 20:15.
When I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't get any discount like the one that was written on the folder.
After the show I wanted something from the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed.
After all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad.
I think I can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the money I spent there, and some more for all the problems I had.
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on his mind.
Every person in the world looks to technology every day to improve the way they live their own lives.
We young people don't remember when technology wasn't part of our daily life, but our parents, or grandparents remember it well from when they were young, and everything was made in a different way.
For example our parents didn't have computers at home when they were teenagers.
Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer in your house, and when you have to do some homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to school.
Also you can search for new subjects on the Internet.
Finally, technology is a word that we will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how , or at what speed, it will develop in the future.
Maybe, technology will never stop advancing and our life will never work without computers.
I am writing this letter referring to the show "over the Rainbow" you put on on the 10 of this month.
I read your advertisement five days before, and I was really impressed by it.
But, the quality of this show wasn't what you led me to believe it would be, and I feel really disappointed by it.
I want to give you some details about my feelings.
First of all, you advertised a cast including Danny Brook, but he wasn't there! Secondly, the show should start at 19.30, and in fact it started 45 minutes late.
Then, I am a student, and when I bought my ticket, there weren't any discounts.
Finally, I had hoped that I could have dinner in the restaurant after the show, but, to make me totally disappointed, it was closed, and I had to find another restaurant at 22.00.
So you can imagine how satisfied I am by your claiming it would be a"Perfect Evening".
For all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, I would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
My marks weren't good enough to obtain my degree in Computer Science, and the exam session was finished.
There was no way to obtain the diploma.
You need more explanations from me to understand my motivation at the end of this story.
In fact, I did this kind of study because of my interests in programming.
The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam .
That's why I decided to hack into the teacher's computers to change all my marks.
I never talked about this project to anyone, except my best friend Pat.
At the end of the exam session, all students and teachers meet together for a big party, to celebrate .
During this party, Pat drank too much.
And when he was totally drunk, he started speaking.
Then, the teachers made copies of their files, and my project wasn't possible anymore.
So congratulations everybody.
And I think I will still be here next year.
Firstly, we got our tickets at your ticket office just one hour before the show.
We thought, as usually we do in London theatres, we could get discounts, and it's written on your advertisement .
Surprisingly, there were no discounts.
In the end, the restaurant was closed because you didn't have enough staff that evening!! .
We really like London, the people, the night-life but this evening was really awful.
I have sent you a photocopy of our tickets.
Would you please return our money .
In advance, thank you.
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I come to your theatre.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
When her best friend, Scala, asked her for an idea to surprise her husband with because she was pregnant, Pat put her foot in it just before Scala's husband had the surprise.
The problem is that Pat works in Neubathin, a little village.
She's a secretary in an office.
Everybody knows everybody.
Pat and Scala have been good friends for 10 years, their husbands too.
It was a sunny Friday afternoon, Scala was really excited about telling her the news.
Despite the fact she knew that Pat couldn't keep a secret, this time she was confident that maybe she would be able to.
Just after Scala told her the news, Pat phoned her mother who worked in a bakery, to tell her that Scala was pregnant.
He was so amazed and asked her to repeat .
She just remembered it ought to be a secret, and she became really embarrassed.
When he went back to his house, his wife gave him the box with the shoes but it wasn't a surprise! Scala was angry with Pat because she thought she could keep this kind of secret.
I am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
Firstly we arrived at 19.15 to be in time for the show, which should have started at 19.30.
However, it started at 20.15 and we were all very disappointed.
Furthermore, it's written in your advert that Danny Brook is in the play and that was one of the main reasons why we went.
Imagine how disappointed we were when we found out that he had been replaced.
Besides, when we wanted to buy our tickets we were hoping that the discount was available.
Unfortunately, it wasn't and we couldn't afford to buy everyone a ticket.
Finally, we had planned to eat dinner after the show at the theatre restaurant and we were very disappointed when it turned out to be closed.
Therefore, as you may understand, I'm asking for a refund.
These kinds of misadventures can easily ruin your reputation.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and the rumours about me stealing soon reached the director's office.
I was sent a letter in which it was written that the director wanted to meet me and my parents.
Sweating and afraid I waited outside the director's office the following day.
I was unable to imagine what would happen to me if my parents knew what I had stolen.
'You may enter,' said the director.
Tears ran down my face as I admitted having stolen.
I was surprised that my father didn't watch me but I soon understood that he was ignoring me.
During the trip home none of us spoke.
We just sat calmly waiting for this nightmare to be over.
The purpose of this letter is to complain about my experience with the musical "Over the Rainbow", which really disappointed me.
First of all, there were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so I had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
Then, I was forced to wait forty-five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and, when it finally started, I was really disappointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
So, as you can see, it wasn't my perfect evening out at all.
That's why I demand you send me my money back.
Since the beginning of human life, people have invented ways to make their lives easier.
That is not different from now.
We live surrounded by inventions which help as through the day.
From the vehicle we use to move faster to the light bulb we use at night, we constantly depend on these inventions to be able to do the things we have to do.
That's why modern technology is so important in our daily lives, because it helps to make our lives easier and to do what we have to do faster so then we can use our time better.
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement in the newspaper.
I am disappointed because of the horrible evening I have had.
I was on holiday in London and I did not have enough time to spend there, but when you said that your show was the best I decided to go.
When I bought my ticket I asked for a discount and they said none was available.
At first it was not a problem because if the show was going to be the best I would pay what they asked.
I arrived at the theatre in time and the musical started later than I expected so I was getting irritable because I very much dislike lateness, but that was not all.
When the show started the person who was acting in it was not Danny Brook and the replacement didn't seem to be an actor.
Really he was bad.
Afterwards I decided to go for a meal in the theatre restaurant but It was closed.
So you can imagine how I felt because of the irritating evening out I had.
I am let down by your behaviour.
You wanted to cheat me, so I will be very pleased if you could give my money back.
I am looking forward to your answer.
I think technology has changed my life and the way of life of almost everyone around the world.
First of all, technology is very useful nowadays but really I dislike it because in some ways we are becoming machines too.
Since the creation of PCs, people - and me too, of course - have been doing different things.
For example we can buy food, clothes and whatever we need by Internet or by telephone.
I can find out what is happening in different parts of the world in a few minutes.
A very good aspect of this change is that women have more freedom to work because before we had the technology they had to stay at home doing housework but now we have laundries and a lot of machines like microwave ovens.
Personally I dislike computers.
I don't know how to use them but I know I have to change because they help to make our lives easier.
On the other hand what will happen to us in the future? Our lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us at work.
Something that I note about technology is that we are losing green places and there is a lot of pollution, so we have to be careful.
I'm writing to complain about a musical show which I've seen recently at your theatre.
There are several reasons why I wasn't satisfied with it.
Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that a famous actor, Danny Brook, would act in the show.
Despite that, a different actor starred in the performance, which was really disappointing.
Secondly, the beginning of the show was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be.
Thirdly, no discounts were made when I was buying the tickets.
Lastly, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show.
That evening wasn't my perfect one , although it was promised to be so in the advertisement.
This is the main reason why I want to ask for a refund.
In my opinion, this would be quite fair.
Over the centuries man's clothes have been changing and even developing in some ways.
People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose.
They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in.
Nowadays people wear more ordinary clothes.
I think we can draw a conclusion: over the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more ordinary.
People's clothes have been changing from armour to shorts and miniskirts.
That's why I suppose that man's clothes will be becoming lighter and lighter.
I think, they will be made of universal materials, which will be rather light and thin.
People won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of their bodies.
Perhaps, clothes will be rather small.
I think, that different tops and mini-skirts will become more popular.
Maybe, people will create something even smaller than that.
Who knows what will happen in the future? Perhaps, armour will become a craze again.
Introduction: It seems to me that modern technology has profoundly changed our daily life.
The computer is everywhere and it's available for everyone.
A useful helper: the personal computer can quickly help you in lots of situations.
Moreover, a variety of micro-computers are now everywhere such as in your car, on your radio and so on.
Feel good about it!: on the one hand, modern technology is extremely important, on the other hand you shouldn't abuse it.
Conclusion: I do think, however, that modern technology is essential for human beings nowadays.
Although the world of computers will develop day by day, I hope we (human beings) can maintain our way of seeing things.
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show.
It was advertised as London's Newest and best musical show.
However, it was a very disappointing evening for me.
Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
Secondly, there was a delay with the show, which was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20:15.
This really upset me as no notice was given before the show.
Thirdly, the advertisement said that discounts were available but the ticket seller said that there was no discount available.
In addition, the advertisement mentioned that the restaurant would be open after the show but it was closed because .
Finally, I would like to ask for my money back on the ticket due to the disappointing evening out and the misleading advertisement you have .
Nowadays, modern technology is becoming absolutely essential to our daily life.
It is another important factor which affects our life, apart from money, health, food and housing.
The reasons it is important to us are, first of all, without computers, communication technology and transportation , we wouldn't be able to process information and data so quickly.
Secondly, no one could communicate on the phone as quickly as nowadays.
Lastly, it would take people months and months to travel to the other side of the world and also the journey would be much more dangerous than travelling by plane.
Without all this your life would definitely change back to 50 or more years ago.
To put it in other words, modern technology has changed our life to became more advanced in every way.
On the other hand, the effects that it has on our daily life are not always good as sometimes the technology goes wrong and can cause disastrous accidents, for example: plane crashes, train crashes and the explosion of nuclear bombs.
If this continues to happen our life will be very miserable as accidents happen all the time.
Therefore, it is important to get it exactly right.
I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice.
The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show.
The things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the whole show very bad.
Also the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but it finally started at 20.15 and that is such a waste of other people's time.
Another thing was that you said discounts are available, which is very important for students, but no, there weren't any.
Also after the show your restaurant was closed because there weren't enough staff.
To be honest that was not a great experience and I hope you will see my point.
In that case I also want to ask you for my money back.
I think you will understand that and I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Since everyone can afford modern technology everyone's life in the more developed countries has changed completely.
We can't imagine living without it anymore because we are so dependent on it.
It starts in the morning when we are woken up by the sound of an alarm clock, then in the bathroom we have running hot water and also the whole house is warm due to central heating.
Then we can just go to the fridge where all the fresh food is stored ready to eat.
If we then want to go to work we don't have to get our horse, no, we get the car keys and go wherever we want to.
At work we have the most important thing in the world of technology, the computer.
Without that we couldn't do anything today.
I am writing to express my annoyance at your musical show, which happened to be .
Your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny Brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unknown actor who starred instead of him.
Another point which caused some was the show's timetable.
It began 45 minutes later than it should have .
Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount on my ticket, it happened to be impossible to get one.
Although your leaflet suggested that your theatre restaurant would be open that was not the case because of a lack of available staff.
All those inaccuracies spoilt what should have been a memorable evening so I would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Of course, it was my fault.
I should have known better but I had to tell  someone.
It was far too hard to keep it to myself.
So I made a mistake and I told her.
The day after, at school, I noticed that everyone was looking at me.
I immediately knew that something was wrong so I had a word with Pat.
She denied having revealed my secret but she was avoiding my eyes.
From this moment, I knew without the shadow of a doubt that my mother would know about it sooner or later.
It was only a question of hours before my life would collapse.
I tried to take it in my stride but I couldn't.
I was terrified.
My fear turned out to be justified.
I read the hurt in her eyes.
She knew.
She knew that I had bought my first bra without having asked her for advice beforehand .
I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another, horrible young actor.
I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to get a discount on the ticket.
We asked for it and we were told that there was no discount either for her or anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.
Furthermore, it was supposed to start at 19.30 p.m.
and it started at 20.15 p.m.
for reasons no one would explain to the audience.
In conclusion, I would be very grateful if you could send me my money back because, as you have seen, I didn't have the "perfect evening" you advertised.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Although he had promised Lise that he wouldn't say a word, when he reached the school he told the secret to Ann.
Of course, Ann promised not to tell anyone, but by lunch time all the school knew that Lise had stolen the literature exams.
Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates.
She would give them the exam's questions and they would do all her homework for 3 weeks.
There was no escape.
It was an unfair deal, but if they wanted the questions they had to accept, and if they accepted, they couldn't tell the teachers anything, because, in fact, they were as guilty as Lise.
I'm writing just for one reason, to inform you how bad the present production is, called "OVER THE RAINBOW".
First of all, in the description of the show, the star was Mr.
DANNY BROOK, and it wasn't.
Another thing was the time of the performance; the show started forty-five minutes late.
So try to imagine my situation.
I had paid a lot of money and I didn't see a good show.
I am really disappointed.
When the play, "over the Rainbow", finished I tried to eat something, but the fact was that the theatre restaurant was closed, because your personnel were cleaning all the mess that an old dog made.
But, the principal reason for this letter is to ask for some money back.
I think that would be best for everyone, and I'd like to give you some advice; if somebody pays you for a ticket, try to give the best you can.
Hoping to hear from you.
Many years ago, more or less seventy years ago a young man, with an excellent capacity for thinking and inventing things, started building a big thing called a "time machine".
He worked day and night.
One month later, his work was complete, but he was afraid to test his machine, so he called Pat and spoke to him about it.
The only thing Pat had to do was to choose a date, one he liked, and to press the starter button, and you know what? He did it! The machine worked really well.
The fact was that Pat chose to go to the year 2000, and when he arrived, he told everyone that he was the inventor.
That's why Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I'm writing this letter to complain about the show which I saw at your theatre.
During my stay in London, I read your advertisement and planned to enjoy seeing the musical show.
I had expected that I would have a wonderful night.
I felt so uncomfortable and the night was not perfect at all.
I insist you refund all the money that I wasted in your theatre.
For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is a freezing morning.
We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house.
The housework doesn't take much time thanks to electrical equipment.
And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad.
Further, we can get a lot of information with the Internet.
In addition, we can travel anywhere in the world in a few days.
These are the advantages which modern technology has brought us.
But I must accept that there are some disadvantages arising from technology, as well.
The biggest disadvantage is pollution.
days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern lifestyle.
Air pollution from cars, Soil pollution from industrial waste.
The sea is also polluted by oil and the chemical detergents which are used in the home.
Even food is polluted.
All these facts mean that our modern life causes great damage to the earth.
All of us must notice this fact.
And we should in order to save our precious earth.
I am writing to complain about your advertisement which gave me wrong information.
While I had a holiday in London I went to your theatre to see "Over The Rainbow", but I had a very disappointing evening.
Thirdly, I saw "Discount Available" on your advert but your staff said it was just for Mondays.
Your advert made me misunderstand.
Finally, we visited your theatre restaurant after the show.
However, it was closed because it was being decorated.
Your advert promised me a "Perfect evening out", but it was a terrible evening for me.
So I want you to give me a refund.
When I bought my computer, I wasn't interested in it but when I started studying the Internet and playing games, I found it interesting.
Sometimes, I think I am a computer addict because whenever I come back home, my hand goes to the computer switch, automatically, even though I don't want to use the computer.
I usually spend my time on playing computer games about three hours a day.
After that, I go to the sofa to watch TV.
Although there aren't programmes which are interesting, I just watch TV, so my mother calls me "Couch Potato".
I write this letter to inform you about the bad experience I had last week at one of the shows your are putting on.
I received a in which I was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages I would get if I went to see it.
I wish that had never happened.
I am really disappointed, and I want to have my money back.
First of all, on the sheet I received, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors.
That is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and I don't know what his name is.
Second, it says that the play would start at 19:30, and it actually started at 20:15.
Third, I was told that I could get a discount, and when I was buying my ticket the lady in the kiosk told me that that discount didn't exist.
After that, when the show was finished, I was going to the theatre restaurant, and a man that works there told me that it was closed, and he didn't want to give me a reason.
You must understand that you promised me I'd have a good evening and I really didn't .
So I suggest you give me my money back, or I will go to the police, because you lied to me and you know what that means.
I write this letter to tell you about the programme that starts tomorrow, about that excellent book I have told you to read.
This excellent book tells the story of a man of 25 years that has a little boy, his son, that lives in a very bad .
The story shows you the life that many people have to deal with every day.
It shows you how they face it and what life is, real life.
The book is very easy to read, but if you don't have time I recommend listening to the programme.
I have been told that they will interview a lot of people that have read the book, and who will talk about their experience.
Also, that they will invite a psychologist, the author of the book and maybe the president will talk so I recommend you listen to it.
I hope you listen to it, because I think that if you want to become an M.P., it will teach you a lot of things, and you will learn more about English reality.
I recently had a week's holiday in London, so I went to the theatre to see a musical , 'Over the Rainbow', at 'The Circle Theatre', where you are the manager.
I had a terrible evening, so there were a lot of faults in the event of last Saturday: The first point, the show started at 20:15 (it was late).
The second point, the principal actor was changed.
The third point was that the discount tickets were unavailable and, finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because the oven was broken and we couldn't enjoy ourselves there after the musical .
I would be grateful if you could send me my money back because it was a horrible evening for my family and it wasn't a perfect evening out.
Science and technology have changed my everyday life.
Modern technology is used all the time at home, at school or while working.
When I was a child I didn't use the computer because I didn't know what it was .
, I can work with it in my office and visit some website using the new technologies such as the Internet.
Life is more comfortable with all the new machines you can use at home, or at the office, or new technology helps us to live with all the new medical machines in the hospitals.
The new inventions have transformed my life, so it is easier with modern technology (the mobile, the car, the plane, the coach, the train, the medical advances and domestic appliances), they have created more comfort and pleasure.
I am writing to complain about the musical show I went to last week.
I spent a week's holiday in London and I had been looking forward to seeing a wonderful show in your theatre.
However, I was completely disappointed with it.
Firstly, although I bought a ticket for 19:30 the show started at 20:15.
That would never happen in my country I must say.
Secondly, there were no discounts despite your claiming they were available in your advertisement.
Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on strike.
On top of everything, the main actor, Danny Brook, did not appear in the show.
The actor who appeared instead of him was terrible.
In fact, I expect a full refund plus compensation for the .
I trust you will give immediate attention to this letter and I look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week.
When we think about clothes in the future, we should think about the environment first.
What will it be like in 2100? It is not pleasant to say the earth is now facing some serious problems.
But it is a fact.
Air-pollution might become more problematic than now in the future and the destruction of the ozone layer .
Considering these facts, we should wear clothes which can protect us from certain kinds of and air pollution.
I suppose they would be like .
Of course, technology will have developed enough for us to invent new material for those kinds of clothes.
So we don't have to worry about how heavy they will be.
We will feel as if we wore nothing.
In conclusion, in 100 years clothes will not be as fashionable as they are now.
We should consider .
I have just returned from my holiday in London.
During my stay I went to see a musical show at the Circle Theatre and I had a very disappointing evening.
Firstly, I expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but I felt very angry when I saw different actors.
What is more, you advertised there were discounts available but there were not.
You said that the musical show started at 19.30 but it began at 20.15.
I was very bored because I did not have anything to do when I was waiting for your show.
You promised us a big show and a perfect evening but it was only an average show with unknown actors.
In my opinion, you are not very and responsible.
I will never trust you again.
I would like you to give me my money back as soon as possible.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
As I remember, I have known her for ever.
She had always been my best friend and I had told her everything.
We lived in the same street and we spent the weekends together.
When I was 16 years old I fell in love with the most handsome boy in our school.
Paul was older than me and he played basketball.
Only Pat knew about my lover.
One day he invited us to his party.
I was very happy and nervous.
Everything was great.
But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me.
Everybody started to laugh at me.
I was angry and I ran away to the forest.
'She was my best friend, how can she do it to me?' - - I was crying.
When I was walking through the forest I saw a very tall man who was standing in front of me.
'My name is Jon' - he whispered - 'Don't be afraid'.
We started to talk.
This stranger was so intelligent and funny that I forgot about my troubles.
We talked all night and I fell in love with him.
We met again and again and now Jon is my husband.
Maybe it was good that Pat was so talkative.
I'm sorry to tell you that I'm really disappointed with your advertisement for the musical show at the Circle Theatre.
First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, which disappointed me very much.
Also, the show didn't start on time, it started half an hour late.
And you had written in your advert that there would be discounts available, which weren't available that evening.
After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of the inside the restaurant.
Finally we did not have a perfect evening at all! And because of these circumstances, I would like to have a part of my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Because he likes to tease people.
So, it was last summer, we were on a short trip with our class to an adventure park.
We had a lot of fun.
Until we came to a big cave, where you could walk through.
It was quite scary for me, but I said to myself, come on you can do it.
I walked in first with Pat and two of my friends.
But suddenly, there were only Pat and me left.
We lost the others.
So I tried not to get in a panic, but had no chance.
I was so worried I would not find the way out that I started to scream and cry.
First, Pat started to laugh, but as he realized that I didn't stop crying, he comforted me until I calmed down.
And after a while we found the way out.
I asked him not to tell anybody that I cried.
He said, 'Sure, no problem'.
But next day, back in the classroom, some of the students looked at me and started to laugh.
After that it was all clear, Pat and secrets.
I am writing this letter to you, because the show "Over The Rainbow", which is London's newest and best musical show, was not...
for me.
Please excuse me, but there were many mistakes and problems on the , which disappointed me very much.
I thought that Dany Brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in that show.
And I was really disappointed when I saw Jeremy Brook on the stage.
Please, if you would be so kind correct this mistake.
I would be grateful if you could correct too .
Another thing was that there were no discounts available, and that the restaurant, which I wanted to visit after the show, was closed because of .
I would be very grateful if I could get my money back.
That evening, which should have been my perfect evening out, was in fact very tiring and boring.
.
I would be grateful if you could give us our money back.
If I cannot get a satisfactory reply within a month I shall go to the consumer protection organisation to sue you.
I have been a music enthusiast for a long time.
I used a tape player and I felt it was excellent.
Today, there are many choices, such as a discman (CD player), MD walkman and MP3 player, which are considered to be more portable and have a better sound quality.
 we can simply make a phone call, and send e-mails or faxes instead of writing letters and waiting for a long time.
In particular the improvement in the sophistication of personal computers has greatly helped the spread of information.
By using the Internet, you can newspapers and magazines, and even go shopping online.
Therefore, our life has been influenced and changed by the development of technology.
In conclusion, we should work hard to acquire knowledge to make the future better and better.
However, all my expectations failed to come true.
First of all, I found that no discounts on tickets were available although you mentioned them in your advertisement.
Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30.
And, finally, right before the start they announced that Danny Brook would not be in the show that evening.
So he was replaced by another actor.
After the show I was not surprised at all to learn that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration.
, I have to say that I got something completely different from what I had expected to get.
In connection with that I ask you to refund the money I paid for my tickets.
I really hope it will not take you long to settle the matter.
Undoubtedly, modern technology has changed my daily life.
And the best word I can use to describe all the changes is "drastic".
Every aspect of my life is being constantly influenced by achievements of science and technology - health, work, household, interaction with other people, etc.
Among the greatest inventions of man I come across daily are the telephone, computer and automobile.
At any time of the day I may contact any person in any part of the world over the phone.
It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousands of kilometres away from me.
The computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get access to informational sources through the Internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
The automobile saves me time when I'm travelling.
All the above and many other achievements of modern technology make my life more convenient, comfortable, effective and fun.
But that is not the end.
Scientists continue research into new technologies, such as lasers, digital technology, and genetic engineering.
And I'm sure all those will set new, better standards for my way of living.
First of all, it is said that the stars are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actor was not Danny Brook.
The show should have started at 19.30.
However it started at 20.15.
We were kept waiting for 45 minutes.
The tickets were sold for £10, £15 and £20.
We were told that discounts were available but they were not.
We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed for cleaning.
We had expected a brilliant show but we were very disappointed.
I think the people who came there should be reimbursed.
People used to wear very different things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that they are 'clothes'.
We would probably think that these things they wore were just to cover and protect themselves.
Nowadays the aim of clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves.
People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes.
The things that people wear are changing all the time, everyone tries to be different in public and very different sorts of clothes are being created.
The things we wear may not seem like 'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now.
I believe they will wear very different things.
I am writing to complain about the musical show, which a very disappointing evening, while I was staying in London.
Firstly, there was a different actor instead of the famous actor Danny Brook.
That left me so disappointed.
Secondly, I thought the show would start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
It caused me to miss the train and I went back to the hotel when it was nearly midnight.
Another problem is I thought that discounts were available.
However, there wasn't any discount.
Additionally, the advertisement said I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show.
When I arrived, it was closed.
It is so annoying that everything was changed without any notice.
I expect to receive my money back within two days.
Otherwise I to take further action.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I told Pat everything even my secrets when we were still friendly.
However, we are not friends anymore because of a secret .
It is a very long time since I was in Year 7.
I told Pat that my father and mother were going to separate.
I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feelings.
Maybe it was the wrong decision to tell her.
She began to share that secret with everybody, including the teachers.
They tried to contact my parents.
My parents were very angry when they realised what had happened.
All my friends were trying to keep their distance from me.
That was all because of Pat.
Finally, I decided to go to another school and I will not tell any secret to anyone.
I'm writing you this letter because yesterday I went to the theatre to see the musical and I had many problems, so I demand my money back.
First of all, when I paid my entrance fee they didn't accept my discount ticket, they told me that the ticket was fake, then I entered the theatre and I had to wait 45 minutes.
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this shows a lack of respect".
When the show started the billing was wrong because it said that actor Danny Brook and Tina Truelove appeared and Danny Brook didn't act, it was another actor that nobody knew, "Really this is very disappointing".
After the show I planned to go to the restaurant with my wife, but what do you think happened? "The restaurant was closed".
Manager, I expect that you have considered my bad experience at your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because it was a very bad evening.
Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate.
The class had organized a secret party for our friend Nick who was leaving the school in 2 more weeks.
It all started when Pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house.
Most of the class disagreed with that because the Pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him that his house was like a box.
Pat got very angry and sad.
Pat, affected by this situation, told Nick all about the situation and the class secret.
At first Nick got angry but then he forgave him because they were friends and each of them could trust in the other.
Nick told the situation to the class and offered his house for the party, because it was very big, with large gardens and a big swimming pool.
The day of the party everyone had fun, especially Pat who to start with was sad.
I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see "Over the Rainbow" - the musical .
At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement for the show, however, it was misleading.
First of all, the advertisement for the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage.
However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot.
Apart from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
Another thing I would like you to know is that there were no special rates on the price of the ticket, which cost me £20.
Also, the theatre restaurant had closed down before I left the show.
Finally I would like to inform you that I have never had such an unpleasant evening in my whole life.
Therefore, I would be very grateful if you - the manager of the theatre - could send me the money back, at least the money I spent on the ticket.
Unfortunately Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He was one of my best friends, but all secrets told to him spread throughout the school in a matter of minutes.
The worst was that he did it unconsciously.
When we were at primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) on his 10th birthday by arranging a fancy dress party at the school.
We had been preparing it for three days, we hired fancy dress, had a cake made by a cook and decorated the gymnasium.
Unfortunately, it was me who had to tell Pat about the surprise.
Later, I realised it was the worst thing that could happen to me.
On the day of the party, half an hour before it started, Pat came across with a gang of boys from another .
Since they were going to beat him up, he desperately told them everything he knew about the party.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
We sometimes tried to throw surprise parties, but it never worked because of him.
Two weeks before his birthday he started asking us what we were going to do.
That annoyed us so much that we started making something up.
We told Pat we couldn't have a party on his birthday, because everyone except me had something to do.
Of course, that wasn't true, we had actually organised a party for him with all his friends a long time ago, but he wasn't supposed to know that.
On his birthday all our friends were at my place, waiting for Pat.
I had invited him to spend the evening with me.
But half an hour before he should have been there he phoned me and said he was too tired to come.
I couldn't change his mind although I tried everything.
In the end I just told him the truth.
He was very sorry that he had not wanted to come and arrived quite soon then.
But I know now that it is always better not to lie even if it is for a good reason.
I am writing to complain about a musical show put on in your theatre.
Indeed, I recently spent a week's holiday in London and I went to the theatre to see "Over the Rainbow".
It was really a very disappointing evening.
I hope you can imagine my great disappointment.
Therefore, I would like to ask you to refund me my entrance fee, as this evening did not correspond to your advertisement.
Science and technology have played an important role for the last twenty years and the development of modern technology has especially affected our lives.
To sum up, there are many other discoveries related to modern technology which affect my daily life.
However, it would take too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you are also familiar with them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life.
Having seen your musical show last Sunday, I am writing to complain about the problems and to ask for some money back.
I am sure you can imagine what I felt.
It was not a perfect evening for me and my child at all! I am also sure you can refund my money.
I know you are always interested in detective stories, especially Agatha Christie's.
Don't be surprised! Her best detective stories are going to be read on the radio this Sunday evening at 18:00.
I'm sure you'll be pleased.
You are supposed to listen to them.
Where the stories are concerned, they will not be difficult to understand because you already know the stories and the narators are going to read clearly.
What I'd like to say is you should listen to them.
I write to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I had a very disappointing evening because of many things.
First the actor was a very average actor.
Then it starts 45 minutes late.
Also in the advertisement they talk about discount tickets.
Well they didn't accept my £20 discount ticket.
Why? And finally I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant after the show, it was closed.
Why? I don't know.
Also I wanted to tell you that the show was very boring.
It was always the same.
And it was too slow.
Because of all these things it obviously wasn't the perfect evening as was said in the advertisement.
So I wrote this letter to ask for my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because after I told her that I had a new girlfriend, all the school knew it in less than 2 hours.
I had to explain to everybody that I actually didn't have a girlfriend.
I explained to them that it was a good possibility, nothing else, but no one believed me, because Pat had told them that I had an actual girlfriend.
This problem with Pat had a lot of consequences, because I had a very heavy discussion with her about it.
It was so heavy that one of our teachers had to calm me down, because I was very angry with her.
The teacher sent me to talk with the principal, who suspended me for using bad language with a girl.
So I was suspended, I had a fight with one of my best friends, all because she wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Last week, I visited your theatre and I was very disappointed because I did not have a perfect evening out like your advertisement said.
I would like to complain about four things concerning your theatre.
First thing, the actor is really horrible so I recommend you change the actor because he will disappoint an audience who visits your theatre.
Second thing, you should open the show on time because if the audience have to wait, they will not feel happy.
But I think you know that.
After the show I was very hungry so I went to the restaurant in the theatre but it was closed for refurbishment.
That made me very angry and disappointed.
To conclude, your theatre is so I would like to ask for some money back.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Nowadays, science and technology are very important to our life.
The technology changes my daily life a lot .
For example, when I was young, I used to walk to school every day but now my father has a car so I don't have to walk anymore, because my father gives me a lift every day.
At home, I have a video game so I play it all the time and I'm very glad that it makes my daily life happy so it's excellent but on the other hand I don't do any homework or study at all.
Another example is the computer.
I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can get the news by using the Internet on the computer.
To sum up, modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways.
Therefore my daily life will change in bad ways or goods ways.
It depends on how I use the technology.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW" which I saw on 15th of June in your theatre.
Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK performing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him on that evening.
In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes.
Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20:15.
As for the ticket price, you promised to provide discount tickets, but they were not available.
Furthermore, when I went to the restaurant after the show, I found it was closed because its opening time was from 10:00 to 17:00.
I do not need to tell you, either, that I had an awful evening and you are responsible for that.
So I am asking you to refund all the money.
Thanking you for your prompt attention.
I check my e-mail every day using the Internet, I talk to my friends who are far away by connecting to network systems, and I carry my mobile phone.
In recent years, as Information Technology has been improved greatly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not the same as before.
A few years ago, I did not know what the Internet was, how to use it and so on.
But, while it has spread all over the world, I and all the other people who I have known started to use them.
I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to the library.
I am able to meet my friends quickly on the Internet by just clicking the mouse.
In addition to these things, I can contact anyone who I want to talk to at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed.
It is causing some changes in me.
So, now I would rather send an e-mail than a letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something.
As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster.
Last week, I went to London to see the musical "Over the Rainbow".
I was really happy to be seeing the "Best Musical Show" in London.
But what I saw was exactly the opposite to what I expected.
In other words, it was a disaster.
Maybe you could explain to me what the problems were.
By problems I mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available? But these are only little problems.
The most disappointing thing was that there were different actors to those advertised who were not very good at acting.
And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.
It wasn't really a perfect evening as you promised on your flyer.
I was very disappointed and I would like to have my money back.
Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show.
I will tell everyone I know how bad it was.
Unfortunately, modern technology has made life for many people easier.
If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship.
Today, everyone has the opportunity to just get into a car and drive wherever they want to.
Modern technology also allows you to go onto the Internet to get any information you need.
Production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for the workers anymore.
Everything is controlled and produced by machines.
This is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs.
The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore.
Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they watch TV or play or work on the Computer and don't see each other anymore because they don't have to.
You never get bored.
While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, "Over The Rainbow", because I had read the ad in the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience.
Let me tell you now how everything really was.
It is for these reasons that I expect a full refund of the ticket price.
It is my right as a paying customer to get what I have paid for.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
We can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago.
I think that the life we live is easier than the life our parents lived, thanks to technology.
We can do things our grandparents could only dream of.
The Internet, I think, is one of the most important inventions in the history of humanity.
My life has not been affected or changed by technology, because when I was born, most of the things that I use in my daily life already existed.
But technology is becoming more and more complicated, and new things are invented every day, so I think that our lives will be completely different in forty years.
And, since all these new things only make our lives easier, technology is welcome.
As I thought your advertisement was interesting, I went there but it was not as good as it should be.
First of all, the actor was not Danny Brook as you wrote.
Secondly, it ought to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:30.
According to the advertisement, discounts would be available.
In fact, I had to pay the full price, which cost me £15.
After the show I intended to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed because, though you knew that the show started late, the restaurant had closed before the show finished.
, I think the show was not worth the money I paid, so I want a refund of £15.
Tim, who was the most powerful bully, was punished by his parents and of course by the teachers.
He was furious with Jan, so what happened was Jan was bullied but not because of her .
It was Pat's.
Actually, I think it was right to tell the teachers but not in Pat's way.
It would have been better for both Pat and Jan if they had told the teachers privately and secretly because Tim wouldn't have known who had told the teachers.
Now, Jan is still being bullied nearly every day.
Her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help their child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story.
If all of us try to help her, I'm sure that we can make her school life better.
I visited your theatre and I was very disappointed for a number of reasons.
I've read your advertisement and the reality was different to what was written there.
There was no Danny Brook but instead of him there was a different actor and I'm very disappointed about that because I'm a fan of his.
The show started much later, 45 minutes later than it should have so I was late for the bus.
There were no discounts available so I overspent .
The theatre restaurant was closed for no reason apparent to me.
It was a really bad evening and because of that could you possibly give me my money back? Because it was just a waste of money going to your show.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
But when I came to this school a few months ago I didn't know this.
We are in the same maths set so I met him rather soon.
He was one of the first people who I got to know.
After a few days he was already my best friend.
Everything was going perfectly before last month when I met a girl from the other school.
Her name was Marine.
I saw her as a perfect girl with whom I had fallen in love .
So one day she invited me to come to her house at night and to do so I had to run away from our boarding house and that was illegal.
I had decided to go.
So I woke up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climbed out of the window.
Unfortunately for me Pat at the time was going to the toilet and saw me.
So I asked him to keep it a secret.
I came back at 6 o'clock in the morning and went to sleep again.
Next day my best friend went to the headmaster and told him about me so he put me on suspension.
I visited your theatre a couple of days ago in order to see the musical show titled 'Over The Rainbow'.
I was not satisfied with the show at all because it was very different from the description your advertisement had given.
First, I expected to see Danny Brook but a different actor appeared without any explanation being given.
Secondly, although the show started at 20:15, your theatre restaurant closed at the usual time and I was not able to eat dinner.
I had planned to have dinner there after the show.
What is worse, the ticket price was not reduced despite the fact that I showed my student ID.
Visiting your theatre should have been the most pleasant event during my holiday in London.
I do hope you will understand my feelings and send me some of my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I had known that but I told her my secret, which was a big mistake.
It was just an ordinary day.
Somehow I felt like sharing my secret with her and told her that the new pop singer who was very popular among girls was my cousin.
Pat was very surprised but soon she began asking me lots of questions about him.
I didn't mind telling her about my cousin.
Actually he isn't different from other boys at all.
He is just sweet-looking.
The next day, I went to school as usual and was agog at the large number of girls waiting for me around my locker.
They all seemed to want to be my best friend, and only Pat seemed to be happy to be my best friend.
In your advertisement I read the times of the performances, they were 14.30 and 10.30, however, it started at 20.15! So I was doing nothing for a long time and I don't like to waste my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove? Where were they last weekend? Last weekend at the theatre there was a different actor who was disappointing.
To make the evening worse there were no discounts available on the tickets, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over.
I want my money back.
If you don't give it back to me, I intend to write to the press and tell everything, and of course I won't be the only one.
I am so furious because when I asked for my money back that day, the wasn't able to give it back because he would be sacked.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and he usually made up some extra information.
One day we decided to write a special letter to Pat; in the letter we told him that we had fallen in love, we were a beautiful girl with long hair and green eyes (like the women Pat likes).
The only problem was that the girl was too shy to speak to him, she wanted to keep her name a secret, and if Pat told someone something about the letter, she wouldn't say who she was.
Poor Pat, he was so happy because a girl loved him and so nervous at the same time, even biting his nails.
As I said at the beginning Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told us that he had a love letter but we couldn't read it.
Three days later we sent him another letter, and Pat told us again but we said, "Oh Pat, don't tell us that lie again", so Pat got furious and showed us the letter.
We laughed and explained to him that we were the ones who wrote the letters, and made him promise that when he gets a secret lover, a real one, he won't tell anyone because if he does he won't meet her.
I am writing to explain some aspects of your show.
It was a disaster and I am going to tell you why.
I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, but I had a bad surprise; he was not in the show! How could you change the actors without saying something to the audience.
The show was supposed to start at half past seven and started at quarter past eight.
Forty-five minutes late! It was incredible.
Apart from that, the advertisement mentioned that there were discounts available, and there were not.
It mentioned that visitors could visit the restaurant after the show, too, and we could not because it was closed, and the person who was there said that it was very late and he was not allowed to open the restaurant for us.
I am very disappointed, and if it is possible, I want you to return my money .
I hope that the next time you will put on a better show than the last one.
Technology affects me a lot, maybe more than science, because my daily life is full of objects using high technology, such us television, radio, transport, etc.
But it has advantages as well as disadvantages.
On the positive side, if I am bored, the first thing that I want to do is watch television or listen to music.
And if I want to go shopping or to another city, it is necessary to use the car or public transport.
On the other hand there are disadvantages, too.
Firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although this is our fault.
Secondly for us there are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because I don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
And finally, because I spend a lot of money buying games for the computer, which , too.
To sum up, technology is the best thing in the world, apart from T.V.
I am writing to complain about your service.
Last Sunday I went to the Circle Theatre.
I watched a musical show which was called 'Over the Rainbow'.
I was very disappointed with it, because there were other actors to those advertised who played very badly.
I don't understand why you changed them.
I hoped to see Danny Brook and Tina Truelove as was advertised in an advertisement.
You were meant to start the show at 19.30 p.m.
but you started very late at 20.15 p.m without any explanation to the audience.
Why did you put in the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? They weren't!!! All tickets were sold at the original price.
After the show many people wanted go to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed because someone .
I had a very disappointing evening so I would like to ask for my money back.
I got the ticket for £20.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I knew that but I needed someone who could understand and support me at that moment.
I told her about my pregnancy because she has a friend who works in a hospital as a doctor.
I asked her for help and she promised me she would do everything that she could and keep my secret.
Pat gave me some advice and I decided to have an operation.
Within a week my classmates and teachers started to talk about me.
I knew who had told my secret to everyone.
I got a bit depressed but my parents supported me.
We had a long conversation.
They stopped me having the operation.
I was 15 years old then.
Now I am 16 and I have got a nice baby boy.
My family love him very much and support us.
I still go to school and I plan to go to college next year.
I would like to tell everyone - don't be naive when you share your big secret or problem with someone.
First tell your parents.
I am sure it is the best way.
Of course secrets can be different...
In this uncomfortable situation I am writing to tell you about some irritating problems.
I went today to see Over the Rainbow, and I am very disappointed with the organisation of your theatre.
First of all, when I went to buy my tickets I discovered that the advertisement was saying false things because there wasn't any discount available, but I bought the ticket anyway.
Then, the time stated as the beginning of the show was 19:30 and unfortunately it began at 20:15.
I have already seen other versions of this musical and Danny Brook is a bad actor, .
, when the musical finished I was very , after waiting for the start of the musical and I was disappointed with this version of Over the Rainbow.
Everybody went to the restaurant, which was closed without any explanation.
I am very disappointed with this evening and with this disorganised way of dealing with problems so I am asking for my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He has a best friend, who was more like a brother to him.
They always did things together, and they were the most popular boys in school.
Both were very handsome, played football; they were an example for everybody.
That was before the day when Pat discovered that his brother was gay.
After that their relationship changed.
Pat was very frightened by this situation.
Pat and Ted always had competition, and Ted used to be the best.
He had never failed and people in general liked Ted more.
I don't know why.
This secret was an opportunity for Pat to be the best without any competition but it was a secret that involved his best friend's sexuality, and if Ted had been a normal person it would have been fine but he was an example for all the school.
Unable to keep a secret he told everyone, ended his friendship with Ted.
Now Ted is rejected by everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honesty.
My name is German Schmidt and last week I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
There were some problems we have to speak about.
First, the actor was not Danny Brook, there was a different actor, who I don't know.
In the advertisement for the show it was written that the musical would start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
After the show I wanted to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are on holiday.
And this was not a perfect evening and your theatre was very expensive for me.
I paid £ 160 for eight people and there were no discounts available.
In my opinion you have to give some money back to me.
I think 50% (£80) is enough.
If you don't give me any money back, I will go to the newspaper.
First I will say that our level of technology at the present time is very high but in the future it will be higher.
With the help of some modern technology our daily lives would not be so difficult.
One example in my life is home banking.
With the help of my home computer I can do all kinds of things, with money, with my bank.
Some years ago I had to go to the bank.
The new way is very easy and faster and I can spend my time on other things.
Another example is the modern technology in my car.
Because of modern technology, the safety level of my car is very high.
Finally I would say that none of us can live without modern technology, because modern technology is essential for us in all parts of our lives.
I'm sorry to say this, but your musical show was very disappointing to me.
I was very disappointed.
A lot of things that you wrote in the advertisement are not true.
You wrote that the actor was going to be Danny Brook but he wasn't there.
A different actor was performing and this was very disappointing to everyone.
Also the show did not start at half past seven as it said but at eight fifteen .
Everyone get bored waiting for the show to start.
I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, as it was closed.
After the show everyone ran to get a good seat in the restaurant but everyone was disappointed when they saw the sign which said "Closed for today".
That evening wasn't perfect and I have to say that I want my money back because the show was a disaster.
I'm really sorry to say this but it is the truth.
I hope that you will not make such mistakes again.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat is a friend of mine and we have been friends for almost a year.
She is a very good girl and she can deal with every problem she has.
It was Saturday when I called her and asked her to go for a walk in the park, which was not very far away from our houses.
I had never told her a secret before but this time I was going to tell her.
The secret was about our friend Maria who was very kind to everyone.
I told her that I had heard that Maria had .
Pat told me that she would not tell that to anyone but the other day I learnt that all the school knew about Maria.
I was sure that it was Pat who told  everyone.
After that I had an argument with Pat and then she told me that she told only one person.
I was very sad about what Pat had done and I didn't speak to her for a long time.
But now we are friends again but I will never tell her a secret again in my whole life.
I write you this letter to complain about your musical show.
First of all, the show began three quarters of an hour late: it started at quarter past eight instead of half past seven, which of course was very annoying.
I went to your show to see Mr.
Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appear.
He had been replaced by a really bad actor, of whom I don't even know the name.
I was very disappointed with that change, because Mr.
Brook is one of my favourite actors.
There were supposed to be discounts for the tickets, which appeared to be wrong too.
I had to pay the full price for them, which was quite expensive.
My wife and I had decided to eat at the theatre restaurant after the play.
It turned out to be impossible: the restaurant was closed and we didn't even receive an explanation .
In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot.
First of all, if computers hadn't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of one! I use my computer for many things, such as homework, games, digital video or the Internet.
The development of portable communication systems, such as mobile phones, has greatly changed our way of life.
It is now possible to talk to a friend almost everywhere and anytime, even if we are two thousand kilometres away from each other.
Precision industry has changed my life a lot too.
I go Scuba Diving during the weekends and holidays.
That wouldn't have been possible a century ago, because all our equipment, such as diving computers, tanks or regulators, didn't exist at that time.
I think that we live easier now (thanks to modern medicine) and that our lives will get easier with time.
I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening at your theatre and I would like to explain what the problems were.
Firstly, I read in the advertisement that the actor would be Danny Brook, and this is one of the reasons why I went to the theatre.
But I had a big surprise when I saw that it was a different actor, and I was very disappointed.
Secondly, according to the the times were 14:30 and 19:30.
I preferred to go at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the show started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting for it to start.
Another reason why I was disappointed was that you said there would be a discount available but there wasn't.
Finally, I was planning to visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because a machine was broken.
This was very disappointing.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
The next morning at school everybody was looking at me in a strange way.
Nobody was talking to me except the ten people who I invited to my party.
At first I didn't know why but after a few seconds I realised that telling Pat about my party wasn't a good idea.
I was very angry with her.
I didn't know what to do, I was afraid that I had lost all my friends.
After a few seconds of thought I went straight to Pat.
"Why, why did you do that?" I said.
She looked as if she didn't want to talk to me.
I ignored her, I couldn't do anything now.
Everybody knew about my party and I had invited only ten people.
I was confused.
I wondered why I made the mistake of inviting Pat.
I guess I didn't know that she would have told people.
After much confusion, I decided not to have a party for my birthday so I could get all my friends back.
And that's exactly what I did even though I was alone on my birthday.
It was much more important to me to get all my friends back.
From this experience I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends whom you can trust.
I am writing this letter to complain about how terrible the show performed in your theatre was.
I was interested in the advertisement for the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago.
However, I cannot help saying that it was really a nightmare.
Firstly, you advertised that Danny Brook, who is my favourite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
Furthermore, his performance was really poor.
Thirdly, the only restaurant in your theatre was closed because of renovations.
As a result, I had a totally disappointing evening during my holiday.
So, I hope that i will have my money back.
I will look forward to your reply.
It is certainly true that modern technology has been changing our life a lot these days.
But how does it affect my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of a radio programme, not the sound of an alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news.
On the bus or even on the tube, I can talk with a friend via a mobile phone when I feel bored.
Sometimes I even play some games on it.
study or work, I use the Internet, which is the easiest way to get information from all around the world.
Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time.
Without it, it would take more than one week.
After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi.
In conclusion, modern technology affects my daily life a lot as well as the whole society.
And in my opinion the extent of its affect on human life will be more than this in the future.
During my stay in London, I visited all the most famous places and I enjoyed myself a lot during these days.
I love London's musicals and I read the advertisement for the show called "over the rainbow".
I've gone to many musicals where the main actor was Danny Brook and I can say that he is really good.
It was my last night in London and I decided to go to this show.
When I asked for the price I was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
I showed the advertisement to him and he said it was wrong and I paid the normal price.
I bought the ticket for the second performance and I went to the theatre at seven o'clock.
I had been waiting half an hour outside the theatre when finally it started at a quarter past eight.
I was angry about all of these problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong about the actor's name.
When the show finished I went to the theatre's restaurant and it was closed because it was too late, so I couldn't have dinner there, as was promised in the advertisement.
It wasn't a good evening and I would like to have my money back.
Modern technology has changed my daily life and I'll try to explain how.
Last year I spent ten hours looking for information for my homework.
The subject was "What's happening in Irak?" I started my research in the town's library and all the information I collected was from a local newspaper.
After two hours I thought that all of this information was written from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion.
I used my computer to collect reports from the Internet and I can promise I found so much information that I couldn't analyse it in two weeks.
I can't imagine my parents playing in the street, without watching the TV.
I couldn't live without modern music.
I'm not interested in films without special effects..
And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop coming : the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake from a vending machine without any coins, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more...
The perfect evening out you promised to provide turned out to be really boring and disappointing.
Consequently I think you should give me some money back.
I hope you will make note of this and I look forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat was my classmate and I should add that he was one of my best friends.
I loved and respected him very much, but there was an unpleasant thing about him - he talked too much.
My sister's birthday was coming.
Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy.
We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy.
But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising for her, because she could hardly expect such a present.
We bought a beautiful puppy and were waiting for the party probably even more impatiently than Susie.
But unfortunately Pat didn't manage to keep our secret.
He told her about the present as soon as he saw her.
I'm sure he did it not because he wanted to spoil everything, but because he was so happy and excited that he couldn't act in a different way.
Susie liked the puppy very much, her eyes were shining, but her friends were a little bit sad and disappointed, because they were expecting a completely different ending.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW", which I saw in your theatre on the 5th of June.
I have been very disappointed by the quality of the show and the lies in your advertisement.
Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without any information or explanation being given by the management.
Secondly, I couldn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes late.
In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
The poor boy was only 5 years old and at this age it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret.
So when he heard by chance that my parents were planning to give me a trip to San Fansisco as a present for my birthday, my little brother ran into my bedroom where I was studying and whispered the wonderful news in my ear.
I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate.
But Fred booked a seat on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for one month already.
I am writing to express how dissatisfied I was with OVER THE RAINBOW, which was put on by the Circle Theatre.
First of all, the reason why I bought the ticket was Danny Brook, who is my favourite star, and was going to appear in the show.
However, there was a different actor instead of him, and this was .
Moreover, , we would get a discount price for the ticket, but it was not available.
Although the show was supposed to start at 19.30, it started at 20.15, so I had to wait for an hour.
To make matters worse, because of the late start, the theatre restaurant had already closed when the show finished.
I wonder if you could give me a refund , because the show was very different from what I expected.
I hope you will take immediate action on this.
I look forward to hearing from you in the future.
Science and technology are necessary for our life.
I could say that we cannot survive without them.
Nowadays, technology, especially computer technology, is improving, therefore, we can get .
.
Furthermore, it is possible to treat many patients who have serious diseases more effectively, if we use modern technology in medical science.
However, if we rely on modern technology too much, it is difficult to be independent, because we will tend not to consider or solve a problem by ourselves.
In my opinion, it is great that science and technology improve our life.
, we can use our time more effectively, but we should not rely on these things too much.
Last week I attended the musical "Over the rainbow", and I am writing in order to complain about things that really disappointed me.
First of all, I want to say that in the play there appeared a different actor to the one advertised, despite the fact that the name Danny Brook appeared in the advertisement; that actor was very bad.
Another thing I want to add is that the musical started 45 minutes late.
It was meant to start at 19.30 and it really started at 20:15.
During this time we had to keep seated in the theatre and it was boring and tiring.
Thirdly, when I bought the tickets, I asked for discounts and nobody knew anything about them, so it is false to say there are discounts available.
However, we enjoyed the musical, but while going to have dinner, we saw the restaurant was closed and we had to get the car and come back home very hungry.
I am writing this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening at your musical show "Over the rainbow" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.
First of all, the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook.
He is my favourite actor and the most important reason I went to your theatre.
But at the last minute, without telling us anything, there was a different actor.
This was very disappointing.
Secondly, your famous restaurant was closed.
That was very unpleasant because I had planned a romantic dinner with my wife.
If you had told me your restaurant was going to be closed, I would have made a reservation somewhere else, but you didn't.
And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were no discounts available.
Neither thing agrees with what I read in your advertisement.
For all of these reasons, I hope you can give me my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking of leaving home.
This was a very difficult decision but I had to take it because of my personal situation, all the time shouting and fighting with all my family.
As my girlfriend lived alone I could have stayed with her or just have gone on travelling around the world.
I was thinking a lot about this problem and how to solve it so I needed someone to talk to and Pat had always been my best friend.
But it was a big mistake because she told her mother about it and I don't know how but now my mother knows about it, and she is very worried about me and my future.
And my father thinks a year travelling and living by myself will be very good for me.
Finally, my parents are arguing all the time about different solutions to my problem, and this all thanks to Pat.
I'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show "Over the Rainbow" which I saw yesterday.
I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because after seeing your advertisement I expected more.
The show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement .
I arrived at the theatre at 19:30, found my seat and waited for forty-five minutes, with two hundred other people, for the show to start.
When it finally started I noticed that the famous actor Danny Brook had been replaced by someone who was not as good as him.
Danny Brook was the reason that most people came to see the show.
After some time, a few of them started to leave the theatre.
I was a little more patient so I stayed to watch the whole show, which by the way was the worst I have ever seen.
I don't know why I paid £20 with no discount, which the advertisements said I would have.
Then I thought that I should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that I couldn't say that I had wasted my time by coming here.
I became furious when I saw that it was closed because there weren't any employees to do the work.
So, I went home as fast as I could to write you this letter.
I don't care what you do about the theatre but I want my money back because this wasn't the perfect evening out you promised it would be.
The last forty years, technology has been growing very fast.
First it was used only by the military or by scientists but for the last twenty years modern technology has been found in any house, rich or poor, and it helps people do hard work.
Most houses have many electric devices like a microwave , an oven, a mixer, a dishwasher and many other things which can do a job at the press of a button.
The last ten years computers have entered almost every house, especially in rich countries.
Computers have entirely changed people's lives.
Children can play games on them or watch a film.
There are millions of things you can do with a computer.
You can listen to music and generally use it for fun but the primary reason that computers were invented was for communication.
There are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet.
Millions of people use computers for this reason.
I am writing with reference to a visit I made to your theatre last week.
I know you will understand my frustration and that's why I would like a total refund of my money or at least another ticket that .
Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
However, she was a close friend and I couldn't accuse her of anything else.
I won't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the truth about my strange disease.
He just said there weren't resources to cure it at that moment but...
I burst into tears as did my Mother.
It seemed the end of something lovely, step by step.
I became conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell Pat about it.
I still remember her words: "Don't worry about anything.
My lips are sealed".
I really did trust her when three days after I went to school and I could see I was drawing the attention of everybody.
I couldn't stand being watched and my fury led me straight to Pat.
She tried to apologise but it wasn't enough for me.
My best friend had let me down.
I am writing to complain about the musical show which was held last week.
I feel disappointed because it was different to what was promised in the advertisement.
First of all, the performers should have been Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
However, there were two unknown actors in the show.
I feel most disappointed about this.
The show started at 20.15 but actually it should have started at 19.30.
Moreover, I bought a £20 ticket without any discount and the advertisement mentioned that a discount was available.
And after the show, we went to visit the theatre restaurant.
Unfortunately, it was closed because that day was their day-off.
But I am wondering why it said we could visit the restaurant if you knew it would be closed.
I am afraid it was not the best musical show because .
On the whole, I feel disappointed about the event and I would like to have my money back.
I look forward to hearing your reply.
Thank you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I say this because of the experience I've had with her.
Now, I don't talk to her anymore because I can't stand a person who I trusted betraying me.
I hope she knows that it was her and won't do it again.
I had really looked forward to the show because it was the first time I had seen it in London and I was attracted by your advertisement which looked very exciting.
However, I found it very disappointing.
Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes in my seat, so it made me upset.
Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not the actors who you advertised.
Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all.
For many years scientific and technological breakthroughs have changed our lives.
I think that the more technological developments we have, the more comfortable lives we enjoy.
Amazingly, we can find that there are more and more computer users.
So life is much faster and more convenient than before.
My daily life has also changed a lot through the use of computers or modern technology.
First of all, using a computer is the most important thing for me because I can store my personal records such as diary or expenses and I send E-mail to my friends who live abroad.
I used to write letters but it takes time to arrive there or sometimes disappears, so E-mail is brilliant for my life.
In addition to this, the Internet is quite useful and helpful to have information from all over the world.
Before I go on holiday I use the Internet to book or get details from the travel agency, which means I could save my time and physical energy.
In conclusion, in my opinion, there are many advantages in my daily life at present and I would recommend people learn computers and would like to say "Enjoy your lives".
My name is Alida Fanetti, and I'm writing to you about the musical show which I saw during my stay in London recently.
One evening, while I was walking around the city, I saw a very interesting advertisement, which was about a musical show.
I'm a fan of Danny Brook so when I read his name in the advertisement I immediately decided to go to the show.
The tickets were a little expensive but I was with another TEN people, so when we read "Discounts Available" we expected that the theatre had organised a special discount for groups of people.
It wasn't true; there weren't any discounts.
The show started at 20.15 and not at 19.30 so we were waiting for a long time.
Before the show started, a man said that Danny Brook wasn't there because he was ill.
It was a disaster.
After the show, which wasn't as good as we expected, we decided to go to the theatre restaurant.
It was closed because people in the kitchen weren't ready with the food.
It wasn't a "perfect evening out" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and I would be grateful if you would give us some money back, if that is possible.
I'm writing to you because I have an important thing to tell you.
I read in the newspaper that in the next few days some books of short stories are going to be read on the radio.
A few days ago you told me that you have to read "the old man and the sea" by Hemingway for school; well, on Friday it is going to be read, on frequency 96.7, .
I suggest you listen to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading to you.
I think it's a very good thing that people read books on the radio because it's an opportunity for "busy people" to hear important and beautiful short stories and books.
Well, I think you will be happy if I tell you something about this book.
I read it two months ago and I liked it very much.
It's a sad story but it lets you know about a type of life that you can't imagine really exists.
The old man is a sad person but he loves his life and lives on the beach because he can't go without seeing the sea for a day.
P.S.
Remember 96.7 on Friday at 15.30 p.m.
According to the advertisement, Danny Brook would be starring in the show but it was a different actor.
It was really disappointing! Furthermore, the show started at the wrong time.
It was said that it would start at 19.30 but it did not.
It started forty-five minutes later.
On top of everything, I am on holiday and you can imagine how disappointed I am.
It was not a perfect evening out.
I suppose that you understand my situation, because you did not tell the truth.
I believe that you are directly to blame so give me my money back.
Nowadays modern technology is advancing and it is really affecting our daily life.
Sometimes there are advantages but there are some disadvantages too.
Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster.
Beside this you can talk with a person on the other side of the world via a computer.
It is interesting! Furthermore it helps with housework, at school and you can travel to places very quickly.
So the main advantage of modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier.
On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks.
First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it.
It can cause lots of problems for our health.
A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy.
They get everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future.
To sum up, there are both positive and negative aspects to modern technology, because it can make our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us.
Having seen, with two of my friends, your musical show last weekend at The Circle Theatre, which is called "OVER THE RAINBOW", I am writing to complain about our disappointing evening.
First of all, in your advertisement you refer to discounts that are available, but, when we bought our tickets, one of the employees refused to give us 'student price tickets'.
Despite being forced to buy adult tickets, we were still excited and took our seats, and waited for the beginning of the show.
Usually, the show starts at 19:30, but this time we had to wait until 20:15! In addition to this, it was not the famous actors that you had mentioned in the advertisement performing, so we were disappointed.
Concerning the restaurant, it was closed for renovation.
As a result, I am sure you will understand our annoyance and frustration, so it was not the perfect evening out that your advertisement stated it would be.
Finally, I am writing to request a full refund for my friends and me, because I felt your advertisement was misleading.
What do you think clothes will be like in the future? I'm sure that someone has already thought about it, because fashionable clothes have always been really important for almost all of us.
Let's have a look at different points.
From the past until now, we have been wearing several different types of fashionable clothing, but why? From my point of view, almost all humans would like to be more attractive, so we always think about it.
As a result, clothes are the easiest way to become more attractive.
In addition to this, anyone will agree with me that clothes are the best invention ever.
Furthermore, it's one of the best ways to make money.
First of all, I think we have grown up with technology.
It's difficult for us to recognise the changes in our lives, but we can think about them.
How has it changed my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life more comfortable.
Now I only need to push a button, and things or machines work on their own.
Homework is easier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes.
Everything is faster, and sometimes technology goes so fast that I'm unable to follow it.
Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it makes us think more about our future jobs.
Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things work and that scares me.
I will be useless, because a machine will do all the work.
To begin with , it was not Danny Book who acted in the show, as you wrote.
And then about the tickets, you wrote that there were discounts available but there were not.
We are very disappointed, it was not a perfect evening out for us, therefore we would like to have our money back.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Clothes are a very interesting subject to study.
If you travel around you can see a lot of difference still between different cultures.
First I think that in the future we are going to wear fewer clothes because the climate is going to get warmer and warmer.
Secondly I think we will be mixing clothes from all over the world, because we are travelling around more and more.
And that is nice if you can pick up the best things from all over the world, but on the other hand it is not so nice if every nationality wears the same type of clothes.
Finally in my opinion I wish we would dress more as we did in the past, using natural material.
We must think more about the environment and live closer to nature.
I'm writing in order to let you know how angry I am after having gone to one of your shows.
I went to London for a week's holiday with some friends and every evening we decided to do something in order to enjoy our stay in that beautiful city.
I wish we had never chosen your show.
In fact, after only having gone into the theatre, I realized that the advertisement I had read was probably about another show.
At that point, even if Danny Brook had been there as the advertisement announced, it couldn't have been a more disappointing evening.
Because of all these things, I am asking for my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but I realized that only when it was too late.
What moved me to discover this were the events that happened last month.
I had just quarrelled with Jon, who is my fiance.
At that time we weren't getting on with each other.
So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children, invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking of the consequences.
And there would have been no problems if I hadn't talked to Pat about that evening.
It was only a dinner with a friend and in fact we'd spent all the time remembering our childhood, but probably Pat thought that Peter and I weren't only friends.
So she ran to Jon in order to let him know about the terrible mistake I had made that evening.
He became very angry no matter how hard I tried to tell him the truth.
By the way, I understand I had better trust in nobody.
I'm writing to complain about what happened to me two days ago, during your musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW".
A friend of mine went to see it last May.
He told me to go because the actor's performance was good.
So I decided to buy a ticket, but no discounts were available.
Then with disappointment I noticed that there was a different actor instead of Danny Brook.
Nobody informed me about that.
After the show, my friends and I decided to go to your restaurant, but we were amazed to find it closed.
In conclusion, I am asking for my money back because it wasn't the perfect evening your advertisement promised.
It's true that modern technology has changed our daily life.
In the past, for example, we used to write letters to communicate, but now we send an e-mail, a fax or make a phone call.
Certainly this is easier and faster than writing, but it was nice when you were waiting for a letter.
Nowadays, you get everything immediately , but will it always be a good thing? I think not.
Everyone has to use modern technology carefully, because too much technology could be dangerous.
It could prevent us from thinking and acting freely.
Today there are children who don't know anything about nature and its things.
Probably, because their parents haven't enough time to leave the city and show them nature.
So they prefer to leave their sons watching TV.
Modern technology? Yes, but we mustn't lose our values or our freedom to be with our families.
I was at first, very excited to be seeing the show, because in the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London.
Also it said that I could have a perfect evening there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening.
I want to complain about the ticket.
In the advertisement it said that discounts were available, but when I asked a member of staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one.
After the show I went to the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed.
It was because they closed earlier than usual.
I think they should .
I am very disappointed with everything that happened last week.
I expect this will be possible.
Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes, like T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc.
They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes, like earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hair bands, handbags, shoes, watches, etc.
They like designer clothes and everyone wears different modern clothes in terms of size, colour and shape.
The fashion gradually changed from and it is still changing .
Maybe in 100 years from now, fashion will be totally different.
Everyone may think that in the future people will wear silver clothes like in science-fiction movies.
I think everyone will wear balloons for clothes in the future.
Everyone will wear very colourful balloons .
With balloon clothes they will be able to fly up in the sky.
No one will walk on roads.
They will bounce on roads with their balloon clothes.
In the future they will wear balloon clothes, because .
They will use a special gas inside the balloons to make them fly.
For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals.
This special gas will not be dangerous.
If we use carbon dioxide in our balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about .
This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in the future.
It will save our Earth.
"I'm very unhappy that I have to write you this letter.
I have to do this because things happened which I can't ignore and which disappointed me very much.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
And we knew that from that day on that if he knew anything about our secret we would live in danger of being caught.
We, that is Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me, Hedwiga, had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we wouldn't attack them.
We had this idea first when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school.
It was love at first sight and we were fascinated by the thought of building the same kind of organisation in our town.
Pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "safety-money", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of money in my room.
His mind made up and ready to go to the police he left our house, where me and my friends were just hanging out.
He saw me and told me to my face, "You are a thief and a burglar and I will now go to the police." I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea....
Yeah folks, that was the point I got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "Rossall-School-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
How are you? I went to the musical show "Over the Rainbow" at your theatre last week.
I have got a few things to complain about regarding your theatre.
The first thing is in your note it says that you have Danny Brook in the show.
But in the show, there was another actor.
I was so disappointed, because I came from far away to see Danny Broke.
In the note it also says that the show starts at 19:30, and so I went in at 19:25.
The show started at 20:15, which means it wasted one hour of my time.
The note says that there are discounts available on tickets, but I bought my ticket and your people told me that there is no discount on the tickets.
When the show had finished, I decided to go and visit your theatre restaurant.
But I went there and it was closed for some reason.
I was really hungry and I went to another restaurant as soon as I could.
.
Today, science and technology help us a lot.
For example, in the past, people had to go and get wood, make a fire and cook, but now people can cook in a microwave and do not have to do all the hard work.
Science and technology can give us a better lifestyle or better food.
For example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them.
We can also produce more and better food by using science and technology, e.g.
by using science to put all the good parts of two plants into one plant.
We can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow faster.
Science and technology can also be used to produce some materials, e.g.
steel or iron, which are used in our buildings.
They can make them stronger and hard to destroy.
Science and technology can give us a lot of good things for our daily life, making it easy for us to do things or work.
I am writing to you about the show.
I was very disappointed after the show.
I would like to have my money back.
First the show started at 10.15, and it should have started at 19.30.
After your show I wanted to visit my friends, and because of it, I couldn't do that.
Also, you wrote about discounts, but it was not true! The woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me, actually she started swearing at me.
During the show, I was very hungry but I hoped to visit the restaurant, which was a pity, because the restaurant was closed because it was too late.
And, I forget to say something about the actors, I didn't enjoy them.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but I trusted him anyway.
It happened 3 months ago, and during the last few months I have been very upset.
I have a friend, his name is Peter, he is my best friend.
Two days later, in the morning, a policeman came to see Peter...
So, now my best friend is a prisoner.
All the time, I am thinking about Peter.
I don't forget him.
He will be in prison for 5 years.
By the way, I haven't seen Pat for about one year.
Perhaps, he moved to another town.
It's good that he is far away...
I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison.
But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny...
I went to see the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' in the Circle Theatre.
I was really disappointed because a lot of things were not done.
I will explain these now and want to ask to get back some of the money I have paid you.
It was said that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were starring in the show.
Danny Brook was not there, a different actor was in his place.
That was very disappointing for me.
When I went to buy tickets, they didn't give discounts.
But I had read that discounts were available.
As again, we went to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed.
They said that it was late and they wanted to go home.
There was nothing for us to do, the show started 45 minutes late.
Now, I think that you have seen, it was not a perfect evening at all, a lot of the things advertised were not done, so I am asking to get some of my money back.
My daily life: I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do.
I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost on the Internet etc.
TV was black and white at first and there were only two or three channels.
Now it's colour and there are many channels on TV.
You watch whichever you want.
I don't think that I watch the same channels every day.
A wonderful example of modern technology: the computer! It is not a living thing but it has a brain.
It knows more than most  people.
I'm writing to you to make a complaint about the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre.
Firstly, I found that there were no discounts as were published in the advertisement.
Then, I not only had to wait 45 minutes more than expected for the beginning of the show but I realised that the main actor had been replaced by another (very bad) one as well.
Of course I must tell you that the main reason for my going to see the show was Danny Brook's presence.
Finally, after the show, I went to the theatre restaurant only to find that it was closed and the friend I had asked to meet me there was not waiting for me.
As if that was not enough, he thought I had been kidding, inviting him to a closed restaurant where I didn't show up.
Those are the reasons for my asking for a refund of the £20 I paid.
Every day we discover new devices that promise to satisfy our needs.
I usually don't buy a lot of them but I must admit that some of them are useful.
I can't remember waking up without the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee.
Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one thing I consider to be the most important influence technology has had on my life: the computer and Internet.
The advance of electronics and global communications has made it possible to know places, look for information or even keep in close contact with friends all over the world.
Now, I will never again say that I don't know where I can find some information about this or that and when on holiday or every time I make a new friend, I just ask for an e-mail address and that's enough to know we will know about each other soon.
First of all, it was supposed to be starring Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but in the real show, it wasn't.
Because I'm big fan of them, it was pretty boring without them and not to mention that it was disappointing.
The tickets also caused a problem.
Discounts weren't available at all.
Moreover, the restaurant was still under construction so that we couldn't use it when we were extremely hungry.
Technology has been developing extremely fast these days and as it is still going on, it can't help affecting our lives.
One of the biggest things that have changed is the change in the methods of communication.
People have invented such things as TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us able to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily.
There are also changes in biological areas.
except a few like AIDS.
It helped us to live longer and make us stronger against them.
I have mentioned a few changes above but there's still the biggest one left, which is related to the field of computers.
It helped us to be able to work much more quickly and accurately than before with the help of the Internet.
Basically, modern technology has made our life more comfortable but there are some disadvantages such as lack of friendship, togetherness because of people staying in their house being on the Internet for the whole day.
But we still have to admit that we can't live without them even though they give us some disadvantages.
I refer to your advertisement in the Herald Tribune where you advertised the Circle Theatre and the recent musical: Over the Rainbow.
On Saturday, June 5th, 2000 my wife and I wanted to have a nice and enjoyable evening and decided to go and see the musical.
When we arrived at the theatre we realised that there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones.
After that one of the theatre assistants told us that the show would begin at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as advertised.
So we had to rest for a while and had a drink.
To make matters worse Danny Brook, who was advertised as one of the starring actors in the musical, was not acting this evening.
You can imagine how disappointed we were, especially as the Danny Brook's acting was the main reason we went to see the musical.
On top of this we intended to go to the theatre restaurant, which was closed because of building activities.
As you can imagine we were very disappointed and it wasn't a perfect evening out.
I would like to have 50% of the price of the tickets back.
I am looking forward to your prompt reply.
Fashion will always be an interesting and important subject for all ages.
Today the fashion industry has a great importance in the commercial market.
In the next 100 years there will be no change in that but fashion is going to develop in a special imaginative way.
Firstly, the material of which clothes are made is of a wide variety.
There are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials, which the production cost.
In 100 years most clothes will be made from synthetic material.
Beyond that colours will play an important role in the next century for fashion.
Light and bright colours will be very common.
The contrast will be especially attractive.
Furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individual but there will still be numerous clothes for conservative people.
On balance fashion in 100 years time will be comfortable and colourful.
The fashion industry will deliver a wide variety of styles, materials and colours.
There will be clothes for everyone's taste.
I read your advertisement for the show and I went to the theatre to see it but I had a very disappointing evening.
In your advertisement, it said that one of the actors was Danny Brook but it was a different actor.
This was very disappointing and I believe that all the people there were angry.
The musical show should have started at half past seven but it started at quarter past eight.
About the tickets, the advertisement said that discounts would be available but they were not.
Also the theatre restaurant was closed and I do not know why.
When I read the advertisement, it said that the restaurant would be open.
Lastly, I want to tell you that I did not have a perfect evening and I would be grateful if you would send me my money back.
I am looking forward to your reply.
Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
Pat was my best friend.
She lived next door and we went to the same school.
I told her all my problems and I could rely on her.
One day I heard my mother tell my father that she wanted to divorce because she couldn't live with him any more.
When I heard this, I went to my room and I was crying.
I called Pat to come to my house because I was not very and to tell her what had happened.
A few minutes later Pat came to my house and I told her that my parents were going to divorce.
Pat did not believe me and she asked why.
I told her that I did not know.
She helped me to forget it for a few minutes, she made me laugh and then she left.
But before she left, I begged her not to tell anybody.
The next morning I went to school and all the students came up to me and told me not to be upset because of my parents.
Then I realised that Pat told them my secret and I felt very angry, that's why I said at the beginning that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
I'm writing to you to complain about my disappointing experience at your theatre last Saturday night.
What I thought was going to be a wonderful night became the worst night at the theatre I've ever had.
Firstly, I must admit that when we realised the main actor had been changed we felt really disappointed.
This is because I had been waiting to enjoy Danny Brook's performance since I saw him the first time on television.
Secondly, despite your advertising the possibility of discounts, when I showed my student identity card to one of your employees she angrily told me that I had to pay the full price.
Moreover, not only had the actor been changed but also the show started forty-five minutes late.
In my opinion you ought to be more serious because of the responsibility you have to entertain the people who come to your theatre.
Finally, at the end of the night we felt a bit hungry but we couldn't eat until we got back home due to your restaurant's new cook being ill.
The truth is the night wasn't my perfect night out as you had advertised so I would appreciate it if you could give me my money back.
I wait to receive a prompt answer from you.
I had always thought that I could rely on her whatever my problem was.
Yet, one extremely hot day while I was peacefully walking by the sea and thinking about my own problems, I discovered my elder brother's girlfriend with another boy.
At first I felt really annoyed and disappointed so I ran to my brother in order to tell him what I had seen.
Nevertheless, when I found him studying hard for his final exams I realised I would rather his girlfriend told my poor brother the truth.
But the thing is I needed to speak to someone about this event so I could feel more relaxed.
I didn't know who to tell  but eventually I decided that if I needed to tell someone a secret I could trust my best friend Pat.
So, the next day, I nervously came to Pat's apartment where she had been living on her own since she was eighteen.
After that, she felt very sad because of the love she had been feeling for my brother for several years and she swore to me that she was going to tell nobody about it.
However, the truth was that no sooner had I arrived home than my brother asked me, crying, why I had told Pat about his girlfriend's affair instead of revealing the truth to him.
Last week I went to London for a holiday.
During my stay in that beautiful city, I thought it was a good idea to go to the theatre to enjoy a Musical , so I decided to go to your theatre to see "over the Rainbow".
It was a very disappointing evening not just for me but for most of the people who were in the theatre.
First of all, I was looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook, and it was very disappointing for me to see a different actor instead of him in spite of his name being written in the advertisement.
In the advertisement for the show I also read that it was going to begin at half past seven p.m.
but, actually, it began at eight fifteen.
I also found out that no discounts were available.
In spite of it being said in the advertisement .
Another disappointing thing I found was that the restaurant was closed because the cook had had an accident with hot water when he was boiling some vegetables.
In the advertisement there's no mention of getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give some back to me.
Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village on the southern coast of Spain with my friend Pat.
We usually went to the beach to have a swim and to enjoy the fantastic weather in that part of Spain during the summer.
One day we found a beautiful little beach next to the big one where some people were sunbathing and some children were playing football in the sand.
As it was so beautiful, we decided to go back to the beach at night to see the moon, the sea and the stars.
When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two people doing something we couldn't see very well.
In order to see it, we got closer to them and, in the end, we saw that they had stolen a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place.
As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell anybody about it.
It was our secret.
Unfortunately Pat told the story to a friend of ours and, I don't know how, but the robbers knew that we had seen all they had been doing.
So, now we are in danger because of that.
I'm writing this letter to inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I visited the Circle Theatre.
Firstly, in the advertisement you said that the actor would be Danny Brook but there was a different actor in the show and I was really disappointed because I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, whom I personally admire.
Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were told but it started after a delay of 45 minutes.
Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed for renovation.
In conclusion, technology has made my life easier but it's also an intrusion in my life, creating a distance between myself and my family.
In my opinion technology is the thing I could use in my life.
I am a foreign student who is on holiday here.
I am going to stay here for a week.
I went to your theatre three days ago and it was horrible.
I'm sorry but I am very disappointed with the show.
I would like to describe to you my experience because I want you to give me my money back.
Last Monday, I went to the theatre with two friends.
We arrived on time but the show was delayed until half-past eight.
Moreover, we weren't given any discount for being students.
Furthermore, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us.
When there was an intermission we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late.
We couldn't have a drink.
Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give me my money back because in the advertisement there were some things that we didn't have in the theatre.
Finally, I would be grateful if you could answer me soon.
Our lives are changing.
When I was a child I had different to those that modern-day children have.
We could play with our toys, dolls and we could enjoy ourselves without a computer.
We hadn't so many machines as they have.
If you have a computer you will be able to have all the information that you want.
It's very important but sometimes it is a bad thing because the children can see it too.
Moreover you can change the TV programme without getting up.
We can find information about the weather and sports on our TV-text.
On the other hand, science is changing.
We have more researchers than a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution to lots of problems.
Actually, we can cure illnesses which were once very dangerous.
I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured.
I was one of your customers who had a very disappointing Over the Rainbow at your Circle Theatre yesterday.
First of all, the stars of the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
The only reason I bought a ticket was because of Danny Brook and Tina Trulove, .
But your stars were not there.
I bought a ticket for the 19.30 performance and the show was very very late.
It started at 20:15 and that wasted my time and made me feel bad about your .
And also the ticket discounts were not available.
.
And finally, your restaurant was not open after the show.
 was totally different from what your advertisement said.
And because of this, I would like to ask for my money back.
If you , please telephone me.
My telephone number is 123-4567.
These days we are living in a high-technology world.
Modern technology has been advancing rapidly and it has affected me a lot.
Indeed, I have to save more money to upgrade my personal computer.
Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumers like you and me definitely have to spend our money to keep our personal computer up to date and capable of working with the new computer software that requires more and more .
Anyway, modern technology such as the Internet changes my lifestyle a great deal.
Using the internet, I can find almost all the information I want to have.
And I can send e-mail to my friends via the Internet fast and cheaply compared to the old-style mail-services.
Finally, I think modern technology allows me do my business faster, better and with much more efficiency.
I'm writing to you to complain about the disappointing experience I had with your theatre.
First of all, I arrived at about 19:20 because the advertisement said that performance begins at 19:30, but it wasn't till about 20:15 that the show began and I had to wait an entire hour, which was not very amusing.
Secondly, I was supposed to get a discount but there were no discounts, although the advertisement said there are.
And last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny Brook would be there, my favourite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
So, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all that the advertisement promised.
As things went that way, I want my money back.
I shall have a look at the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.
How much effort and time it took about two decades ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own.
Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door! The modern cooker will turn itself off if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.
During my last holiday in London, I visited your theatre in order to see "Over the rainbow".
You wrote some things in your advertisement and I was disappointed that they weren't true.
First you have written that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the actual actors were different.
It was a disappointment for me, because these actors were recommended by my friend, because he knows Danny and Tina.
You have also written in your advertisement that it would start at half past seven but it started at 20:15! So we had to wait more than a half hour.
I wouldn't have minded if the restaurant had to eat or drink something, but it was closed, and also it didn't open after the show, because the waitress had to clean the theatre .
Also there were no discount tickets available as you had written there were in your advertisement.
So it wasn't a perfect evening for me and , if I can have my money back.
If it's possible, please write back.
Sincerely ...
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his whole school knew about Sara's experience.
Sara was a very good pupil.
She didn't study a lot but she knew all the important things.
She was a very nice person and she always helped if somebody needed her help.
One day she had to do the shopping for her mother.
She had to buy a lottery ticket and other things for her.
After she had done this she went home, but she didn't buy the ticket because she thought there wasn't any chance of winning.
She spent the money on a magazine.
After she came home her mother was sitting in front of the TV and looked at the lottery numbers.
Suddenly she jumped out of her armchair and shouted: "I have won the jackpot".
Sara was out of breath and after she told her mother she hadn't bought the ticket.
Her mother got angry but some hours later she was friendly again.
Sara couldn't understand the fact that she didn't do the right thing.
She had lost a lot of money, so she would be more careful about doing things .
I went to see Over the rainbow , Friday evening the 16/6.
The musical had been advertised as London's newest and best musical, but .
Modern technology like the Internet, for example, has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways.
The advantage of the Internet is that I can do all my shopping over the Internet.
I don't have to mess around in the supermarket on a Friday evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the groceries I need delivered to my door instead.
I buy all my clothes on the Internet as well and it works brilliantly, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with the Internet too.
I don't get as much exercise as I used to get.
Nowadays I spend 2 hours in front of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people.
I have got friends over the whole world now.
I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my Internet friends.
Modern technology opens new and exciting ways for us.
I don't think that I would be going to Japan if it wasn't for the Internet.
The Internet has opened up a whole new world for me.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I had had my own experience with her already and I would always be careful not to tell her anything important whenever we met.
However, I guess that Olga turned a deaf ear to what I had told her.
That is the impression I got.
I am writing in order to express my disappointment with your musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I saw the show's advertisement hanging up on a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends.
I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good reviews of your Company and, above all, because of the main star, Danny Brook.
The problems started at the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist.
In addition, the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons.
I would like some kind of explanation and to get my money back.
If you don't agree, I will act .
My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially with the funny actor "Danny Brook".
When we saw your advertisement in the "Evening Post" we made a reservation.
Unfortunately, the next evening, one hour before the beginning of the show, we learnt that the actors had been changed at the last minute.
In addition, there was no discount available, and the show started at 20:15 and not at 19:30.
After that, your restaurant was closed without reason.
It would be nice of you if you could refund us some money or send us two new tickets.
I was at the show at your theatre three days ago.
Unfortunately, my expectations were not realized because of the many problems I had during the show.
First of all, there was another actor instead of Danny Brook ().
Secondly, the show was delayed and started at 20.15 so I had to wait 45 minutes, doing absolutely nothing and wasting my time.
No discounts were given and, what is more, your theatre restaurant was closed the whole time.
I was not able to have dinner after the show.
On the whole, I was very disappointed on leaving the Circle Theatre.
.
I ask you to return my money .
Or I will have no option except to go to court.
Three hundred years ago fashion changed once every hundred years.
One hundred years ago it was once in 50-25 years.
And now we have to change some of our clothes every 6 months because they are not so fashionable any more.
Fashion is one of the most important parts of our image and everyday life now.
Fashion is becoming more useful.
All the new inventions and technology are going to play an important part in the fashion industry of the future.
It is very difficult to predict but let us try to imagine what clothes will be like 100 years from now.
With no doubt, the influence of modern technology will be great.
Future clothes will be very useful and incredibly comfortable.
We can see the progress in fashion even now.
It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year 2050.
So the whole fashion industry will work to make clothes more useful, practical and comfortable.
What will we have? Breathing jackets and shirts with air conditioning.
I am writing to explain some problems your theatre has got and to ask for some money back.
I saw your advertisement and I expected a discounted ticket for students.
But in the ticket office I realised I couldn't get it.
Another problem was the time.
The play was supposed to start at 19.30 but it was delayed, so at 20.15 the curtain of the stage was raised.
As soon as the play had started I noticed another problem.
I am a big fan of Danny Book and that was why I chose 'over the rainbow'.
When I saw a different actor playing his role I was really disappointed.
The last problem I would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed for decoration.
When I booked the ticket I really looked forward to the show.
Unlike my expectation it was so disappointing and annoying.
So I would like to ask for some money back.
I remember some I watched on television when I was younger.
They described the future world where people would travel to the moon.
But it is coming true now.
Modern technology has been changing even my daily life in positive and negative ways at the same time.
First it helps to make my social life convenient.
I have got my own computer so it is easy for me to send e-mails to my friends very often.
Second, I can save time.
If there was no public transport like the underground in a big city I couldn't imagine travelling on time.
On the other hand, modern technology could affect my life in a bad way.
Because of computers or telephones I could have less opportunities to meet my friends than before.
It could make my emotions fade.
Another problem is pollution.
I think the car is one of the most common products of modern technology.
The more cars there are on the street, the more difficult it is for me to keep myself fit.
To sum it up, as technology is improving my life itself is becoming convenient.
In spite of its good sides, I think my life could get worse.
To live in this world needs somebody else to contact and health.
But I am loosing chances to meet my friend face to face and I feel I am getting weaker.
I suppose people, including me, should It will be caused by technology.
Circle theatre's Manager: I am writing to you because I felt disappointed after seeing the musical "Over the Rainbow".
There were many things that were wrong in the advertisement I saw.
First the actors who were supposed to star in this show were not the ones put on stage.
So when I saw the show I felt horrible, because I was expecting to see Danny Brook.
But the problems started when I arrived at the place.
I had a discount ticket, but they refused it and I had to pay the full price.
Apart from this, the show started forty-five minutes late.
I think these reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
So I hope that you will understand my point.
Please be understanding and realize that your show was not cheap.
I'm a student, so I do not have a lot of money and I need it back.
I also have to tell you that the theatre restaurant was closed because there were too few people there and they the place, so I was very upset.
I will come to your office this week.
I hope to see you there.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known.
She had told him about her relationship with her boyfriend.
Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John loved each other so much that it wouldn't be surprising to find that they had had sex .
The point here is that Caroline chose the worst friend to tell this to.
She was also concerned about being pregnant, but she was afraid to tell John about it.
So she decided to ask Pat what to do.
When she finally told him, Pat reacted in a very bad way and told John immediately.
He couldn't believe what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose.
Pat's father had to pay for a very expensive operation.
But like every story this has a happy ending.
John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her imagination.
And Pat understood that .
Two months ago I went to see your musical show.
I got very angry because you are liars.
It was one of the most disappointing evenings of my life.
The advertisement said that the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but the actors were different.
Who would believe it? You really are a funny theatre.
And then there's the time, too.
You wrote that at 19.30 the musical would start.
I was waiting for 45 minutes: the show started at 20:15.
I paid £20 without any discount.
You said that some discounts were available.
Nobody got a discount.
First of all, the computer.
It helps me when I study.
I can find many things on the Internet or write my compositions on it.
Most of the machines which I have at home help me, too.
I can find cold water in the refrigerator but 50 years ago they didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
When I stay home I can watch TV or listen to the radio etc, so modern technology helps me to spend my free time.
As you have seen, modern technology has changed my daily life a lot and I believe that it has changed it for the better.
I went to the Circle Theatre to see the show "OVER THE RAINBOW" a few days ago.
I am writing this letter to tell you how disappointed I felt with it.
There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show.
In the advertisement, you mentioned Mr.
Danny Brook and Ms.
Tina Truelove were going to perform but actually different people were performing, whom I had never seen before.
And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15.
To make it worse, neither discounts nor restaurants were available that night although they were said to be available.
According to the owner of the restaurant, it was closed because .
, it was not a perfect evening at all but horrible, so I would like to ask for my money back and compensation for my special 20th birthday.
I am waiting to receive your reply as soon as possible.
There are already a variety of fashion styles nowadays.
Some are formal others are casual.
Especially in big cities such as London, New York and Tokyo, you can see a lot of people in various clothes, so I do not think there will be such big differences in the appearance of clothes even 100 years from now.
However, I think there will be some differences in the quality and materials of clothes.
For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made, especially with swimming costumes and athletes' for the Olympics.
In addition, I think the earth will be warmer and than now and 100 years from now .
So clothes for space will be necessary and clothes for warmer climates will be necessary.
In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think a better quality of clothes will be in every .
Although the appearance such as shape and colour will not change so much in fashion.
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow", which I went to see last week.
First of all, the actors that played in the show were different to Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Besides this they were not good actors, so I am quite disappointed.
Then, the show was meant to start at half past seven and I had to wait forty-five minutes because it started late.
But that is not all because in the advertisement it appeared that discounts were available and that is false; I had to pay £20 for each ticket.
Finally, I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant and have a good dinner after the show but it was impossible.
The restaurant was closed because most of the employees were on holiday and there were not enough people to meet the demand.
In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund on the tickets.
I will be looking forward to hearing from you.
Alice is my best friend and we met twenty years ago.
We went to the same school and we had the same hobbies.
It was perfect because we were always together and doing interesting activities like snowboarding.
One day her mother died and she had to move to Germany where her sister was living.
But she was very sad because she knew that it would be very difficult for us to see each other in the future.
After that, we wrote letters and she phoned me once a week but it wasn't the same.
I couldn't explain all my problems to her and her voice had changed.
Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted it to be a surprise.
I worked hard for one month so I could save the money to buy a plane ticket.
I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she wouldn't say anything but it wasn't true.
Yesterday she phoned Alice and explained everything.
In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities for us to do together so we have the best week of our lives.
I am writing this letter to complain about the treatment that we received when we went to the Circle theatre in order to see the musical show "Over the rainbow", whose actors were Anthony Keens and Tina Truelove.
When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we waited for a long time, because your advertisement stated that the show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15.
Moreover, the actors were not the same as the ones in the advertisement.
Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on holiday.
This evening was the worst evening of my life.
I would like you to give me back some money for the tickets.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil.
Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil posthaste.
Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea on the outskirts of the city.
It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen.
Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a beautiful garden.
When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased.
We had to come back to Spain.
Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs.
When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain to our parents all about our adventure.
That day was the worst day of my whole life.
Now, Sally and I are married, have three children, a marvellous house and both of us are working for a big company.
I address this letter to you because as the manager of "The Circle Theatre" I hold you responsible for the most disappointing evening in a theatre I have had in years.
I went to see the evening performance of your production of "Over the Rainbow" on Saturday the 2nd of June.
At first I was irritated that contrary to your announcements no discounts were available.
I bought one of the most expensive tickets.
To my greatest disappointment Danny Brooks was not in the show, but his part was played by an actor whose (lack of ) singing and acting skills did not make him a suitable replacement.
After the show I found out that the theatre restaurant, which had been recommended to me, was closed because it had been booked by a private party.
Contrary to your advertisement I did not have a "perfect evening out" and I think that you should return to me at least half of the 20 £ I paid for my ticket.
This short story is about a man who is accused of having murdered a rich elderly widow who left her whole fortune to him.
He had befriended her without telling her that he was married.
To help her husband she works out a plan: she is willing to be a witness for the prosecution and states that her husband was not with her at the time the crime was committed.
She then gives letters to her husband's lawyer that seem to prove that she has been unfaithful to him and that she tried to get rid of him with the help of false accusations.
The plan works: the jury thinks that the wife is a notorious liar and her husband is found innocent.
After the trial the lawyer is told that the man was indeed guilty.
I am writing to tell you that I was very disappointed with the theatre.
One of my reasons for travelling to London was this theatre.
I thought that "Over the rainbow" was horrible! I thought that it was the best musical show that London had.
I was wrong, very wrong.
In the advertisement it was written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove are the actors, and in the theatre you had totally different actors.
I bought my tickets days before the performance thinking I would get a discount.
But the opposite happened.
I paid the same as a who bought the tickets ten minutes before the performance.
Another thing I have to complain about is the time of the performance.
It was supposed to start at half past seven, and it only started at fifteen minutes past eight.
After all this, I want to know if I will get some money back.
I hope so.
It is true that science and technology affects our lives a lot.
Technology is essential to our life, we need it each minute, each second.
It is rare that schools don't have a multimedia centre with many computers for the students to use.
But this is good and bad at the same time.
Good because you can have access to a lot of information, and it is bad because the computers are doing people's work.
Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who has the certain knowledge that computers will not take the place of teachers? It is interesting to start to think about this point.
Another point is that television is taking childhood away from children.
For example, our parents had time to play with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only show silly programmes.
We need this technology, but we have to know how to control it.
I am writing to you to tell you that I saw your musical show "Over the Rainbow" and there were too many disappointing divergences between the advertisement for the show and the show itself.
The main problem was that Danny Brook did not take part in the show.
However, I bought a £20 ticket mostly because I saw his name in the advertisement.
Furthermore, the show started only at 20:15, although it was supposed to start at 19:30.
Moreover your theatre restaurant was closed all evening, and I think you should know that tickets were sold without any discounts.
It seems to me that all these failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organisation of the show.
I think you ought to have postponed the show and reimbursed me for the ticket price.
However, considering that I saw the show, I would like to get a 50% refund.
Please reply at your earliest convenience.
Modern technology has changed my daily life completely.
When I say modern technology, I mean the Internet.
For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend some hours after he has written it.
My friend lives in Kresnodar.
My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar.
And it takes 3 days for her letter to get to Kursk.
That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses the postal service.
So with the Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time.
Another change in my life is that I use the Internet as a library when I write my course papers so that I can get books which it is impossible to get in the libraries of my town.
That is why I think that modern technology helps me in my daily life.
I'm writing to you because I wanted to tell you what a bad experience I had during my holidays when I went to see the play on at your theatre.
To begin with, the actor you published as going to perform, didn't.
To make things even worse, the play didn't start at 19:30 as it was supposed to but instead it started 45 minutes late, at 20:15, and there weren't even your famous discounts available.
As if that wasn't enough, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and it is not very hard to guess that I wasn't able to enjoy it, as it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to serve food; the perfect ending to the perfect evening.
Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go and spend the money on a good play where they do what they've promised.
Modern technology is, nowadays, not only a "tool" for everyday life but also a lifestyle.
People are getting more and more addicted to this, because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable.
In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without.
By a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio, or a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before.
For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything.
Another thing I depend on is the computer.
Not only to play games or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school.
I think that anything that can make our lives better should be done, because that way we won't have so many things to be concerned about, and we will be able to live a happier and more relaxed life.
I've recently been to one of your musical shows called "Over the rainbow" at the Circle theatre in London, thinking it might be a good idea but it was disappointing.
I'm writing this letter to explain to you what happened and to look for a solution.
Secondly, there was some false information in your advertisement that made me angry.
You said it would be Danny brook who would sing but it wasn't.
And , there weren't any discounts on the prices of the tickets.
For all these reasons, I want my money back, at least 15 of the 20 pounds I paid.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so I knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, Oasis.
And she had planned with my friends to go without me.
At first I got more angry with Pat than with my other friends in the group, because Pat was and is my best friend.
However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked her why.
She answered , "Because all this year you have been so irritable that you got angry with everybody who tried to talk to you," and the other friends had convinced her to dump me.
Then I realised that she had reason.
I was irritable because my parents were going to get divorced, but Pat would always be my best friend so I told her that I wasn't angry with her and I was not going to go to the concert because I had to go to the court to solve my parent's affair.
I asked her to take photos of Oasis for me and she agreed to.
If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry about not being able to go.
And that's the story of how I missed the opportunity to go to the only concert that Oasis have given in my city.
My name is ***.
Recently I spent a week's holiday in London.
I read the advertisement and I found it interesting so I thought that it would be nice to spend one of the nights I had in London at your musical show.
But I was completely wrong.
It was an awful experience.
I went with two friends on the 21st of August, and one of the reasons was that we are big fans of Danny Brook and we were looking forward to seeing his show.
You can imagine how disappointing it was to find out that he was replaced by another actor who is not so popular.
We were there at 19:15, as the show was starting at 19:30, to get our tickets.
We asked for the discounts you mentioned in your advertisement but at the counter they told us that they were not available because it was Sunday.
That was terrible but we didn't want to make a fuss so we went inside and waited.
The show started forty-five minutes later.
We got really bored waiting.
After the show finished we went for dinner at the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the owner was ill.
She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family.
She went to a new school and she had no friends.
She was not very sociable and she could not establish relationships very easily.
In time she became close friends with Kim, who was really strange to the other students.
Everybody disliked her.
Pat was wondering why and one day she found out.
Kim explained to her that she kept her distance from the other students because her father was in prison and she didn't want anyone to find out.
Pat kept this a secret for two months but one day revealed it by accident to a boy in her class.
In a few days all the school knew Kim's story.
Kim was because everyone was making fun of her and she was very angry with Pat.
Pat had to make it up to Kim.
She had to find a way to make Kim forgive her.
She found the perfect way.
She stood up in front of the whole class and explained that Kim's father's actions didn't Kim, that she was a great friend to her and if someone deserved to be punished, it was her.
Kim forgave her and all the students understood how wrong they had been and were very sorry.
They could all get to know the real Kim now.
I am writing to complain about the musical show, Over the Rainbow, which you advertised.
I saw the show at your theatre with my friend on 6th June.
However, I was disappointed with .
First of all, I would like to have seen Danny Brook as I am keen on his acting.
He did not perform that evening.
It made me sad.
Secondly, the starting time has been changed from 19:30 to 20:15.
We waited for ages because we had not been informed.
In addition, although you advertised that discount tickets were available, they do not sell them any more according to your staff.
Finally, we went to the restaurant in your theatre after the show.
It was closed because of the staff training.
I am sure you can understand my disappointment.
I must insist that you refund the cost of the show.
Unless I hear from you within ten days, I shall have to take legal advice on this matter.
It is believed that our lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc, especially for families.
I have found it very expensive to buy them but there are a number of advantages.
First of all, dishwashers are very convenient for me because I work full-time and look after my children.
It is very difficult to cook and wash dishes after working.
Before buying my dishwasher I asked my son to wash them.
He complained about that a lot.
Secondly, computers are useful for us as well, because we do not need to go somewhere if we want to get information, for example about travelling.
However, my family members do communicate with each other less than they used to, because my children are keen on playing computer games.
In my opinion, modern technology makes our life easier.
It is very good for us but I think we should think more carefully when we buy something for our children.
I am writing to you to describe some problems I had when I went to the theatre to see one of your company's musical shows called "Over the rainbow".
I would like to say that the information given in your advertisement was not true at all.
First of all, the main actors were meant to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
I was very disappointed when I discovered Danny Brook was not going to play and a different actor would play it instead of him.
You should review the advertisements you do because you give inaccurate information.
For example, the advertisement said we could buy tickets at a discount, but when I went to buy one your employees told me there were no discounts available.
When the show was over I went to have dinner in your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacking employees.
In conclusion, what I expected to be "my perfect evening", as you said in your advertisement, was a very disappointing evening due to the problems I had.
I would like to know if I could have some money back for these problems I have told you about.
I advise you to pay more attention to your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
It all began when, three days ago, I was doing some homework in my classroom.
I was alone because Pat had to go to the cinema with her parents.
Suddenly, I heard footsteps that were getting closer to me.
It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there.
After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher left the classroom.
I was bored, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going.
He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket.
"See you tomorrow!" I cried, but he didn't listen to me.
Then, while I was going back to my classroom I saw he hadn't switched off the light in his room.
I went to switch it off.
As soon as I entered that room I realised he had left our exams there.
I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do the next day were there.
Without thinking twice, I took one of them and quickly went home.
I had to phone Pat to tell her which questions were in the exam.
When I told her the news, she was surprised.
We thought we shouldn't tell anybody else.
Next day, in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams.
But my plan didn't work well.
Next day, everybody knew about my great find because Pat hadn't kept our secret.
The problem was that my teacher also knew about it because someone had told him "the story of the exam papers", as he called my big problem.
He told me I had done wrong taking the exam paper but I think the only thing I did wrong was telling Pat my important secret.
Next time I will make sure I can trust who I'm telling my secret to.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show which the Circle Theatre is staging.
I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay I went to your theatre to see "Over the Rainbow".
My evening was very disappointing.
The play should have started at 19.30 but it started forty-five minutes later, we were waiting there without anything to do.
We got very bored and tired.
After the show had finished, I went to the theatre restaurant to have something to drink and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday.
Moreover the discounts were not available as you said in the advertisement and I paid £20.
Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
He and his friends got into trouble because of this habit last week.
As they were watching TV at Nick's house last Sunday, Sally noticed that their cat Curly was hurt, and she could not walk.
The children were very unhappy and felt sorry for the pet.
"Somebody hurt her and left her without help", Mourk said angrily.
"We have to find him and make him pay for his action", Sally told them.
Everybody agreed with her.
Suddenly Pat cried: "Oh my Lord, Bad Jon did this.
Yesterday, as I was arriving home, I saw him in your yard, Mack.
He looked very satisfied, Curly was lying on the grass and..." "Yes, oh Lord he did it because we beat his team at football", Nick said.
"He is so bad.
We will make him pay.
Hey, listen guys, we will take his dog which he loves very much and we will sell it to Sally who wants one.
We will pay Curly's vet with the money that we get", Pat said.
Next morning, as Pat was going to school, he met Bad Jon and said to him, "Hey, you.
We know what you have done and your dog will be sold".
Bad Jon understood and talked immediately to his father who was the school about the children's plan.
Of course they were punished.
In the advertisement the time when the show should start was 19.30 but it started at 20:15.
When I arrived at the theatre and asked for the discount, it wasn't available.
In your advertisement the show was starring Danny Brook, and on the stage a different actor performed and his acting was very poor.
The whole show and the acting was of a standard comparable to school theatre.
When we decided to visit the theatre Restaurant after the show it was closed because some decorating wasn't finished.
It was this last point that got me angry.
After everything that had happened we went to the hotel .
It wasn't the perfect evening out, as you promised in your a advertisement, and I want to ask for my money back.
In the last one hundred years science and technology has taken a big step, if we look back.
Similarly, more than 100 years ago people didn't have the light bulb.
They just used a candle.
Nobody thought about the Telephone, and telegraph.
From a small village to the town was a very long way because people used a horse and wagon.
And look at us now.
Every family now has a TV, to travel long distances we use not just the car but also the train and aeroplane.
Before we had a fantasy about how people might travel to other planets, and what we see now is a spaceship cruising in space.
We spend the most of our lives operating computers.
Before it was only in our imaginations.
New technology has made our lives more comfortable and easier.
Everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the house, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can think much faster than a human.
And I can continue my list in this way...
because science never stops in one place.
I would like to complain about the show which you presented last Saturday.
It was such a disappointing evening out with my friend during our week's holiday in London.
We have had a quite pleasant time except for that evening.
Actually it spoiled our time.
So I would like to get back our money.
These are some points I want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
First, I had a great expectation to see Danny Brook playing his role, but he had never shown up that night.
The main actor was an unknown actor.
It was such a disappointment.
Second, it only started at 20:15.
It was 45 minutes later than it was supposed to be.
It was so boring to wait for the show in a noisy and hot theatre.
Third, there was no possibility of a discount.
The girl who sold the tickets was laughing at me when I mentioned about how the discounts availability was written in the advertisement.
Finally, the sentence that was written on the advertisement was absolutely not true.
It was the most imperfect evening out I ever experienced.
I hope that you can provide a better service next time, and this time you need to give back the money we paid.
Since I moved to London to study English I have had a hard time making intimate friendships with people around me.
First it was because of the culture difference.
It took quite a long time to adjust to the in the language institute.
Secondly the language ability was another issue.
Even if I could meet some friend, I couldn't express my to them because we have different backgrounds and our first languages were different.
I really wished to have a friend with whom I could share everything that is going on in our lives.
Finally I met Pat.
She was such a wonderful person in our class.
She tried to help others when they had a difficult time at school.
One day she realized that I was always outside of the circle.
One day she invited me to her flat.
Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually.
We had a fantastic time together for three months.
We could even make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books.
I thought that I had found a good friend in my life.
So I told her everything about my life.
There were some stories I never told anyone before, but I shared with her all my secrets.
Peter had a terrible problem with drugs.
He started to consume the stuff at the age of twenty.
He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down in Australia, but Peter was used to living in New York, where it is overcrowded and he was surrounded by people.
Australia is too calm a country for him.
We invited him to the Texas concert but he started to talk nonsense because of the drugs.
Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert.
A security guard saw this and turned his attention to him.
Pat stared at him and asked for help.
The security guard heard her and agreed with Pat that if Peter continued acting in this way he would advise us to leave the concert.
He did .
When we arrived home, Pat told his mother what had happened.
I'm writing to complain about the musical show 'Over the Rainbow.' I saw it yesterday evening in your 'Circle Theatre'.
By the way, I would like to enquire about getting some money back.
I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by seeing it.
I believed in the phrase with which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect.
The show should have started at half past 7 pm but nothing happened.
I waited and it became 8 o'clock pm - nothing happened.
At quarter past 8 pm the show started and I was looking for Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
But I saw some foreign actors I didn't know.
I was very it and I remembered that this was the third problem that evening.
When arriving at the theatre there were no discounts available.
Now I asked myself if there would be another problem.
The problem came.
The restaurant, which I decided to visit after the show to eat something, was closed without any explanation and the perfect evening was completely imperfect.
I think these are reasons enough to enquire about getting some money back.
I would be glad to get an answer from you.
Fashion changes every year.
Do you remember what people wore 100 years ago? And by the way, do you believe that they also thought the fashion never changed? But fashion changes.
100 years ago people wore long and big skirts.
You can say they wore a lot of clothes at one time.
Nowadays people wear fewer clothes.
Often you wear very little but short skirts and tops.
Often you show your skin because it's popular to do that and everyone does it.
So it will be possible to wear nothing in the future.
A lot of things will be easier to do.
But in the winter there's still a problem  to solve.
In the winter you'll freeze.
But this problem is solving itself.
The summers and winters get warmer.
The reason for this is global warming, which is the solution for the problem and another reason why this idea is possible.
But in some situations you have to wear something.
The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special method of production.
So don't laugh at this idea.
Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it.
It's possible.
On 14th June 2000 I went to see your "Over The Rainbow" musical show and there are a few matters which I would like to bring to your attention.
Your advertisement featured "Danny Brook and Tina Truelove" as the main characters but in fact some other people replaced them that evening.
The time mentioned on the tickets was 19:30, however, the show started at 20:15.
I was very disappointed with my supposed "perfect evening out" at your theatre and for all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets.
"Technology" is an appealing as well as an interesting word for me.
From ancient times up to now science has allowed the world and human beings to develop positively and negatively.
Egyptians, Mayas, Incas, etc.
had civilisations with great knowledge because they had mastered most of the fields of science we deal with today.
Back in the 30s the different governments invented guns, battleships and all kinds of weapons for their armies.
Military technology has affected our lives more than we think because most of the equipment we use was originally created by those people.
 The growing computer industry is leaving us less and less physical work .
Biotechnology is providing us with the latest discoveries to heal or improve the human body to maintain it at its most efficient state.
Means of transport are also part of the overall technological advancement and allow us to go faster and further than before with less effort.
Besides all those improvements and comforts I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us.
I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives, however, I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or have already fallen into wicked hands.
I am writing this letter in order to complain about my unpleasant experience at your theatre.
Two days ago, I went to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow" at your theatre.
The advertised starting time is 19:30 but for some unknown reason, the play didn't start until 20:15.
The audience were anxious and bored.
What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all.
An understudy took his place.
We felt totally disappointed and cheated.
After the show, I was hungry and tired.
As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant.
But when I got there, it had closed.
In addition, the ticket office didn't offer me any discounts, as you had advertised on the poster, when I bought the ticket.
I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy the evening at your theatre at all.
I hope you can pay me the money back as compensation.
I am waiting for your reply.
Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways.
First with a lot of advanced techniques being put to practical use, our living conditions are becoming more and more convenient and comfortable.
When we look around the house, it is easy to find things like a microwave oven, TV set, computer etc.
All these items of equipment are applications of modern science.
When you are planning to travel, you can choose a train, car or even a plane as your means of transportation.
Without the development of modern technology, it may take you several years to reach your destination.
Second, modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable.
With the spreading use of the Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other via the web.
And we can also share important information with other people.
The development of information technology has changed the world into "a global village".
Modern technology plays an important role in our lives.
I am hoping to devote myself to its development.
I am writing to you because I was very disappointed with the show you have put on to attract people to come to your theatre.
First of all, I came to see the play just because my favourite actress should have been in it, but she wasn't.
The time of the evening performance on the ticket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15, which forced visitors to stay in one place for 45 minutes, a waste of time.
The ticket discounts were not available under any circumstances and the theatre restaurant was closed.
I strongly recommend you to pay a minimum 50% of the full price that I paid.
I think that in 100 years from now, the clothes fashion will be totally different.
In my opinion the world itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming, also people will become nicer, less this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with colours like dark green or grey.
They will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable.
Also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and Green peace will be very strong , much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
So we can imagine the Future Fashion might be pleasant or unpleasant for different people.
The styles will be more or less the same as each other and everyone will be satisfied with them .
I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show I saw during my stay in London.
This show was supposed to be a perfect event but actually I had a very disappointing evening.
I also would like to know why the show started at a quarter past eight instead of half past seven.
I spent a lot of time waiting for the show to start.
I really do understand that problems can always come up but it would not have been a problem for me if I had been informed about it.
So, what should have been a nice evening out became a nightmare.
Firstly I would like to talk about computers.
A couple of years ago I bought a new computer and I had to learn all about them.
Even though it was my first one I managed and I got to know the way they work pretty fast.
Now, I'm just fascinated by the Internet and I spend at least half an hour every day surfing the net, visiting lots of websites and getting all kinds of information for free.
I should not forget mobile phones.
If I feel like talking to a friend I just have to call him and wherever he is I will be able to get through to him.
Several European companies like Nokia or Ericsson are focusing on mobiles and I have been told that in a couple of years it will be possible to send an e-mail either from a computer or from a mobile, which is going to be great.
Finally I want to say that three weeks ago I started working for a new company and my job is all about new technologies.
I'm extremely happy because not only do I earn a lot of money but also I'm learning a lot.
So, as you can see, modern technology has had an influence on my life.
I am writing to you about your musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW".
I went and saw it at the theatre but I was very disappointed.
I went to see a good show but I did not.
Danny Brook was meant to be the starring actor but he was not, another actor took his place.
That was very disappointing.
The play was meant to start at 19.30 but it was very delayed.
It started at 20.15.
And this is not all, there is more.
In the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not.
Also the restaurant was closed because there was not any food left.
I think the next time you an advertisement you should put in the right information.
I did not have a perfect evening with so many problems, so I am asking you to give me some money back.
Does technology have a bad or a good effect? What does it offer to us? How do people use modern technology? Let's see if we use modern technology, whether we have good or bad results.
In the 18th century, technology started to grow more and more and the 20th century was called the century of technology.
During that time technology made a great step forward.
Technology helps people.
It informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps and helps people do their job.
But modern technology does a lot of bad things.
A lot of countries buy guns, for their defence they say, but they buy them to kill people.
Modern technology is affecting people in a good and bad way.
We have to be very careful with technology.
Technology can't ever stop going forward, and so people always go forward but with the same modern technology.
Technology is in our lives.
During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'.
In the advertisement you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't.
So with this letter I want to ask for some money back.
Now I want to explain about the problems.
It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, as was promised in the advertisement.
It also said that the evening shows started at 19.30, but it started 20.15.
I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available.
After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of illness.
So I want to ask for my money back, also I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisement.
I hope you will answer my letter and solve the problems at your theatre.
First you have to define what is meant by 'modern technology'.
For me modern technology is things like personal computers, mobile phones, keyboards, video recorders, hi-fi sound systems, television or even cars.
But are they useful in every situation and everywhere? My opinion is that modern technology can help you to save time.
In my case for example my car is very time-saving.
If I want to go to training I need not wait for the bus, and so I need not start one and a half hours before training, I start half an hour before.
So I save one hour, which I can use for other hobbies or for homework or something else.
One finds the same with mobile phones, if I have one I needn't go to the public phones, I save time.
If I have got the Internet I can send e-mails, I needn't go to the letter box, I save time.
In my daily life I can save time, but I think everybody should use the the time he has saved for things like hiking, walking, swimming, for a "natural life" and not for a life in a technical world with stress and sorrows because we are humans and not robots.
We should also move our body and not only use our brain.
I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show "over the rainbow".
I was very disappointed because the actors weren't Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Instead of them you had different actors.
Then the show was delayed, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30.
I had to wait 45 minutes! Another thing is that the discounts weren't available although I had read about them earlier in your advert.
After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but when I arrived at the restaurant it had been closed.
But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the restaurant after the show.
I can't understand this kind of mistake.
You also wrote that the evening would be perfect.
For me it wasn't and because of that I ask you to give me my money back.
If you can't give me all the money back then do it partially.
Modern technology has changed my daily life in the sense that everything I do is becoming easier.
For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer.
If I search for something like a telephone number or an address I also look it up on the Internet.
I also use the Internet when I need any information, for example if I need some information for school or privately, for myself.
A few years ago I had to go to a library and look things up in many books.
That took a long time.
I think the advantage of modern technology is that everything I do goes very fast and I have more time for my hobbies or for friends.
Another important point for me is that things like listening to music or watching TV sound better and the pictures on TV are being improved, because the machines become better.
And also a good for me is the mobile, because everywhere I go I can talk to other people.
Last night, I came to your musical show, "Over the rainbow", and I was very disappointed because it wasn't like what you wrote in your advertisement.
For example, your advertisement said that the stars were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but at the show they were not there! There were Kevin Starr and Jessica Richmond.
For me, this a big mistake.
This problem was not the only one because another problem was with respect to the time.
Your advertisement said that the show would start at 19:30 PM, but it started at 20:15 PM.
I don't like to .
The third problem was that it was written that discounts were available, but when I got there it was not true.
The fourth problem was that the theatre restaurant was supposed to be open after the show, but once again it was a lie because the restaurant was closed for renovation.
Finally, I can tell you that I spent the worst evening in all my life at your show and that one more time your advertisement lied to say "You will have a perfect evening!" After all these complaints, I am sure that you will understand why I would like to have my money back and that I was disappointed last night.
So I wish to hear from you soon.
Modern technology, such as computers, cars and other things, have changed my life in many different ways such as communication, travelling and working.
For example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense that I don't need my dad or my mum to go ice-skating or to go to work.
I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology, but because I can show that I am responsible.
With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries than Switzerland.
I am writing in order to complain about the show "Over the Rainbow", which played in the "Circle Theatre", because the information which was given in your advertisement was not true at all.
First of all, I would like to say something about the star: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard of.
So the main purpose of my visit had failed.
Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes late.
A serious theatre can't fail on such an important thing, the time of the performance.
I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough.
Moreover, once I was paying for the tickets, I found another thing out: there were no discounts available.
In your advertisement you informed us of their false existence.
But there is still another point: the theatre restaurant where I had decided to have supper was closed, without anyone giving the reason.
I had to go back to the hotel, because all the restaurants in the area were completely crowded.
Summing up, you might have realised that that wasn't "my perfect evening out" which you promised, so I would like you to give me the money I paid for the ticket back.
This might be the only way I keep on relying on your theatre.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and because of this Pat caused a big, but stupid, problem.
In the end Pat phoned Marie and told her: she was a very good friend.
Marie was so shocked that, as soon as Pat had stopped speaking, she phoned Nick and, without letting him say anything, she broke up their relationship.
But the truth was very different, because what Nick was doing there was something which had nothing to do with what Pat had thought.
Nick was there because the following Sunday would be a very special day for him: he would have been going out with Marie for three years, and he wanted to buy a present for her.
But..what about the girl? She was his cousin! She works as a model, and she was advising him about what clothes, etc,...
to buy for her.
Pat couldn't keep that secret, and in spite of helping Marie, she made a couple break up.
I had a very disappointing evening.
First, Danny Brook didn't appear in "Over the rainbow", his part was played by Danny De Vito.
Also, the play started forty-five minutes later than the time announced.
I can understand that a play can start fifteen minutes late, but not forty-five.
Second, my wife and I paid £20 for the tickets and we asked for discounts.
The receptionist who gave me the tickets told me that no discounts were available that night.
After a boring play, I decided to go to the theatre restaurant, but peculiarly it was closed.
I decided to go home and make some sandwiches.
The principal reason I'm writing to you at the moment is that I want my money back, because I felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play.
It's a good question, because I have never asked myself it.
I think modern technology is changing my daily life so much and also changing the lives of others like me.
Before modern technologies arrived, you couldn't communicate as easily as we can do today.
An example could be the Internet.
It changed my life, because with it I can find more information than I can in a newspaper, and also information from all around the world, which I could never possibly access without the Internet.
But, it is not only news or information.
You can communicate with people in places where you would never imagine going to because it would be too expensive.
An example could be the popular chat rooms, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell.
But, if you don't like using the keyboard to say something or to communicate, you can use video conferencing, a system which lets you talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers.
Also there is the potential to download things to your PC like software, pictures and, also, music.
The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a , I can carry this music everywhere.
Also computers and mobile phones have evolved thanks to modern technologies.
Without this evolution, we would probably still be in ancient times.
Who wants to return to ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TVs, no phones, no PCs..
I'm afraid that the people in ancient times lived although they didn't have any of these things, but me and everyone in these times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like to return to this life.
Also, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that they are expensive, but with time, the price goes down.
So, if the price goes down it is because something new is at available to sell.
It is like a circle.
I am writing to complain about the musical show, which I have seen in The Circle Theatre on 6th June.
On that date, I decided to spend one evening seeing a musical show as I was on holiday in London and was interested in the musical show.
But things started to go wrong from the beginning.
The first problem was the price of tickets.
I expected to buy a ticket cheaply but no discounts were available.
Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late.
I found the theatre rather noisy as I arrived very early to sit in the front row.
Although I got a bit annoyed, I tried to have a good time.
However, something wrong occurred again.
The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brochure, did not play a part in the show.
And I was really disappointed with the different actor's performance.
He kept forgetting his lines.
Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show, but it was closed because it was being refurbished .
I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from the advertisement.
I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund.
I expect to receive a cheque for £20.
I look forward to hearing soon.
Have you ever been to a fashion show named "New trend, New Millennium"? 'It's completely different! How can we go out wearing those clothes?' This is what my friend said the other day when she went to see the show with me.
These days, new designs and new trends are coming out every day, sometimes we are shocked by them in comparison with the days when we were young.
However, it doesn't seem to take long for most young people to get used to it, so we can imagine what clothes will be like in the future.
 I believe that clothes indicate the individual's creativity as well as social situation.
We never know whether we might look like robots because it will be the electronic age.
On the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so they prefer to wear nothing.
I'm writing to you because I want you to give the money back, which I spent on your show - "London's newest and best musical show: Over the rainbow", presented in the Circle Theatre.
In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised in your advertisement, I had a very disappointing evening.
Moreover I had to wait forty-five minutes for the beginning of the show.
And I hate to wait! There were also the discounts which weren't available.
And to finish, the restaurant was closed, for reasons you didn't tell us.
So I couldn't eat that evening.
Hoping you'll comply with my request.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
So the surprise we prepared for Leon's birthday had failed.
However, we'd started to plan for it one month before.
To start with, I wanted to bring him to my house where everybody would wait for him.
But he wanted to stay at home.
So Sigone thought of the greatest idea.
We would pretend to have bought a dog for him.
Leon hates dogs, and I don't know why.
So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognise.
And I found one.
I had a friend who had just got a little dog.
But he was Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon.
No luck.
I am writing this letter to complain about the Circle Theatre.
I went to the theatre last weekend to see "Over the rainbow'.
I read your advertisement.
However, it .
I had a very disappointing evening.
Firstly, Danny Brook did not appear as you had promised.
A different actor appeared instead of him.
It was disappointing.
Secondly discounts were not available.
Even though I brought a discount token which I was given by a travel agency.
What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished, because the show started at 20:15.
It should have started at 19:30 as you said in your advertisement, and you should not have closed it before the show finished.
It was not a perfect evening whatsoever.
I would like to ask for my money back.
My grandchildren will wear 100 years from now.
As you can imagine, people will be lazier than now.
Everything will be useful and , even fashion.
The clothes will be more comfortable but less decorative.
People will put on fitted suits such as diving suits or perhaps wear nothing.
For instance, people will not care about what other people see.
Or maybe we will not need to see each other any more.
 will not be important with clothes in 100 years' time.
The most important thing will be your figure, .
Even though the clothes , the traditional clothes will continue to exist, because fashion has .
I am 17 years old, and my life has been very normal.
Since I got a computer with a connection to the Internet, my social life has changed.
Now I have more friends and I have more fun.
This has helped me a lot, because I can talk with my friends who live in other countries.
Computers have a lot of programs that help you communicate with others in an easier way.
'Speak Freely' is fantastic, you don't pay and you can hear the voice of the one you miss.
This has opened another world to me, distances aren't so sad, they are shorter.
I have learned a lot with the Internet.
It gives me the opportunity to know more about things I never knew about.
It is incredible how it opens up another reality, a different view of life.
Now I have a different lifestyle, I am more open to the world's problems and progress.
I am interested in reading articles and developing myself.
Technology has given me another life, it has helped me.
My knowledge has been developed and also my lifestyle.
I think that modern technology is our future, we don't have to depend on it, but we have to work for the biggest improvement.
Last month I was in London for a week to visit your wonderful city and with the intention of seeing the famous musical show Over the rainbow at your theatre but in all my life I have never had such a disappointing evening.
First of all, my cousin, who lives there, had had many problems with the tickets.
The line-up was changed and that was the worst surprise I could have had.
My greatest wish was to see Danny Brook's performance; you know he's the best singer.
But instead of him there was an unknown young actor.
What a pity, I thought.
I arrived there on time, 19:15, in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15.
What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected.
I hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should have been a luxury restaurant where I could eat.
But it was closed because it was under construction.
I hope that my request is accepted.
We are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
What technology could be out of control? Since the scientific revolution and the Industrial Revolution, between the 17th and 18th centuries there have been sudden changes in our daily way of life.
Nowadays, especially in the western area of the world, science and technology have taken great, enormous steps in the direction of progress.
Not only for the great nations, but also for each of their inhabitants.
For me it's very important that my mobile and computer are never broken.
I think I would go crazy without them, not only me but the majority of us.
But sometimes I'd rather switch them off and think of what I might be wasting, like love and friendship.
I wish all the world would do the same.
Vico says that progress stops when Man has noticed that he has been wasting those values.
Hi.
My name is Taeron Jon.
And I would like to inform you that something is not right and is unfair about your theatre.
I recently had a week's holiday in London.
During my stay I went to your theatre to see a musical show and unfortunately I had a very disappointing evening.
First of all, you said Danny Brook was in the play but a different actor was in the role.
It was just unbelievably disappointing because the reason, I mean the main reason, which made me go was to see Danny Brook.
Secondly, about the time.
If it's delayed you should have told us before.
Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing.
Due to the late start, it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait outside for another hour to get a taxi.
It was freezing outside and I got a horrible cold because of that.
Lastly, about the ticket.
The advertisment said 'Discounts Available' but no way, I had to pay the full £ 20.00 and the restaurant was closed because of rebuilding or something.
However, the point that I am trying to make is that you just ruined my holiday.
For me, It's not easy to get a holiday and your play just blew my precious time away.
Let me make it clear, you wasted my time and money.
I don't think your play worth £ 20.00.
Your advertisement was unfair.
As you are a manager, you have responsibility for this problem.
and I have a right to get fair treatment as a customer.
So, therefore, I would like you to pay some money back.
I am not asking for full payment but at least 50% of what I paid for nothing but the disappointment.
Fashion, what is fashion? Popular design of clothes.
In a particular time? Maybe.
But I say fashion is Artistic inspiration which is expressed by fabric and all sorts of material.
In some way, fashion is combined with science as well.
Nowadays, fashion plays a big role in our daily life.
A million kinds of fashion magazines and newspapers tell you how much people are interested in fashion.
What about after 100 years? I believe we'll be more into fashionable stuff.
As I said before, fashion is somehow influenced by science and inspirations that we get from all sorts of environments.
Scientific developments produce new materials like waterproof or fireproof fabrics.
For example, space suits.
These days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently.
But we don't wear them.
Frankly we can't because we think it's too odd or strange.
But what about 100 years later? I expect human beings will live on other planets and travel around under the sea.
Can you imagine you and your friends going on a picnic to the Moon with a silvery skirt with astronaut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots? It could be more fascinating.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE.
SECONDLY, AS I WROTE BEFORE, THE PLAY STARTED LATE, AND FOR ME IT WAS TERRIBLE TO WAIT FORTY-FIVE MINUTES.
THIRDLY, I WAS VERY EMBARRASSED TO DISCOVER THERE WERE NO DISCOUNTS AT THE ENTRANCE.
FINALLY I COULDN'T EAT EITHER.
IN FACT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED, WHICH WAS NOT WHAT I'D EXPECTED.
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS.
THIS WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS FOR HIM.
SO MANY TIMES HE WAS TOLD: "PAT, I WILL TELL THIS SECRET ONLY TO YOU".
PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY A FEW DAYS, AFTER WHICH THE SECRET CAME FROM DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID.
THIS WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIS FRIENDSHIPS: HE ALWAYS LOST HIS FRIENDS.
HE WANTED TO DIE BECAUSE OF THIS.
THE WORST THING WAS THAT HE COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS BEHAVIOUR.
ONE DAY FORTUNE HELPED OUR POOR PAT.
ON THE BUS HE SAW A THIEF WHILE HE WAS STEALING A WALLET, HE WANTED TO SCREAM, BUT HE WAS ASTONISHED.
WHEN THE ROBBER REALISED HE COULD BE DISCOVERED AND HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T KEEP THIS SECRET I WILL KILL YOU".
PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED.
EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVERY AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS.
Most people think modern technologies aren't as positive as they are often presented to be.
My personal theory is completely different.
I always have a positive approach with all of the most recent inventions or any other kind of modern appliance.
We live in the age of personal computers, of the Internet, of the mobile phone, and now for me it's impossible to think of a world without them.
It's already four years since I bought my first cellular phone (since then I have changed it many times) and it is always very useful for me: everyone can speak with me wherever I am.
When, for example, I go abroad I feel closer to my friends and to my family than before.
Anyway, the thing that has changed my daily life most is the personal computer and, especially, the Internet.
For example, now I'm writing my thesis, but I use my PC every time I have to write a document that has to look perfect.
I would like to point out the problems I encountered when I went to watch your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' at the Circle Theatre.
In your advertisement, you had written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing.
However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing.
I had expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.
Also, the times printed in your advertisement were 14.30 and 19:30.
I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15.
I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late.
In your advertisement, it said that discounts were available for the tickets.
However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available.
I was rather thirsty and hungry after the show and your advertisement made a cup of tea and some cakes in your restaurant sound rather inviting.
However, to my disappointment, the restaurant was closed because it was being redecorated.
It was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisement said it would be, and I would like some money back.
I hope you will give these problems your immediate attention.
When I overheard girls from other forms gossiping about me and my latest crush, I was furious.
I was seething.
On that day, Pat and I stopped being friends.
I moved away that year, to a whole new place and a whole new school.
Once in a while my old schoolmates came and visited me and we had lots of fun together, just like the old times.
However, I felt I could not talk to them about the problems I was having, my parents getting a divorce.
When my parents told me the news, I was stunned, dazed.
My dad began packing his things the very next day, to move to his new apartment where he would live while waiting for the divorce papers .
That period of my life was one of the worst.
I went into a depression, and no matter who tried to make me feel better, I only felt worse.
However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat.
She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days.
She told me she had heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help.
When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed.
She was a person I could turn to, I could trust.
She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do with anyone.
Ever since, she has had my trust and I have told her my feelings and secrets.
Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul.
She kept every single one of my secrets well, and, not surprisingly, she became my best friend.
Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.
My happiness was short-lived.
When I came home from school one day, I received a phone call from Pat's mum, and in a voice choked with tears she told me that Pat had died in an accident.
She had been killed by a speeding car.
The news shook me to the very core.
I cried for days on end, eating and sleeping very little.
I fell into a deep depression, and took an extremely long time to recover.
I still miss Pat, but my pain is nearly over now.
I could only comfort myself by reminding myself that at least she died knowing I had forgiven her for telling my secret.
I saw your advertisement for your show at the circle theatre, over the rainbow.
I went to it, but I was really disappointed about something.
First the show, Over the Rainbow, started at 20:15, and in the advertisement it was written that it would start at 19:30.
Then it was also written that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show a different actor appeared, that was really disappointing.
Also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but there weren't any discounts.
And because of the time that the show started I couldn't go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed.
Sir, I was very disappointed with the show so I want my money back, and I am sure you will understand my reasons.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to talk about the things I had told her.
First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometres from Earth and then I was so ashamed because I have been her boyfriend since I came to Earth.
My confession caused a disaster in her life and that of her family, and they called the police to take me off of the planet or to be arrested, so that I couldn't see her again.
The police caught me, when I was peacefully in my room, and put me, covered with something, in a car.
After they caught me I think they brought me to Area 57, where the police do experiments.
Since then I have lived in Area 57, and this is my diary .
I don't now when I am going to be free to go to my planet.
I want to talk to you about an evening I had in your theatre, seeing: OVER THE RAINBOW.
Your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthusiasm.
But I had a very disappointing evening and it was because of many things.
First point, I didn't see Danny BROOK .
I went to see him but there was a different actor.
Second point, the show was meant to begin at 7:30 PM but we waited for forty-five minutes to see the show start.
Third point, your advertisement told us about a "discount available" on the price of the ticket but there wasn't one.
My plan is very simple: a description first and an analysis second .
Every day at 7:00 a.m, I am woken up by my radio.
Afterwards, when I have my breakfast, I use my toaster for my bread and, as I want hot milk, I use my modern cooker too.
When I go to school, I can see the new tools they've just received in many stores.
But I think that the most important thing is my cellular phone: I can make a call or receive a call from anywhere.
This little essay shows that I depend on technology and, moreover, because I'm in an electronic engineering school, I'm keen on technology.
I don't know if it is good or bad but we are a generation which has grown up with technology's progress.
Modern technology doesn't change my daily life, it just allows me to in this new world....
I'm writing to complain about the show that I recently attended at your theatre.
During my visit there some problems occurred that made my evening completely disappointing.
Firstly, when I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available.
However, the serious problems appeared later.
The play not only started 45 minutes after it was planned, but when the actors eventually appeared on the stage, I also saw that Danny Brook had been replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role.
To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information being given about the reason for its closure.
As you see, my evening in your theatre really wasn't perfect.
I hope I will get a full refund.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Have you ever thought of the year 2100? Do you think that the world will be different from the present-day world then? I would answer "yes" to both questions.
And if I were asked, "What will be completely different in the year 2100," I would say: clothes.
Most of the scientists, when asked about the Earth in a hundred years, claim that it is going to be absolutely scorching here then.
In my opinion, if the weather is so good people will very quickly forget about any winter clothes.
What is more, the ground will be so hot that walking will only be possible in huge shoes, which will be massive, but not heavy at all.
Another effect of the scorching weather could be that people won't be allowed to go out of the building unless they wear specially designed caps or hats, made of materials that aren't known yet.
I am from Brazil and I recently had a holiday in London.
During my stay I read an advertisement for a musical show being put on at The Circle Theatre.
As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the musical.
When I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not available.
Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good.
So I sat in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, which is an unacceptable delay.
Despite this I was still excited about the show, but then I suddenly realised that Danny Brook was not performing, he had been replaced by an extremely disappointing actor.
The night was terrible, but it could have been saved by a nice dinner in your restaurant, but it was closed because the heater was not working due to a leak.
As you can see it was not the perfect evening out your advertisement talked about.
So, I would be glad if you could give me my money back.
Modern technology has brought us many inventions which have made our daily lives much easier.
For example, the Internet has given us the opportunity to access reliable information very fast.
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances.
That is exactly what has happened to me.
When I was younger, I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching in libraries, looking for old books.
Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine.
But technology is not just about studying, it is entertainment too! I can watch pay-per-view films without having to go out to rent one.
I can also listen to CDs, play the latest games, watch concerts..
everything in a zap.
You also have fast food, or food made in the microwave within a few minutes.
As you can see, technology is about saving time, so we may have more time to do what we like.
In my opinion, technology is making my life much better by doing that.
I am writing to you because of the latest musical show you put on in the Circle Theatre.
I am keen on musicals and I have seen many of them in different parts of the world.
Unfortunately, the one I saw a week ago in the Circle Theatre was one of the worst.
Here are some facts explaining why me and many other people from the audience are so disappointed.
First of all, the musical should have started at 19.30 but unfortunately we had to wait forty-five minutes.
It was a waste of time.
Moreover, the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical is played by the great Danny Brook.
I must admit I'd been looking forward to seeing him.
In fact on the stage appeared a completely different person.
Also, discounts for tickets weren't available.
After the show, together with my friends I went to the theatre restaurant to have a romantic supper.
Unfortunately it was closed for no good reason.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Besides this little thing she is actually perfect.
But to make everything clear I'll start from the beginning.
It was two years ago.
School finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with so much spare time.
I didn't want to spend that holiday with my parents in the country.
I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends.
Tim made a suggestion about going to the seaside in his new car.
It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree.
We had to find another way out.
We planned to tell them that we were going to a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French.
Our parents were very pleased and happy we were so ambitious.
Of course, we didn't want to go there, it was just a "cover".
We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we waited.
We promised to keep it secret.
Two days before going, Pat was packing her luggage and asked her mother to help her.
During their chat Pat mentioned the seaside and her mother found out that something was wrong.
Pat started to cry and told everything.
As a result we were grounded for all the holidays and all because of our almost perfect Pat.
I am writing to complain about the Musical 'Over the Rainbow', performed at the Circle theatre last week.
To begin with, there were no discounts available, and nobody seemed to be able to explain the reason why.
Second, the musical started forty-five minutes late! and, to make matters worse, the actor was not Danny Brook as the advertisement said.
The new actor was not as good as Danny Brook, and he did not perform in the show as he should have done.
What was supposed to be a perfect evening out turned out to be a disappointing one instead.
I am afraid something should be done about this, and I urge you to refund my ticket.
Technology creates for me a lot of new possibilities every day, and it also makes everything easier.
If I want to know how a friend is, I just have to phone him; I can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television, and I can cook in a few minutes using the Microwave oven.
However, there are a lot of negative aspects to the way that technology affects my life.
As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job.
In conclusion, I think that technology has two faces which affect my life as well as everybody else's life.
I believe that we should try to change these bad aspects, or learn to live with them.
Last week I was on holiday in London and I went to the theatre for but I wish I'd not gone there because everything went wrong.
I bought a ticket at the box office but there were not any discounts for students like you said in the advertisement for the show and also the show was meant to start at 19.30 but on that day it was delayed about 45 minutes.
During the show I expected to see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor, and Tina Truelove.
There were Robert Alan and Jack Ruby instead of them.
It really disappointed me.
After the show finished I wanted to visit your restaurant and I found that it was closed.
There was a sign in front of the restaurant: "sorry we are closed for special reasons".
And I was wondering what the reasons were for that.
Finally, I would like to have a refund for my ticket because it was a horrible evening.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
That was why our great plan for our holiday was not .
It happened last summer.
We planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we couldn't tell our parents because they wouldn't allow us to go.
We started our journey and we arrived at our destination by 6 o'clock in the evening.
The sun was shining and the wind was blowing like we had imagined.
While I was standing on the beach, suddenly I heard someone call my name and say that I had to go home.
That is right, it was my mum.
She told me Pat had phoned her while we were leaving and my mum followed us because it was so dangerous to go by bicycle.
.
From now on, I don't want to tell Pat anything secret because she always tells someone else but she is still my best friend.
I recently had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see "Over the Rainbow".
To tell the truth, it was a very disappointing evening.
When I first read the advertisement, I thought that it would be fun.
In the advertisement, it said that the show was London's newest and best musical show.
Well, it might be the newest one but certainly, it was not the best one.
I thought that the actor of the show was Danny Brook, but he was not playing in the show.
The actor was somebody else and this was disappointing.
The show should have started at 19:30 but it started at 20:15 which meant I had to wait there for 45 minutes.
And also, it said that discounts were available but they were not.
I paid £20 and now I would be pleased if you would give some of my money back.
It was a terrible evening out for me.
I hope the next musical show will be a better one.
In the past, everything was very different.
People had completely different lifestyles.
People used candles to see around them.
In winter, they used to burn some wood to keep warm.
"Computer" was a word that nobody knew the meaning of .
As my mum told me, when she was young, only a few people had televisions in their houses.
And of course, they were black and white.
Their hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot.
We use mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or in a desert.
You can communicate with other people any time you want.
Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every area of our lives.
We also have the Internet, with which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.
Modern technology is very important for all the countries.
It has a very big role in developing a country.
When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used for everything.
I saw your advertisement yesterday.
I have visited the Circle Theatre.
I would like to say that I am not satisfied with it.
First of all, there were different actors.
I was disappointed.
The other point is that the organization was very bad.
For example, it was said the show started at 19.30 but it started at 20:15.
I waited around one hour.
Now I have a cold because it was so cold that evening.
Thirdly, I would like to enquire about the tickets.
Firstly, twenty pounds is a lot of money for such a ; also it was said that a discount was available.
It was untrue.
I paid twenty pounds.
The other thing I would like to ask is why it is said this is London's newest and best musical show.
I can say it is the worst musical show.
And I was invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show.
But it was closed because there was not anything to drink or to eat.
Finally it was not the perfect evening out.
In conclusion, I really did not like it.
I want to ask if it is possible to give me my money back.
Modern technology has changed my daily life very much.
At present, technology develops rapidly.
In my opinion, the world cannot do without it.
Firstly, I would like to mention that in our daily life we always use some technological appliances.
For instance, a TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others.
Another point is that with the help of technology we can communicate with the whole world.
Without doubt, the invention of the computer is the most important technological event.
It is very useful.
Almost everything is dependent on computers, for example, education, research into the universe and other things.
Another thing I would like to say is that modern technology helps us to get anywhere we want to go rapidly.
The most are planes.
The other thing I would like to mention about how important modern technology is concerns the fact we study our planet, other planets and many other things with its help.
Finally I think that at present life is more comfortable than it was in the past.
In my opinion, no one can do without modern technology.
It continues to develop and always will be the most important thing in our life.
I am writing this letter to let you know what I think about the musical show which you (The Circle Theatre) presented.
I bought a group ticket for the show, because there were 7 of us.
I saw "discount available" in the advertisement.
When I asked .
I forgot about it, because I wanted to see this show, because my favourite actor appears in it.
During the show, we didn't see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor.
Another one appeared in the show.
We were really angry, because you told us a lie.
If Danny Brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theatre.
This is your unforgivable mistake.
After the show, we were still angry.
We wanted to eat something in your theatre restaurant.
When we went to the restaurant, we saw that it was closed.
I was sure that we could visit it after the show as that was written on the advertisement.
We were hungry and angry this time.
This was a very bad evening for us.
We were bored with waiting.
We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show.
We were hungry after the show.
But we couldn't eat anything and we couldn't get a discount.
When I went to school, I wrote a letter to my friends, because I didn't have a mobile phone.
Now I have got a mobile phone and I always use it.
It's fast and easy.
But sometimes I miss the letters.
I miss waiting for the postman every morning.
Before we had a computer, I played games with my friends in our garden or in their garden.
We played a lot of games during the day.
When we had a computer, I started to play computer games.
I didn't want to play games outside with my friends, because the computer was more interesting than my friends.
I use the Internet now.
I don't buy a newspaper, because I can read my newspaper on the Internet.
I can buy things on the Internet.
For example, I sent a flower to my mum on mother's day .
My daily life is changing.
Everything is easy now.
I can send an email to my friend who lives in Canada.
I never forget important days, because I have got a data-bank.
When the important day is approaching, it tells me.
Life is really easy.
You need to learn how you can use technology.
But, sometimes, I miss the old days.
I miss playing in the garden, posting a letter to my friends, and forgetting an important day.
Sometimes I want to go somewhere without technology.
I'm writing this letter to express my disappointment with "Over the rainbow", the musical show which I watched yesterday evening.
First of all, according to the advertisement, one of the main actors would be DANNY BROOK, who I love.
Instead of this, I had to watch the performance of a different and unknown actor who wasn't so great as I expected.
Secondly, the show started one hour late and I hate waiting in a queue longer than is necessary.
I felt very upset and my enjoyable night became a stressful, and very expensive one, too.
There wasn't any discount available for the tickets and I went to the theatre with my three cousins from Brazil.
In addition to this, after the show, we looked for the theatre restaurant which had been closed for repairs one month ago.
In conclusion, last night definitely was the worst entertainment experience I've ever had in my life and that's why I am asking you for my money back as compensation.
Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship to and the ways we communicate with other people as well as our life expectancy.
With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to communicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us.
Despite the distances, we can keep our friendship close and in a cheap way.
Besides this, the information goes faster than it used to now and it's available at the same time in every part of the world.
On the one hand, our time is taken up with learning how to deal with the new technologies.
On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us with support in our hard tasks and setting us free to apply our intelligence and efforts to more important things.
For instance, we can research new ways of improving our quality of life.
In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware of how they are introduced into our lives to avoid the dangerous side of TECHNOLOGY.
I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW" that I came to see at your theatre during my holiday in London.
Unfortunately that evening wasn't as good as I expected.
Another thing was that the show I went to was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15! The people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long.
And I absolutely agreed with them.
Also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink.
But when I went there, it was closed.
I don't know why and I'd like you to tell me the reason.
Finally, you said that it would be our perfect evening out.
Well it wasn't and I am asking for my money back.
I'd like you to return it to me.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
So, the next day Pat went and told his sister Sally that her friends were organising a surprise party for her birthday.
When Sally heard that, she was very surprised and very excited.
But because she didn't want to disappoint her friends, she was acting as if she didn't know anything.
She let them organise it! But although she was acting like this she was very angry with her brother Pat, because he didn't keep the secret.
To start with, the show, which was supposed to start on 19:30 started on 20:15 so you can understand that we were 45 minutes late getting out as well.
Then, there were not any discounts available for the tickets as was written on the advertisement.
What's more the theatre restaurant was closed for some reasons and we couldn't get anything to drink or eat after the show.
On top of everything, Danny Brook, the star of the night, was absent and his role was performed by a different actor.
You can understand how disappointing this was for all of us.
In my opinion, there are two possible fashions for the future.
If humans change to be more free from social rules, I think that their dress will also be very extreme and unlimited.
There will be a variety of colours and fashion styles.
Everybody will wear anything he/she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange.
On the other hand, if human society changes to become stricter and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of society.
All people will look about the same and mostly dark colours will rule .
Perhaps the style of their dress will indicate their position in society too.
This is what I think the fashion of the future will be like.
The most exciting thing about this is that people won't think that their clothes are strange, just as we don't think ours are.
I'm very sorry to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening.
First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I needed some time to buy the tickets.
I bought two tickets for £20 and when I asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then I was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
Then when the show finally started I was very disappointed because I really wanted to see Danny Brook, but instead of him there was another actor.
Later when the show finished, I planned to go to the restaurant and get some food, but it was closed, because it was being repaired.
I would be very grateful if your could return to me half or some of my money, or even make the .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell her something, eventually everyone knows about it.
But this time it was something more important than any other time.
I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat, everything started going wrong.
Katrin, my friend, and the one I was being bad to, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really didn't know what to do.
I was in love with Brett, but I loved my friend too.
So I decided to talk to Brett.
We both decided to finish with this stupid affair.
It was difficult, but it was the best for everyone.
Then I decide to talk to Katrin.
I was very sorry for all I had done, so I apologised to her and promised her that this would never happen again.
Now I'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the whole world.
I'm writing to complain about the performance of Over The Rainbow at The Circle Theatre on the 14th of June.
It is always a great opportunity to enjoy a musical when you go on holiday to London.
London is one of Europe's biggest and you can always find the best in show business there.
Recently I decided to see Over The Rainbow, a very famous and well-known show.
Firstly, the evening performance was 45 minutes late and there were no discounts available as the advertisement had promised.
Furthermore, I was shocked when one of the main actors came onto the stage.
He wasn't Danny Brook, one of the reasons for my choice of coming to see Over the Rainbow.
Finally, the Theatre Restaurant was being refurbished so we had to find another one for our evening meal.
This wasn't "my perfect evening out", as promised, and I'll make a claim for half the money back.
I'm looking forward to receiving your reply as soon as possible.
How has modern technology changed my daily life? A century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plough behind them, the word "time".
Why not talk about social life just sitting around a table with no rush.
Today we have to carry a mobile phone.
I visited an airport some days ago and in nearly every crowded corner I could see those busy people who are always on their way somewhere.
I heard the different ringing tones, and, what a miracle, you can change them on the train when you are restless.
A new world has opened up in our times; tangible proof of this is the computer.
I can send and save information and the possibilities are infinite.
In nearly every home you can find one and the users now and in the future are the new generation.
I must say a few words about the new electrical cars which surely will have a central role to play, especially today when fuel is so expensive.
Watch how highly-advanced technology can be and helpful for me and others, if we only remember the importance of taking time to be together.
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theatre said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there.
First of all, the most annoying thing for me was the absence of Danny Brook because in my country I don't have the chance to enjoy his excellent .
Another actor stood in for him, without any advance warning.
Another thing was the of the show because it started forty-five minutes late without any reason being given.
In addition to all this, there was no discount on the price of the tickets for students either, contrary to what I was told on the phone when I asked for more information.
Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theatre's restaurant.
But, to our surprise, it was closed.
At the end of all these , we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint.
So, because of the things I have mentioned, I think I should be given some money back.
I look forward to receiving some information from you.
When this technological changes so quickly, I obviously feel that my life changes too in many fields.
I would say that the worst thing about this development for me is that I experience more and more stress in almost every aspect of my life.
There is not enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life is devoted to my duties without leaving any time for pleasures.
Apart from this, another disadvantage is the pollution we all live with in the majority of cities, to breathe fresh air several days a month when we go to the country.
In addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
Apart from this, advanced computer technology allows me to contact anyone the moment that I want to, while five years ago, when I did not have a computer, I had to write letters, which was a slower way to contact people.
On the other hand, and in conclusion, I think that this development has made my life more comfortable .
I am writing in order to complain about the Musical , OVER THE RAIN, I went to see at the theatre.
In the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny Brook, and to my surprise there was a different actor, and that really disappointed me.
Then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour late.
I had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
And the theatre restaurant was being painted, so I could not go there .
As you may understand it was not a perfect night and I was not pleased with the show or even with the service.
That is why I am going to ask you for my money back.
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
Technology, are we prepared for these advances? It changes every day and I do not know if we will be able to understand it.
Technology improves our lives, we have high-tech equipment for cooking, for work, for study, well nearly for everything.
Nearly all of us today know what the Internet is about, but one or two years ago we did not.
And when we understood the Internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
But now we can even see the face of the person we are chatting to.
The Internet is amazing.
And now of course there will be someone trying to improve it.
Technology changes our daily life, it makes our life easy to live and of course more comfortable with computers, televisions, radios et cetera and sometimes safer, as with medicine.
Definitely we should try to understand technology.
If we know how to use it, technology will improve our way of life.
I am writing in connection with the musical show your theatre company has put on recently, and, I want you to know, it has really disappointed me.
To begin with, the actor the advertisement showed did not appear, which I found very rude, and disappointing.
Moreover, the show started at a quarter past eight, forty-five minutes later than it should have .
I paid twenty pounds for my ticket because, as you may know, there were not any discounts available.
It is for this reason I think you should give me some money back.
To sum up, I would like to make my point about what happened in the restaurant after the show.
It was closed because its owner had decided to go on holiday.
However, nobody told me.
I think you have to do something about this to avoid it happening again.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
If I had know it before, I would never have told her, because then it was really important for me, but, anyway, now, it doesn't really matter to me.
At the time, Pat and I had a close relationship.
I told her everything that happened to me and vice versa.
We had many things in common and we knew each other as if we were sisters.
However, one day our friendship was broken .
I told her I was falling in love with my best friend and she decided to tell everybody in our , despite knowing that it must stay a secret.
When I met Caballos, my best friend, I felt embarrassed and disappointed and I couldn't say anything.
I was at a loss.
Now I wish all of this had never happened, while I try to forget it, laughing with Caballos and Pat.
I'm writing to you to complain about the show presented by Circle Theatre last Tuesday.
The fact is it was quite different from the one I had expected to see.
First of all, Danny Brook wasn't the leading actor, though his name was printed on the flyer.
I had been looking forward to seeing his performance for ages, so as soon as I realized there was a substitute on the stage, I was really disappointed.
I was angry because the show started at 20:15 instead of 19.30, too.
Considering that I had to buy a full-price ticket (even though I had read on the flyer that discounts would be available), I think you can understand my anger.
I suggest you should solve these problems quickly.
If I were you, I should keep open the theatre restaurant, because I heard people saying it was a pity it was closed.
I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life.
Neither do I.
In particular I'd like to talk about the Internet.
I think that the Internet has changed my daily life most of all.
In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
Therefore I regard the Internet as quite a powerful tool and I believe it has given more strength to relationships between people.
In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net.
I can say such things because I use the net in the same way and I'm really astounded by the way it has changed my daily life.
Further to the unpleasant event that took place last week, it is my right to complain about the musical show I saw when I was in London.
First of all, when we arrived we went to pay and we gave a discount ticket.
It was not valid but the worst thing was that nobody explained the reason to us.
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it did not start until 8:15.
Then I felt disappointed because the main actor had been changed.
It would not have been such a terrible thing if the new actor acted as well as the other one.
If that does not seem enough, after the show my boyfriend wanted to take me to eat something in the theatre's restaurant but the unpleasant surprise was that it was closed because all the waiters were on holiday.
After explaining my complaints to you I hope you send me some money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It was our last school year, so we decided to organize a trip to celebrate the fact we had finally finished school.
We knew that our parents wouldn't let us travel alone so we had to invent a story to avoid them realising what had happened.
Kim, Kate and Pat told their parents they were going to travel with the school and so did I.
We were excited and we started to organise everything.
We booked some rooms in a hotel, next to the beach, and we bought all the useful things we were going to need.
It seemed like the perfect holiday but it wasn't.
Pat was in love with my eldest brother, whose name is Jon (I have never got on well with him).
Pat told him our idea.
Poor Pat, she didn't know my brother, she didn't know how he was.
Jon told my parents what we wanted to do.
We lost our holiday.
When the show was finished we went to the restaurant to have something to eat.
But then it was closed for repairs.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She was my best friend for several years as a child.
But I haven't seen her since we were 10 years old.
When were nine years old and were in third grade we had a 'House' where we used to play all afternoon.
In fact it wasn't a real house, it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house.
But we used to call it 'Our House'.
It was a secret place and we had promised each other not to tell anybody about it.
Usually we were cooking flower soup, and swapping secrets.
One day when I was there alone, I heard some other kids approaching.
I sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
One minute later, Pat and half our class stood in 'the House' looking and laughing at me and my flower soup.
Maybe she did it to make friends.
But in fact that day she had lost my friendship.
I am writing to complain about a musical show, which I saw in your theatre in London during my holiday.
Considering the advertisement, which appeared in one of London's newspapers, I would like to present you with some of my complaints about your musical spectacle.
Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you "advertised", has been changed.
The man who played the main male role was not the one who was mentioned in the advertisement.
Secondly, the time when your musical should start was changed, delaying your show for nearly one hour! In your advertisement I noticed some information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another "defect" in the advertisement was an "invitation" to the restaurant after the show.
For unknown reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information giving a reason for closing it).
Finally, you guaranteed "a perfect evening out", but for me it was the worst visit to the theatre in two years .
To sum up, I am very disappointed about the musical in your theatre.
Neither the beautiful surroundings near your theatre nor the comfortable seats compensated for my horrible evening.
Therefore, I would like you to send my money back, because I think I deserve it as a member of the audience.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Technology is very important in our life.
Mainly, because it makes it easier and more comfortable.
Nevertheless, it has some advantages and drawbacks.
In my opinion, my daily life is full of modern technology.
I meet it "at every corner": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on.
It also changed my lifestyle for the better - I think.
Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done, a washing machine which makes my clothes clean again.
Today, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers, the Internet, super-fast cars etc.
These improvements help me with my ordinary chores.
I can do my homework on a computer, prepare for the class test by searching for information on the Internet and use a mobile phone every time I want to talk with one of my parents.
However, technology has a bad influence on us - generally on our health.
A couple of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones .
Also fast and high-tech cars increase the risks of pollution in our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents.
In conclusion, I think that modern technology makes our life easier.
Nevertheless, we should avoid any possible risks connected with these improvements.
Then we will be able to say that technology is something we should be proud of.
I am writing with regard to your advertisement.
During my 2 weeks' holiday I wanted to attend a musical show.
It was my favourite musical.
I was very hopeful that I was going to have a good time.
But there were a lot of things which went wrong.
Firstly, I had no discount when I paid.
Secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble.
After the show I couldn't catch my train.
Because I didn't have any plan I decided to have lunch in the theatre restaurant.
But it was closed.
The worst thing is that I couldn't see my favourite actor.
I was so disappointed about that.
I couldn't concentrate on the play any more.
In contrast to the advertisement everything was disappointing.
I regret to have to demand all my money back.
I hope you are going to be take into consideration my terrible experience.
Technology has developed in recent years.
As a result of this our society has changed a lot.
Nowadays students have many more facilities in education than before.
Although in those days the only way of learning was reading.
These days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once.
Then with technology we can reach any place in the world easily.
We can get information more quickly.
Technology has a huge effect on our spare-time activities as well.
Children play with computers instead of the usual toys.
Despite the huge advantages, technology has affected our lives negatively.
There has been a change in the relationships between people.
People are getting more and more lonely.
We have noticed the environmental damage in recent years.
I am writing to you to complain about the show which I saw last Friday at your theatre.
The show was called 'Over the Rainbow'.
I was not pleased with the way that it was .
First of all, when I went and bought my ticket, there was no discount, but in your advertisement it clearly said that discounts are available and as a result the ticket I bought was more expensive.
Secondly, the show I went to was the evening one, which was supposed to start at 7:30 p.m., but there was a 41-minute delay and it ended up starting at 8.15 p.m.
Furthermore, the actor was Danny Brook but who acted terribly and was very disappointing.
Last of all, it says in your advertisement that there is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made.
I am writing this letter to mention all the disappointing events in the Circle Theatre production of "Over The Rainbow".
I went to see it on time as it was advertised at 19:30 but it started at 20:15, with a delay of 45 minutes.
What is more, about the tickets, discounts were not available .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He told everything that Pandora said to everyone who Pandora didn't want to know.
Pandora had done something very bad like a robbery and one day told this to Pat because she was very and regretful.
Pat was her best friend so she told him.
However, she didn't know that Pat couldn't keep secrets well.
One day, while all their friends were there and talking, Pat told everyone that Pandora had done a robbery.
All of them were shocked by what they heard.
As well as this, they started to talk about it everywhere.
After a week on holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that all of her friends knew about that.
She became very and angry.
She couldn't talk with people and she was just very sad.
Finally, she couldn't wait and went to talk to Pat.
He admitted that it was his fault and told everyone that it was a joke to make Pandora a bit angry.
After all that, they again became good friends but Pat learned to keep secrets.
Yesterday I went to the play called "Over the Rainbow", for which I saw the advertisement in today's Guardian.
I want to tell you that I am very disappointed about the play.
In the advertisement it said that Danny Brook was in the starring role.
However I didn't see him all night.
There was another actor instead of him.
And also it should have started at 19.30, as I saw in the advertisement, but it started at 20.15! And there weren't any discounts available which were said to be "available" in the advertisement.
I went to the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because of the redecoration works inside.
You should have written it in the advertisement.
And after all that, no one can say that I had a perfect evening out! it was very disappointing so I want my money back.
Today 5 out of every 10 pupils can use a computer .
And almost everybody has a television in their homes.
These 2 devices make my life easier.
I can't go out all the time or be with my friends to have fun.
So I watch TV at home instead of sitting in a chair looking out of a window.
I play on the computer more than watching TV when I get bored.
The Internet is the world's largest communication system .
I can do anything I want, such as buy CDs, watch a film or even buy food.
It is really enjoyable when I chat with people.
The Internet has brought a new to my life since I started to use it.
It is easy and very useful.
I can that I want to.
Technology is also important in another area for me.
Transportation.
I don't have to walk to school every day for 8 months.
Cars, buses and trains are very useful in daily life.
Lots of things would be hard and boring in my life if I was living in a different time than now.
I can easily do what I want.
Technology has brought simple solutions to my life.
I'd like to complain about your '' musical show, which I went to when I had a week's holiday in London.
I felt really disappointed because the things you said in the advertisement weren't true.
I went there at 19.00 because the show started at 19.30 as the advertisement said but I queued for at least an hour because the ticket machine broke down.
Finally, after an hour, when my turn came to buy the entrance ticket, your staff said I couldn't have a discount and .
However, I bought the ticket, even though it was expensive, because I'd been queuing for ages and I really wanted to see my idol, Danny Brook.
I had a very disappointing evening and my anger influenced me for the rest of my holidays.
I'd like to know if you can give the money back to me or I'll write letters to all the media departments to show how deceitful you were.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He went to see the headmaster and told him the whole truth.
Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane at the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster's back after he punished Jon.
The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspension from school for a week.
This happened on Thursday afternoon.
When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster walked round the school every Thursday.
But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board.
Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit  the headmaster's head.
Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger.
He then punished Jon but the one who did it was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster to us.
Pat heard that and he went to see the headmaster straight after school.
The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished them for their bad behaviour.
After that event , Pat was Jon and Tim's enemy.
They both got into trouble because of him.
They hate him so much.
Unfortunately I have to complain about the musical show put on in your Circle Theatre last night.
When I received your advertisement concerning the show "Over the Rainbow" I thought that I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
Maybe I will start from the beginning.
First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was absent.
The show had a 45-minute delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts - what kind of discounts? I didn't see any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to pay for a full-price ticket.
Because the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday.
Hereby I have to ask for my money back or a discount for me.
Waiting for your reply.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
The story began last year, when I my summer holiday.
I had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if I had concrete plans.
I started telling my parents that I would be travelling with my friends through West Europe for one month.
I had a really good plan but no good friends.
I received quite a lot of money and I left home.
For one week I really was travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone.
Now I don't think that it was a good idea.
Sometimes I had to sleep on railway stations or under bridges.
After one month, I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I don't know why I was such a liar.
My parents believed my story until my younger brother Pat told them the truth.
Now my parents don't believe my story.
But I think this was a good lesson for me and I don't lie any more.
The reason I decided to write you a letter, will, I guess, surprise you.
I hope you will not feel offended, but I really need to complain about your theatre.
I was present at your musical show: "Over the rainbow".
I was very excited thinking about being at the theatre, and I thought with certainty I was going to enjoy my evening.
Really, what a mess with the administration.
Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be given either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful customer.
For my part, I know it would be such a pain in the neck.
The more I think of it, the more I realise I use modern technology a lot.
I guess I could not live without lots of devices.
Modern technology changed my daily life by making it easier and by turning me into a lazy woman.
Nevertheless, this easy life has then offered me the chance to be more relaxed and I think it is essential.
My composition is going to focus on two main ideas: how modern technology has changed my home life and how it affects my personal and professional life.
Technology makes housework easier.
I can't imagine how my life would be without a washing machine, a drier or a fridge.
During the winter, when it is raining, you can have your clothes dry in less than thirty minutes.
That's fantastic.
Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work.
I am thinking mostly of computers.
Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day.
The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a large amount of information in the minimum space.
Also, the e-mail system is really helpful.
Thanks to the invention of the Internet I can contact lots of colleagues all around the world every day (and with the minimum cost).
But, in my opinion, the best thing is that I can stay at home or go on holiday, and send my work to the office every day.
I am writing to complain about a very disappointing evening I recently had during a week's holiday in London.
My girlfriend and I read an advertisement for the show "Over the Rainbow", which is very popular.
She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available.
When we asked for discount tickets, we were told there never were discount offers and that we had to pay for the most expensive tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students.
We were annoyed about it but we paid up.
We took our places, and began chatting with other people.
We had to wait until 8.15 pm before it started, whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook.
My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.
After that we thought we could have a drink in your theatre restaurant but it was closed because the decor was being changed.
Finally we had the worst evening I have ever imagined, it was definitely not the "perfect evening" as written in the advertisement.
So I want my money back for these two tickets - I have included a copy of them - and I hope you will pay more attention to the way you treat your customers, and avoid false advertising.
How interesting it is to imagine what kind of clothes people will wear in about a hundred years from now.
Fashion is changing so quickly that all our dreams about clothes can come true.
But let's see my point of view.
In a hundred years, the clothes will certainly be totally different from ours.
Materials, textures and colours change, and our minds too.
So I think people will wear clothes made of recycled things, like aluminium bottles.
And I hope colours won't be dark and sad but very bright and enjoyable to see.
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not jeans.
Synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so they would keep going .
But maybe the shape of the clothes will change: large "baggy" pants, or trousers with many pockets as we see today.
For women, clothes change more than for men.
It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of dressing.
I guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because they want to change.
Finally it's very difficult to say what .
Maybe Luc Besson's movie "Fifth Element" is quite a good example.
The clothes were designed by the famous Jean-Paul Gaultier.
And it really is an interesting point of view.
To conclude, in the end clothes won't be what we think they will be today, and it's a good thing because we can only imagine and follow the trend of fashion that makes us feel pretty and happy.
According to the advertisement Danny Brook was the male actor.
However, he did not act, and his substitute was not very good at acting.
In addition the theatre restaurant was not open because of the waiters' strike.
In conclusion, not only was my evening horrible but also expensive.
That is why I ask you to refund my money, or at least part of it.
Firstly the main character is Evans, a retired police captain.
He is not as well-known as Poirot or Miss Marple, but his personality is quite interesting.
I am sure you'll agree with me.
Secondly the plot.
It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband.
At least this is Evans' opinion.
Not only is the plot interesting but also it catches your interest from the first moment.
Finally, you should pay attention to the ending, which is surprising.
I recently visited London on holiday and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I am really sorry to say that I was very disappointed with the whole organisation of the musical, starting with the advertisement.
Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook, an actor that I admire and I wanted to see performing.
Unfortunately, instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally unknown to me.
Secondly, in the advertisement, the starting time of the musical was said to be 19:30, but the show started at 20:15.
I don't want to be rude, but this is not professional at all.
Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.
We are living in the 21st century and everybody is surrounded by advanced technology.
As a result of all this advanced technology, I became one of the daily users of modern technology.
Of course using modern technology has both advantages and disadvantages.
The first thing that came to my life and changed it completely is the computer.
I spend most of my time in front of the computer, either working or playing.
Of course this is sometimes an advantage, when for example the computer helps me to do my job more easily, but some other times it is a great disadvantage because it keeps me away from my friends.
But unfortunately I cannot live without a computer.
The first thing I do in the morning is start up my computer, check if I have any new e-mails, check my electronic calendar and then go to work, where I always work with a computer.
Using the computer has become second nature.
And it's not only the computer.
Every day I use the microwave for heating my food and of course I always carry with me my mobile phone.
It is one of the greatest technological achievements and I am afraid to say that I cannot live without my mobile phone.
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology offers  humanity many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good.
It's up to us if we use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier.
The only thing I really is that if you know how to use technology, it is a benefit to you.
If you don't, it is going to destroy you.
I am writing to you to express my disappointment with the musical show 'Over the rainbow.
First, I am very disappointed about the star.
I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear.
Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike.
Also, the musical did not start at 19.30, it started forty-five minutes later.
That is why, because it finished later, I arrived late to a basketball game.
Another thing is that there were not any discounts on the entrance fee.
Finally, the theatre restaurant was closed because it was Sunday.
It is closed every Sunday; you have to say that.
That is why I will be pleased if you give me my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
That's why I didn't want to tell him that I had failed my natural science final exam.
I was worried because if my parents knew that I had failed, before we were on holiday, they would cancel the trip to Africa.
But, I needed to tell someone about it, so I told Pat about it.
The next day, all the class knew about it.
I wasn't too worried because if someone was going to see my parents, I would tell them before not to talk about the exams.
But, then my mother talked to Pat's mother and she mentioned it, and my mother cancelled the trip to Africa.
It wasn't Pat's fault, it was my fault because I was the one who failed the exam and, also, I knew that Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE LAST SATURDAY, AT YOUR SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW".
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATE AND WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKETS.
BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES OF PUTTING ON A PLAY IN THE THEATRE.
BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE TIME IT STARTS AT THE LAST MINUTE, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
YOUR ORGANISATION WAS A GREAT DISASTER.
NOBODY TOLD US ANYTHING ABOUT THE CHANGES, AND WE WANT YOU TO GIVE US BACK THE MONEY WE SPENT.
I FEEL YOU LIED TO ME AND YOUR COMPANY IS NOT PROFESSIONAL.
I WAIT FOR YOUR ANSWER, AND FOR OUR MONEY BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
Pat wasn't the most popular boy in the school.
He was shy, reserved and a very closed person.
He enjoyed himself reading, and playing piano at home.
Despite his way of life, his best friend was Anna, the most popular girl in the school.
She told Pat everything that happened in her life.
.
He started to "sell" Anna's secrets to all the boys in the school who were interested in her.
All the boys in the class went to Pat to find out what Anna was doing at every moment, and Pat was becoming 'friends' with all the boys.
He was very happy, because he felt that everybody loved him.
Everyone apart from Anna.
She didn't tell him anything anymore, and Pat didn't have any secrets to sell to his "new friends".
Finally, Pat didn't have any friends, because he didn't have anything about Anna to sell.
My name is Veronika.
I visited your theatre to see a musical show, "Over the Rainbow".
I am writing to you to say that it was a very disappointing evening.
I'll try to explain why.
First of all, there were different actors in the show, but you didn't say anything about it before the show.
The other point was the beginning of the show.
It started at 20:15, but it was said that it would start at 19:30.
As a result, I missed my train.
The third problem was the discounts.
There were no discounts at all.
But I am a student and I know that I can get tickets with a discount.
Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it.
So in conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully.
We know that everything is changing.
And of course technology is also changing.
Not so long ago we had to do many things by hand, but now there are a lot of machines to do the same.
And it makes our life easier.
Now we have free time to do something else while the machine is doing our work.
our house, our workplace etc.
For example, before, I used to wash my clothes by hand, but now I have the latest version of washing machine and now there are no reasons to do it by hand.
Before, it took me 3 hours, but now it is free time and I can go for a walk with my friends.
Another example is that before we had to rewrite some documents by hand just to make a copy.
Now we have a scanner and a printer to do it.
And it takes about 1 minute to make a copy not 1 hour.
So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the things that are really important in our lives.
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - Over the Rainbow.
I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which was published in the newspaper.
The advert clearly says that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I .
As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15.
The second point is that the show about 30 minutes.
Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way.
Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, because of whom I .
After the show we went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed for refurbishment.
I was not really satisfied with the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out.
I therefore would like to have a refund of the £30 which I spent on the tickets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
My story had already been spread the next day.
Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it.
I didn't think I was going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustworthy.
But since I noticed in the newspaper that I had won the writing competition.
I couldn't believe my luck.
I a return ticket to the Mediterranean Sea.
During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns.
They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends.
The last few days, we spent our time sightseeing and shopping.
I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life.
On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets.
A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind.
My bad luck had never left me.
It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'.
Last week, I had a week's holiday in London, where I hadn't been for 2 years.
I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it.
We were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, , which was your musical show.
At first, you said that if we bought 5 tickets, we would have a discount, but we didn't .
Secondly, we booked for the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
What's wrong with your clock? Thirdly, the person on stage was very strange to me, because I expected to see "Danny Brook", but I didn't.
The last thing is we wanted to have dinner in your restaurant after the terrible musical show, but we couldn't , because a waiter said your chef had gone home.
I have no idea .
I have never seen anything like this.
By the way, I want you to give me my money back because of the wasted time, and I think that you understand.
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad.
I would never have expected that I could be so deceived.
This is not the first time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure "Over the rainbow" will be the last one.
As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of your most devoted customers.
I know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business.
We both know this is not true, or shouldn't be.
When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourite singers, whose career I have been following from the beginning, and Danny Brook never appears, and nobody gives any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay.
Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one could do instead.
Even playing some music to help us take it easy would have been better than nothing! No announcement, no ...oh, yes, I forgot.
The bar was closed.
Well, I will not comment on that point.
That terrible place definitely needed refurbishment.
Well, this is not my idea of a perfect evening out, as you can imagine.
Each time I see the advertisement I get mad.
Of course, you should give a refund for the money spent, not only to me but to all the audience.
But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least not as long as you continue as its manager.
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays.
How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, as always, just a few weeks.
Everything that is in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again.
I am sure that fashion will survive for ages, it will even change to become easier to use and cleaner, because we all need to feel a part of our society, communicate our way of living and thinking, be part of a group and, at the same time, be different.
I'm writing to you to complain about the musical show that I went to last evening.
I had a week's holiday in London, so I wanted to spend my last evening , however it was the worst evening in my life.
First of all, the actors were different from those who were advertised.
Second, the show started at 20:15, although I read that it would start at 19:30! Moreover, after watching the show I wanted to visit your theatre restaurant, but it was closed, it really disappointed me.
How has modern technology changed my daily life? Fifty years ago people didn't even think that after 2000 years they would have another life.
When Thomas Adison invented electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that century.
And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives.
I mean, almost everyone now has a car, a computer, a mobile phone and even an airplane.
My life is changing too.
First of all, now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the Internet.
Second, modern technology helps me in the kitchen.
Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave.
What is more, modern technology prevents different illnesses.
Furthermore, yesterday I heard that every man could fly into space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view, that in the year 2050 everybody will fly into space.
On the other hand, people can of all these inventions.
They become lazy because they know that they can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
In conclusion, I want to say that in spite of this, I hope that in future we will have more and more new inventions and they will prevent our disasters and problems.
I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day at your theatre.
I am afraid that I think that the show was not as good as I expected: the reasons were many.
- Danny brook did not appear and I wanted to see him.
- the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30.
Please check your times because many people had to leave in the middle of the show.
- When the musical finished I was terribly hungry so I decided to have something to eat but the restaurant was closed and the advertisement said that it would be open.
In conclusion, that evening was not "my perfect evening out" so I want you to refund my money.
Modern technology has changed my life in many different ways: But this "modern technology" has advantages and disadvantages.
On the one hand we have the advantages; new technology allows you to do many things like flying, seeing in the dark, or it can even save your life when you are almost dead.
But on the other hand we have the disadvantages.
Technology makes your life easier but for how long? For example, the car was developed through modern technology.
It makes your life easier but also more "dangerous".
Why? Because too many cars means too much CO2 in the air.
And everyone knows that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kinds of animals.
To summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems.
Regarding "Over The Rainbow", presented at your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems.
Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned in the advertisement for this musical show as "Danny Brook".
As I was so looking forward to seeing Danny's performance, I was very disappointed.
I think you should have informed us of the change of star before starting the show.
In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was replaced.
Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisement.
 third point is our tickets were not reduced at all! The Ad says that .
Lastly, your theatre restaurant was already closed when the show finished, because the start of the show was late.
As described above, it could not be a "perfect evening".
There are lots of reasons why I was so disappointed, and could not enjoy the show, you see!! Therefore, I would be grateful if you could give me back some money.
But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday party for Sally on June 2 at her own home.
It should have been "surprising".
Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him.
Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character.
She was not so lucky in her life.
Her parents had already died when she was in high school.
She has no brothers and sisters.
After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have children.
In spite of such difficulties, she always has a pretty, charming smile for us.
On June 2, because of Pat's mistake, Sally already knew our plan.
We were enjoying ourselves at her home celebrating her birthday.
"Oh! You came back for me! Nigel," Sally cried with pleasure.
Nigel himself was a big "surprise" present for Sally.
I will never forget her happy face .....
We had a brilliant night.
Last week I went to London for a holiday.
There I saw the advertisement for this show and I decided to go .
I went to buy the tickets but when I paid there was not any discount available.
In the advertisement you told me I would get a discount.
This was not the worst thing because when I arrived at the theatre I waited forty-five minutes because the show should start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15.
When it started the main actor Danny Brook was not in it, another, worse actor had taken his part.
In my opinion when the main actor cannot do the show it is better not to do the show than to do it with a horrible actor.
When it finished, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they are going to open a new, better restaurant.
In my opinion you should refund my money because the evening and the show were so terrible.
But I did not know it, and I told her my secret: I had fallen in love with Paul, a friend of ours.
No one knew it but her.
That Wednesday Pat phoned me and told me that Sally also loved Paul.
I had also told Sally my secret.
The Thursday Sally phoned me, because we are also friends, but she did not tell me anything about Paul.
When Sally came out of the discotheque I was very angry and I started to shout at her.
She hit me and I decided then that I should never speak to her again.
Paul asked Pat what had happened and she told him my secret.
One friend of mine told me that Pat had told Paul my secret and I went to speak with her.
Now we are friends but I know that I cannot tell her any secrets.
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED WITH THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW AT THIS THEATRE.
FIRST OF ALL, CONTRARY TO WHAT WAS ADVERTISED, THE MAIN ACTOR WAS NOT DANNY BROOK, BUT ANOTHER, UNKNOWN PERSON.
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THE SHOW WAS DELAYED, STARTING AT 20:15.
AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET.
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT AT THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW.
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE THAT EVENING OUT WAS NOT AS PERFECT AS I HAD PLANNED.
SO, I WOULD BE GRATEFUL IF YOU COULD REFUND ALL OR PART OF THE MONEY WHICH I PAID FOR THE SHOW.
IT'S UNDENIABLE THAT DURING THIS CENTURY OUR WORLD HAS BEEN CHANGING.
NEW INVENTIONS HAVE BEEN INVENTED AND SCIENCE HAS MADE QUICK PROGRESS.
AS A RESULT OF THIS PEOPLE'S DAILY LIVES HAVE BEEN CHANGING AS WELL.
FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT TODAY IT IS EASIER TO TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE NOWADAYS THERE ARE LOTS OF GOOD AND FAST MEANS OF TRANSPORT.
IN THE SAME WAY, WE CAN TRAVEL INSIDE OUR COUNTRY QUICKLY AND SAFELY.
CONSEQUENTLY, WE'VE GOT OPPORTUNITIES TO KNOW MANY DIFFERENT PLACES AND TO CONTACT DIFFERENT PEOPLE, TOO.
SECONDLY, WE CAN'T FORGET EITHER THAT ALL OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH PEOPLE BY MOBILE PHONE, BY THE INTERNET, WHO LIVE NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY, BUT ALSO ABROAD.
FINALLY, WE SHOULD CONSIDER, TOO, THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS OF HEALTH, THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON.
IN CONCLUSION, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR DAILY LIFE IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT IT WAS IN THE LAST CENTURY AND EVEN IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS CENTURY.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ARE MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
During my visit to London, I had the opportunity to visit the Circle Theatre and to see 'Over the Rainbow'.
To my dismay the musical was nothing compared to what I had expected, as it completely contradicted the advertisement.
Firstly, despite the advertisement stating that Danny Brook was starring, another actor starred in the actual show and his performance was absolutely horrible, and disappointing.
Secondly the start of the show was far from punctual.
According to the advertisement, the show which I had gone to was supposed to begin at 19:30, but the show did not start until 20:15.
In the advertisement, it said that discounts were available.
Despite this the ticket vendors explicitly told me that there were no discounts to be .
According to the advertisement, the audience were free to go to the theatre restaurant after the show.
However, by the time the show had ended the restaurant was closed.
I was further humiliated by the irony of the advertisement, which stated that it would be my 'perfect evening out', when it was quite the opposite.
I hope you understand my disappointment.
In addition, by way of compensation, I would like to have a refund, and an explanation for .
During these past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
One of the essential developments has been in our means of transportation.
The invention of cars, planes, trains and other similar forms of transportation has enabled us to go from one place to another in no time.
This enables us to save a great deal of time and effort.
Quite recently, in my country electric bicycles have been invented.
This, compared to the traditional bicycle, is less physically demanding and less time-consuming and therefore lets me travel to my destination quickly with hardly any effort at all.
This has made my life easier.
On the other hand, I feel as though I am becoming lazier and exercising less.
Another significant technological development is the invention of electrical appliances.
There are many indispensable electrical appliances, such as television, radio, fax machines, and microwaves.
What changed my life most are portal computers.
They are particularly useful for someone like me who often travels.
Before I used computers , it took so much time for me to look up words in a dictionary and look up information.
With a computer, however, all this is done in a matter of seconds.
This again enables people to save time.
Modern technology helps people in many ways and is indispensable.
However, if we rely on it too much, we could become lazy and apathetic and, as a result, will not be able to live without it once it is gone.
I am writing this letter to show how disappointed I am with the musical show "Over The Rainbow".
First of all, I was expecting to see Danny Brook acting but I felt very disappointed when a different actor appeared.
When I saw the advertisement for the show it was written that the show would start at a half past seven but it started at a quarter past eight.
Then when I was buying my ticket I asked for a discount but they weren't available.
When the show finished I was intending to visit the theatre restaurant but it was closed.
I was expecting a lovely and perfect evening out but it was the most disappointing experience I have ever had.
So because of this horrible evening I want to ask for my money back.
Modern technology has been changing human life since the first man was born.
When I wake up I take a shower using electricity then I prepare my breakfast in the oven then I go to school by bus, when I arrive at home I put my lunch in the microwave then I watch TV and do my homework using a pen.
When I come back from jiu-jitsu I eat something that was cooked in the oven then I go to bed.
About a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked their food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
Comparing these two realities the reader can notice that modern technology has changed our daily life very much.
My name is Volencia Vardez.
I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering at the shows at your theatre.
Last May, I had a week's holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL .
I was really excited about the idea of seeing that show.
First of all, when I arrived, I found a note stuck on the front door that informed me about changes to the list of performers.
Danny Brook was ill.
He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were poor.
Secondly, I want to tell you that the show started forty-five minutes late.
As to the tickets, I want to say that they are very expensive.
I had put some money aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when I went to buy them they said that discounts were not available.
To conclude, the restaurant was closed.
I would appreciate it if you could send me my money back.
Waiting for your reply.
Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
That is why she could not be a spy.
When she was a girl, Pat used to play spy and detective games.
Her mother gave her a book for her birthday about how to become a spy.
She had watched all of Mission Impossible and gadget, the inspector series.
When she finished school, she went to study at the Agent Training Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc.
She was the best student they had ever had.
But things changed during her first mission.
She was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a Trade Centre there.
You can imagine what happened to her cover .
I'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW.
According to your advertisement, it is LONDON'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW, but I was deeply disappointed with it.
According to your advertisement, the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE.
I decided to go to see this show because of its stars, but on the day I saw it, a different actor performed.
He was not DANNY BROOK.
Moreover there were no discount tickets.
They were all sold out.
You should have said there were very few.
I had to buy a £20 ticket.
To make matters worse, the .
It started at 20:15, forty-five minutes late! That's why I couldn't have dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show.
It had already closed when the show finished.
In particular, the computer has changed my daily life dramatically.
 It is only two or three years since I started using a computer at home, but now I wonder how I could live without one.
I open my mailbox every night.
When I find a new message, I'm very happy.
Before using e-mail, I used to write letters and sometimes used the telephone.
However, I've found e-mail is better than those means of communication, because as soon as I send my message, they receive it.
, I can also receive their reply quickly.
It's really useful when I need a quick reply.
Moreover when I send e-mail, I don't need to worry about the time.
I can send them anytime I like.
Thanks to modern technology, I enjoy chatting with my friends in other countries and my family in Japan almost every day.
I'm sorry to be writing to you about such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you advertised: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage! By the way, what really upset me was the starting time.
According to your advertisement it started at 19:30, and what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets.
You had promised discounts on the cost, which was from £10 to £20, but despite what I thought I had to pay £20 without any other options.
In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visiting the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me.
As I see it, the Old Man and the Sea is a really exciting book.
It describes a challenge, the challenge of life.
The main character is the old man who has to fight against the sea to stay alive.
It could be his last adventure.
This old man with his old boat goes too far away from the coast to try to fish for something good.
By surprise he comes across the biggest fish he has ever seen, a beautiful marlin.
The man keeps constantly in contact with it.
They are going to be one thing linked together.
They're fighting for the same reason with the same strength, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish.
I think they're really brothers, they feel the same pain and fear during the battle.
If the marlin could speak it would have told the old man the same thing.
When the old man won the fight he felt sorry but pleased.
He respected and still loved it.
But, afterwards, life's rule is MORS TUA VITA MEA and that's the most difficult thing to face up to.
I am writing with reference to Over the Rainbow, the musical show, which I went to see at the Circle Theatre last night.
Being a theatre lover, I am always looking forward to seeing new musicals, but unfortunately, this particular one was very disappointing.
First of all, Danny Brook was not starring, even though it was stated in your advertisement that he would perform, but the main role was played by an unknown actor.
Secondly, I had to wait for forty-five minutes for the show to start, and it was 20:15 (not 19:30) when the curtain went up.
Another disappointing thing was that I could not get a student discount, even though your advertisement promised them.
To make things even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because of the roof repairs.
As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one of my week's holiday in London.
I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to the address above.
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes.
There will be a mixture of styles from different times in the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one.
New technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colours during the day.
In the future people will be even more concerned about pollution and harmful UV-rays.
So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy.
I recently had a week's holiday in London.
During my stay, I went to the Circle Theatre to see your musical show called 'Over the rainbow'.
It was actually very disappointing and I have to say that I want my money back as you said 'your pefect evening' out in your advertisement and I really do think it was not the perfect evening out.
Here are the problems with your show.
In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not.
It was a different actor and I was very disappointed.
It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late.
The price of the ticket was another problem.
Your advertisement says 'discounts available' but it was not available.
I did not get a discount.
I really liked your idea of visiting your theatre restaurant, but because of the late start of the show, the restaurant was closed by the end of the show.
I believe that modern technology has changed a lot of people's daily life.
My daily life also has been affected by modern technology a lot.
The modern technology which changed my daily life most is the personal computer.
I can do a lot of things using the computer.
I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course work on the computer.
The main advantage of modern technology is getting more information in a shorter time.
I can go on the Internet in my house using computers or from outside using mobile phones.
I don't have to go to the library and read hundreds of books to find information anymore.
I have TV's and radios so I can watch or listen to various news and I don't have to go to football stadiums to see how the players are playing.
There are, of course, some disadvantages.
Nowadays, it is too easy to get lazy because of modern technology.
I do not have to walk or run a lot to go somewhere.
There are plenty of trains and buses.
I have to spend my time doing some exercises or I will get really lazy and unfit.
I sometimes think that it might not be a good idea to use modern technology a lot.
I spent one week in London and during my visit I had the good fortune to see "Over the rainbow" at your theatre.
But I was not very satisfied after my "perfect evening" out.
The advertisement for the Musical Show was very good, but the information was not correct.
You wrote that the main actor would be Danny Brook but there was another one who was really disappointing.
In the advertisement it was written that the show would start at 19.30 but it started 45 minutes later, at 20.15! Because of the advertisement I thought that I could get a discount on the tickets available but I couldn't.
After the show I needed to drink something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement , but it was closed.
And there was no reason why .
So you can see that it was not a so perfect an evening for me as I had expected.
Now I hope that you can understand my request for some money back because of the trouble I had.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
This was the only reason why she had not got a lot of friends.
When Pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems.
But after a few times the others would see that Pat couldn't keep secrets.
So they stopped telling her anything important almost immediately.
Sometimes it finished with the others only saying: "Hello, how are you?" And then going away without listening to the answer.
This made Pat sad and she became very quiet.
During the day she worked hard so she would not think too much.
But at night, when it became dark the dreams would come.
She dreamed about good friends, the time that had long passed by and she dreamed of someone who she could tell her own secrets.
Then one day she met this person.
It was Katha, a girl who had the same problem as Pat.
So they both found the person they dreamed of.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
If only Paul had known that before...
While he was wandering in the depths of the forest he felt a little tired and sat on a huge grey stone, on the top of which he could stare across the whole wood.
At these words, Paul suddenly awoke.
Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature into his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed.
He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat.
He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat them.
Unfortunately...one hour after that, a local zoo keeper arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage.
There she died because she did not have the Faerian food necessary for her survival.
This is how mankind destroys what is good and burns the Woods of Dream.
This is why mankind can't be relied on.
This is how secrets are betrayed, and the result .
I am writing to complain about the show, "Over the Rainbow", which I saw in your theatre last week.
I was really disappointed because the show was far from what I expected.
First of all, I was really expecting to see Danny Brook, my favourite actor.
However, he was not on the stage that day.
Secondly the show started late and I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing.
It was a waste of time.
I also thought that there should have been discounts for students, which in fact were not available and I had to pay the normal price.
Furthermore, the restaurant in the theatre was closed after the show because of the delay.
I had to go home without eating dinner, though I was really hungry.
I have to say that the evening was terrible.
If I had known , I would have changed my plan and could have had a better time.
I strongly suggest you give us the right information.
I would also like to claim a refund for the evening.
First of all, people might think more about the function of clothes than the design.
For example, they'll wear clothing which protects them from air pollution, sunshine etc.
Imagine that all the people have masks on their mouths and noses like we have sun-glasses, and that all the masks are designer brands, which are made of a special material to prevent us from breathing in polluted air.
It's like a joke, but a bit scary.
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows at the "Circle Theatre".
The show was called "Over the rainbow" and should be, to quote the advertisement, London's newest and best musical show.
But I was very disappointed.
I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook for someone else I was very disappointed.
Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should have begun at 19:30 but it started after a delay of 45 minutes.
I do not think that this delay is acceptable.
Furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student.
Even your theatre restaurant was closed for repairs.
The perfect evening you promised in your advertisement was the complete opposite and that is why I want to get some money back from you.
I am looking forward to a prompt answer.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat and I have been friends for a long time.
We have had a lot of fun together because we have the same interests.
When we were 15 years old we decided to drive my mother's car on a day when my parents were absent.
I told Pat to keep in mind that my parents would be very angry if they got to know about this.
Pat promised to tell nobody about our .
Two days later my father asked me whether I had at any time thought of driving a car without a driver's licence because he had heard about it from some parents of my friends at school.
He told me for two hours what could happen if I did that.
I was very surprised because Pat and I were alone when we decided to do it.
I felt very disappointed then but I have learned something new about humans; it is that you can only trust yourself.
Pat and I are still good friends but we have never shared another secret .
I have seen your musical show "Over the Rainbow" in London.
I was very disappointed when I read your advertisement.
I was keen on your show, but I have not seen the same show, I have seen one which looked like it, but wasn't it.
For all these reasons I wish that I had not gone to see that show, for which the tickets were not available.
And in conclusion I want you to give me my money back, (I still have the advertisement if you want proof of what I say).
You have the choice, either you do what I want, or I attack you in the courts.
When I read this book, I was fascinated by the willpower of the old fisherman.
This willpower is so amazing, he has all the elements against him.
His boat is so small and poor, he is old, it is hot and he is alone without any chance of meeting anyone who could help him.
He doesn't want help because he wants to prove to the little boy and himself that he is not really old, even if he has lived many years.
I think these are the reasons for his willpower.
Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself.
He could have triumphed over the fish because of his knowledge of the sea but it is principally because he has in the depths of his mind.
To conclude I think the most difficult situations allow us to discover ourselves ourselves.
I am writing from Paris where I live.
My wife and I spent a couple of days in London two weeks ago.
We were really pleased because it was our first time in England.
We asked our travel agent to organise our trip.
My wife and I are both fond of theatre, musicals especially.
It is so rare to see musicals in Paris that we decided to book two seats for "Over the rainbow".
We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time.
No reasons or excuses were given.
Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly from the theatre.
But, in fact, there were no discounts available.
And we had to pay £20 a seat.
The worst was to come.
The great Danny Brooks was supposed to be the main character.
But, instead of him, we saw an unknown actor (who really needs singing lessons).
So we want you to give us our money back, the show wasn't worth the price.
The first thing Pat did was to tell our young sister the secret.
And, less than five minutes later, our mother knew the whole thing.
Her reaction was not the one we were expecting.
Obviously she was not surprised, but she was certainly angry.
Really angry!! She thought it was a stupid idea, and also an expensive one.
According to her, this car would have been useless.
She suspected our father wanted to please himself.
I am writing this letter because I had a week in London last month and I decided to see your show called "Over the rainbow" with my wife and children.
We were disappointed because your advertisement was a misleading one.
First of all, the most important singer, Danny Brook, was not singing.
You should have at least informed the public because most of the people there came to see him.
However, the man who took his place gave a good performance, we enjoyed listening to him because his voice was amazing.
Finally your restaurant was closed because too few people had been coming .
I understand them.
After such a bad show you don't want to eat in the same place.
For these reasons I would like to have my money back because it was not a "perfect evening" as you said.
But I think that if you took more care of the public, your show would catch on because the singers and songs are really impressive.
The ways we travel are improving a lot at present.
Cars are really useful and a lot faster than walking or cycling.
But cars create pollution: for example the greenhouse effect.
But it is also technology which tries to resolve this problem with new means of transport such as subways or busses so as to have less cars in the cities.
Technology allows us to improve our knowledge in the sciences like medicine so as to cure more illnesses or to make people live longer.
I think there is a link between technology and the sciences because they need each other: the sciences discover technologies and technologies make new research in the sciences possible.
Technology also improved communications with the phone of course and also with the Internet.
Every evening when I come back home I go on the Internet.
I chat with other people in order to exchange our points of view or I look for information I need for my studies.
In my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionary because it's faster and you really find what you need.
Furthermore we can find everything all the time.
I am writing to you about an that I had at your last musical at the Circle Theatre.
I went to see "Over the rainbow" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening.
First of all, I was surprised that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove did not perform.
Nobody told us why they weren't there.
I am a student and I didn't get a discount ticket.
I don't understand the problem between your advertisement and the reality.
As mentioned in the newspaper, I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money.
My life changes every day because of modern technology.
For example, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I go on the Internet and ask for what I need.
The day after I get everything at home by post.
I use the Internet all the time for my homework and in the future, I hope, I will be able to use it for my own work.
I'm writing to complain about your musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW", which I recently saw at the Circle Theatre.
It was the only disappointment during my holiday in London, since several things didn't work out as promised in your advertisement.
First of all, there were no discounts available, and having paid £20 I had to wait 45 minutes longer than expected since the show began at 20:15 and not at 19:30.
As a second point, the actor was not Danny Brook, as advertised, but someone else I've never heard of before.
His acting and singing were horrible.
Finally, after all these disappointments, I was not able to have dinner in your theatre restaurant.
It was closed for some reason I still don't know.
You see, it was not the "perfect evening out", as you had promised in the advertisement.
Therefore, I would like to ask for at least half of my money back.
Pat was a teacher of English as a foreign language.
Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have revised for it in advance.
And always, everybody did it surprisingly well.
What was the reason? Pat used to show the test to his friend Nick, when he had finished it, to get his opinion.
Nick then took a copy of the test to file it.
And Nick's girlfriend happened to be in Pat's class.
She was quite clever and had known everything about this, so she had made copies for her classmates and everybody was prepared.
It wasn't the first time I saw this show in your theatre, but it was the worst one.
At first it was a great pleasure for me to get a ticket because I'm one of Danny Brook's greatest fans.
It's not that .
When the musical started at 20:15 (not at 19:30 as advertised) I was really shocked when I realised that a different actor was playing his role.
I couldn't stay any longer and had to leave the theatre.
You have to know that I am very sick because of my blood pressure and so I was laying down the whole weekend.
In my opinion it's simple for you to pay me back the money I spent.
Otherwise I have to contact my lawyer.
I am waiting to hear from you.
For me, as a scientist, it's a big problem to show how the innovations of the last century the environment and nature.
In the past new technologies were mostly followed by ground-, water- or air pollution.
Nowadays a simple thing like a computer includes so many possible ways of destroying different .
On the one hand there are the materials from which the PCs are made , on the other hand is the huge waste problem .
Now I try to show, in my daily work, how the airborn chlororganics, which are from plastics, will be separated and damaged by green plants.
Sometimes it seems to me like a joke if I think about all the dangerous materials I need to do my job.
Nevertheless, in my opinion, the only way to find a better way of living with nature is to check out the problems we have.
Therefore it makes sense to use the innovations which are causing environmental destruction.
A few days ago I went to your theatre to see a musical show.
Unfortunately I was very disappointed with it; I was expecting the opposite.
First of all, the advertisement where you advertised your show and what the theatre provides is totally wrong.
So, after all of that, I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant.
I was very angry when I appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
In fact I am writing to you with just one main aim.
I'll be really delighted to receive the money back for my ticket.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
Begin at the beginning.
Look at the history books for 400-600 years ago, or even for the time of the First and Second World Wars, to see how society has changed, just because we stepped up the advance of science and technology.
On the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
I think this because before the effect on our health was less than it is now.
More and more people die from some illnesses whereas a long time ago fewer people died from the same illnesses, despite the fact that they had fewer medicines.
However, technology nowadays has improved so much and it has changed our lives a lot.
Today we can't even think how we could possibly live without computers or without aeroplanes.
The computer is our way of communicating with the outside world, whereas with aeroplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains.
Every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and that is good.
It has to be like that, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
Society has to go forward not to stop in one place.
I am writing to complain about a musical I went to one week ago.
Firstly, I was really disappointed when I realised that the actor Danny Brook was not performing for personal reasons.
I like this actor very much and it was not the same without him.
Moreover, the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it started at 20:15, making all the audience wait for nearly an hour.
To make matters worse, there were no discounts on tickets such as you advertised.
Because of this I had to buy a ticket for the cheapest and worst seat available.
As if this were not enough, once the show ended I had to walk twenty blocks to find a Restaurant since the theatre Restaurant was closed for maintenance.
I, therefore, request an immediate refund of the £10 I spent on your musical as I believe your theatre is directly to blame.
Everything started when I was eight years old and my family bought a Personal Computer.
I didn't pay attention to it then but as as I grew older I started to like and play Computer games.
The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing homework and in the evening learning with my Computer.
In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk to them, I kept on, stuck in front of the screen.
Nowadays it is a fact that my life wouldn't be the same without my PC.
After I got connected to the Internet my life completely changed.
I spend my free time building my Personal Web Page with which I intend to earn money in the future; and I also check the weather forecast, buy food and pay bills through the web.
My daily life would be harder without modern technology.
I'm terribly sorry but I have to inform you about a very disappointing evening.
I'm sure you'll read this letter with the intention of explaining the problems I had during the musical show at your theatre.
One of the causes of my disappointment was the substitute actor that played in the show.
I like Danny Brook very much, and his unexpected absence caused me great sadness.
Then, the musical show had to start at 19,30..why was the light on at 20:15? You'll agree with me that 45 minutes waiting for the start of the show is too long a time.
The advertisement for the show indicated discounts available and an open restaurant after the show but it wasn't like that.
The restaurant was closed because of illness..
whose? It's a strange thing! For those reasons I ask you for some money back, sure of my good reasons.
It's for this reason that I'm now in this terrible situation.
I can't believe she said that I was at Maria's party and, because I was distracted, I told Pat that I had lost Jon's shirt.
I had agreed to buy another one, of the same style, but now he's angry with me, because I didn't say anything to him.
I don't know what to do.
He's my best friend and so he wanted all the truth from me I could give him.
It's all right, but I also think that he's exaggerating.
I don't think I have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendship.
I feel sad and shocked.
I like his company, and we are happy when we are together.
I can't finish with him because of a girl who can't keep a simple secret.
AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE FULL PRICE.
MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I INTENDED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT.
FINALLY, YOU PROMISED IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT WAS NOT SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.
FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS.
BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPS; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) DESIGNERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE THE OPPOSITE OF ANOTHER.
I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE NOW, OR A MORE FANTASTIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT.
SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV.
AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON COMFORT MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE.
BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATEGORY.
I'M WRITING TO YOU BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK, WHEN I WENT TO THE CIRCLE THEATRE AND I SAW "OVER THE RAINBOW".
IT WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTING.
FIRST OF ALL, IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT YOU SAID THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT I COULDN'T FIND THEM AVAILABLE ANYWHERE.
SECONDLY...THE PLAY STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT: FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATE.
WHEN IT STARTED I COULD SEE THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T IN THE PLAY, AND NOBODY TOLD US WHY.
THE ACTOR WHO WAS ACTING HIS PART IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN, REALLY TERRIBLE.
HAD HE BEEN IN A PLAY BEFORE? I DON'T THINK SO....
FINALLY, WHEN THE PLAY FINISHED, WE WENT TO THE THEATRE RESTAURANT TO HAVE DINNER BUT IT WAS CLOSED.
I DON'T KNOW THE REASON WHY...
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WASN'T A "PERFECT EVENING".
I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME A FULL REFUND.
MY ADDRESS IS IN THE ENVELOPE.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS....AND WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT MARIA WAS GOING OUT WITH TIM (A CLASSMATE), SHE TOLD EVERYONE SHE MET.
WITHIN A FEW DAYS MARIA'S FATHER (WHO IS VERY JEALOUS) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR.
HE ASKED MARIA IF IT WAS TRUE AND SHE COULDN'T LIE.
HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA TO GO OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS.
MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
MARIA MET TIM AT NIGHT, WHEN HER FATHER WAS SLEEPING.
WHEN MARIA COULD GO OUT SHE TOLD HER FRIENDS WHAT PAT HAD DONE.
NOW NOBODY TELLS HER ANYTHING.
MARIA IS STILL GOING OUT WITH TIM.
HER FATHER ACCEPTED HIM AFTER A WHILE.
I recently had a holiday in London and went to your musical show 'Over the Rainbow' but found it very disappointing.
It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
However, there was a different, unknown actor in that.
The show started late, at 20:15, which was very different from '19.30' .
There was no discount at all, which was in contrast with 'Discounts Available'.
After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed for no reason.
The real show is really very different to what is described in the advertisement.
I am unsatisfied and would like to ask for some money back.
Please would you also change the advertisement the actual facts.
The fashion in clothing just keeps on changing.
Although some may appear again after a few years, different styles are developed.
Concerning the fashion of the future, I think it depends on people's personalities and they develop their own styles which suit them the most.
They can wear different kinds of clothing, .
For the colours, I think metallic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular.
As different kinds of fabrics .
Maybe paper can also be a fabric used to make clothing and for those who like to wear new clothes every day.
They can be thrown away after wearing them and are light enough to be carried around whenever you want to change what you're wearing.
First of all, I am a fan of Danny Brook but he was absent because he was sick.
It disappointed me very much.
Moreover, he made many mistakes.
Secondly, although we had booked the tickets 3 days before we went to the theatre, we could not be given any discounts only because we had booked at a travel agency.
Finally, I am going to write about the theatre, the Circle Theatre.
The show was supposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
Because of that, we missed the train and we had to stay one more night in London.
It was your fault.
We would like you to return the price of the ticket and pay us for that hotel as well.
I would recommend you that the restaurant is closed on Monday.
I could not have dinner.
If you asked the young people what they spend their money on most, most of them would answer 'clothes'.
These days, new fashions very quickly.
In my opinion, young people tend to wear clothes which can show their skin.
For example, short skirts and tops like underwear.
I think young people which make them look like they are almost naked even in winter.
I suppose that a scientist could invent new kinds of materials which are warm and thick.
It could be that people will wear the clothes which ancient people used to wear, like skirts made of leaves.
Next, I predict .
The is catching on now.
It might be possible that the will catch on in 100 years.
Last week, I went to London, to your theatre to see "Over the rainbow" and I had a disappointing evening.
The problems were: firstly, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there in your show, I was unhappy to that there were different actors that evening.
Secondly, the 19:30 show only started at 20:15; thirdly, your advertisement said: "Discounts available"; but it wasn't the case.
Fourth, the restaurant was closed for renovation and you shouldn't have proposed we go.
As you can see, I'm very disappointed about this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money.
That's why I ask you to give me my money back.
I ask you to give me £20, back by cheque.
Technology is the future, and the present.
For instance, the Internet.
The whole world is now connected by it.
The Internet is the "new" revolution of communications and knowledge.
The Internet has existed for ten years now, but we only used to use it for army and government purposes.
Now, everybody who works in a commercial company uses the Internet every day.
Technology also means all electrical machines, which don't stop being developed.
Another example, computers, every six months something better is invented.
Modern technology has changed my daily life every day.
For instance, meat - we don't cook our meals, everything is already done.
Five minutes in the microwave and it's ready.
Machines have replaced the work of humans.
Every day we use technological machines without knowing.
Our whole life is being simplified by machines .
I'm writing to you inform you about the disappointing evening I had when I went to your theatre to see the play called "OVER THE RAINBOW".
According to the advertisement you published, there should have been some important differences to the production I saw.
Secondly, in the advertisement it said that discounts were available but there was no discount on the tickets I bought.
Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there were on holiday.
In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I have had and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refund for part of the money I wasted there.
I would be grateful if you could do that.
Finally, I want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat your customers.
If you do that, there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them.
Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have.
It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it.
In this instance we are going to focus on me: Emilio Almodar, 18 years old, University Student, and the career I have chosen is in International Commerce or .
I use technology every minute but I did not realise.
For example, when I come back home from university and I call my friends, I am using it because at home we have very modern phones and a fax machine and almost everybody in my family has a cellular phone and things like that.
We also have five computers, the latest models, because they are useful for my father to work on and for me to do some special projects for University.
These machines are connected to the Internet, and that gives my family too much access to all the information we want, from how to prepare a drink to what was the result of Sunday's football match.
In addition to this we use the net to communicate with some friends we have in the U.S.A.
It's really amazing.
Apart from this, I don't spent my free time using technology.
I prefer playing rugby and going out with friends, because technology is not all of life, but it is only a little part of it.
I recently had the opportunity to see "over the rainbow", which was performed last week in the Circle theatre.
I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I had there.
Actually, I read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.
In fact, Danny Brook didn't perform or appear on stage last Tuesday, his role was played by another - a quite bad - actor, less famous than Danny Brook.
I'm also annoyed because I had to wait 45 minutes before the play started.
I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had.
I was in London with some friends (we are students) and no discount was offered or given to us.
We had to pay £15 each to see a miserable play.
After the play, we wanted to eat at the theatre restaurant but we couldn't.
It was apparently closed and I'm asking you why.
As you can see, there are some (deliberate?) mistakes in the advertisement you made.
We didn't have a "perfect evening out" at all.
That's why I'm asking you to give us our money back.
I had a strange feeling then because it was just amazing to see how money can attract so many people.
Actually, Pat would still remain my best friend, even if he failed me.
It's not easy to keep such an enormous secret and I couldn't keep it inside me.
I quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention they gave me.
They didn't stop giving me advice or telling me what to do with my money.
I always have been involved in many different associations, which are fighting against AIDS or cancer.
I knew at this moment exactly what to do and, finally, I could recover my ordinary life as an unpopular student.
I am writing to ask about your advertisement and theatre show.
I am a student in Liverpool, and recently I had a week's holiday in London.
On my first day in London, I saw your advertisement which was very interesting to me.
But I was really disappointed by it.
First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement.
Also, it was certain for me to be able to buy a discount ticket because I am a student.
But, it was not possible.
Second, I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening.
However, the show started 45 minutes later.
I wasted too much time waiting.
It was not good for me, because I had only one weeks holiday in London.
Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed with the word "Staff vacation" on the front door after the show.
It was totally different from your leaflet.
On the whole, I was really disappointed at that time.
Could you give me half of my money back? I enclose my phone number and address.
I think the people will wear convenient clothes with a simple design in the future.
Because the people will stay at home more than now with their computer.
And they will use soft cozy fabrics like cotton and silk.
However, if they have some special day like an important public day or special day of their life, they will wear very different kinds of clothes which you have never seen before.
Some of that will be very strange to our eyes, but some of the others will be familiar to us.
And they will use most kinds of things Maybe some people will be naked.
There are too many negative points for one evening.
I am afraid that I want my money back.
I hope you do not disappoint me on this point.
'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a taboo subject with me and my friends.
We have discussed it a lot of times.
I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future.
I had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different.
I think it is very difficult to change clothes and fashion so much again.
We have so many kinds of clothes and fashions from our old generations.
Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes more modern so that you cannot walk in them anymore.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow" that has been performed in the Circle Theatre.
As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre on my last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with it.
First of all, I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there.
For example, the actors that were announced as taking part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and, the principal point: it started forty-five minutes late.
Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed.
I wonder if you could explain to me why.
Due to my huge dissatisfaction, I would like my money back, as you do not provide what was advertised.
Every day, the growth of modern technology increases in the whole world and it is becoming essential in everybody's life.
Today, almost no one can live without, for example, a television, a radio or electricity in their homes.
The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good things into my life, like the potential to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image on my cab TV and on my computer.
Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet.
On the other hand, the excess of convenience can lead us, in the future, to a completely "cold" world, because of the distance that can be created between people.
Other bad points can be mentioned, like pollution for example.
Despite the bad things that modern technology can bring, in my opinion, if the governments tried to do their best, and if everybody contributed a little bit, we could solve the main problems and only take advantage of the benefits to our lives.
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show, where everything was completely different from the advertisement.
Firstly, I would like to say that I am very disappointed and upset with the show I saw.
To begin my complaint I might start with the actor - who was a different one to the one advertised, not Danny Brook.
Tina Truelove performed marvellously, but him, I think he is a "street actor" from Covent Garden.
Even worse was the delay.
The Show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, which drove me mad.
I am a student visiting London for one week only and I asked for a discount ticket.
I could not get it, it was really unfair.
I paid the normal price.
Also there was another problem.
I planned to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show, I could not, it was closed because it was being refurbished and redecorated.
Anyway, I expected to have a perfect evening out, however, I just had a terrible time, everything went wrong.
The only thing to do is: to compensate me, send me my money back.
I am sending my ticket for that.
Hope you'll be fair with me otherwise I am going to take this further.
The twenty-first century - technology, technology, and technology.
Modern life has been full of science and technology.
I am very pleased that I was born in a time when there is such good technology but my parents didn't have the same luck.
My life is much easier with all this stuff mentioned above - technology and science.
Computers have changed people's lives.
Many of them can work from home, they don't need to go to their offices.
The Internet is very handy, you can shop, send e-mail messages, or even have sex, which is really funny.
There is an ambiguity about technology - it can create good things and terrible things as well.
One good side is it makes life easier - computers, mobile phones, vending machines, etc....
The bad side is we can use technology for war - missiles, weapons, etc....
Indeed technology has changed our lives, we have become more sceptical and cold.
I believe that people should take .
Sometimes I think technology is not a good thing....
I have recently been to London on holiday so I decided to spend my free time going to the musical show you were advertising .
It seemed very attractive and the information on the ad pushed me into going to it.
As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influences me is through my work: the Internet has become such an incredible tool, I can research into everything I want, find information for lectures, for example, or exercises.
The internet is really the widest source of knowledge.
Nevertheless, new technology has made me more lazy.
I spend a lot of my free time watching TV, or surfing on the Internet or playing on the computer.
Maybe it will change me into a kind of self-centred person, a loner.
But the positive way new technology has changed my life is in the way I communicate.
It made it possible to discover, to talk with new people on the Internet but also to join and to be joined by my friends or parent.
I can send e-mails or use the mobile phone.
But we should not forget that they are only tools and should emphasise human relationships.
I have recently spent a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain about a couple of things.
First, I would like to complain about the main , which is an actor.
He might be well known in England, but on the night, he performed abysmally.
Secondly, a lot of people were not very impressed with the delay, because all of us had to wait for almost an hour before the show started.
Also, a lot of people were about the facilities, which were said to be in the advertisement.
For example, the discount for the tickets was not available, and in particular a lot of people were disappointed that they couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed, due to the cleaner forgetting to clean up the mess from the previous party.
Lastly, I do not think I would call this my perfect evening, so I would like to ask for a refund, and I hope as the Manager of London's newest theatre, you will handle the situation .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Although he's one of my best friends, sometimes, he's a real pain in the butt.
Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I have always got on very well.
We always go to the same school, and he often makes more friends than I do, and every time he introduces me to them.
Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone, even himself.
Although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when Pat and I had a fight.
It all started when once I accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside.
I was so nervous and embarrassed, so I told Pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
So that's when we had a fight.
Anyway, Pat eventually apologized to me and we are still best mates as ever.
Firstly, there was a different actor/actress whose name I have never heard before.
Even though they performed their parts excellently I was very disappointed about your incorrect advertisement.
Secondly, the musical was not started on time.
It was going to start at 19.30.
However, It was started 45 minutes later.
, I missed my return train after the show.
Thirdly, there was no discount on my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired.
Finally, it was a perfectly terrible evening out.
So, I want you to give me my money back.
If you don't do that, I will tell the public that you are wrong in your advertisement.
Yours sincerely.
When I was a young child, I used to be interested in reading science fiction.
Interestingly, nowadays, I live in the scientific world which I read about in the books.
Probably, I started using a mobile phone 5 years ago.
Before using a mobile-phone, if someone wanted to talk to me immediately, they couldn't find where I was.
However, nowadays, it is easy to find me because of the mobile phone.
I used to write a letter to my friends.
However, after the appearance of the Internet, I send e-mail to my friends.
It takes just a few minutes to send e-mail to someone.
I just check my e-mail before going to bed every day.
In conclusion, because of modern technology, I'm very comfortable and can do something efficiently with my computer and mobile phone.
I am writing to complain about a musical show last weekend when I was in London.
To be honest, I would like you to return the money to me.
And explain what had happened.
I look forward to hearing from you .
Thank you for your .
Lily was one of her best friends for three years.
She enjoyed sharing everything with Pat, whatever it was.
Nick was Lily's husband.
Her husband had been fired the previous year.
Lily felt very nervous about their financial problems and their future as they wanted to have a baby.
She told Pat about what had happened in her family and that she was worried.
Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other people about his private .
She told Pat that she didn't want any other people to know about it except her.
Pat also promised not to tell other people.
But at a party, their friends wanted to show their concern, and they went to ask about Nick and give him their sympathy.
This made Nick very embarrassed and he felt hurt.
Finally, they got separated.
Today, Pat and Lily are still friends.
But Lily never tells her what she really wants and what she really thinks about things.
Pat felt very sorry about that but it was too late.
I am writing to you, because I would like to disagree with your advertisement for the show 'over the Rainbow'.
I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening at your theatre.
At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was a totally different actor.
As it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because according to the programme it started at 20.15, but that is not the end of the story; in your advertisement it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets.
That was not true! I was still not very disappointed, because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant, which I could have according to your advertisement, but what I did not realise, it was closed, because the chef was in hospital.
I did not have a perfect evening at all and I would like to ask you to return my money .
Every day we keep in touch via technology.
We have microwaves that help us to make our meals quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that make our lives easier.
I use different technological things every day.
Such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if I am not at home; I use a stereo if I want to listen to my favourite music; I use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
I think that all these things have made my life much easier.
Many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot.
I am very happy that with all the technology that we have we don't have to work as much as they did, doing things like washing plates and cups after meals.
My dishwasher will do that for me, and I don't have to wash my clothes, my washing machine does it better.
Of course it is a bit sad that machinery is taking over from humans and of course it makes me lazy.
However, now I have more freedom, free time, and privacy.
In fact, some days before Karin, a friend of hers, had told Pat that she had fallen in love with John, her science teacher.
Pat was astonished, and didn't know what (she) should tell Karla.
So she decided to tell Hill the whole story.
Hill liked Pat very much, but only as a friend.
He was 19 (years old), so Pat thought that he would know what was the best thing to do.
But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousin.
They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream.
So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they knew her feelings for Mr.
Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything ever.
I am writing to you to complain about the dreadful evening I had when I went to see your show at the Circle Theatre on the 9th June.
To start with, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't perform as advertised.
They were replaced by some unknown actors who had certainly never performed in a musical.
If I had only one reason to ask you for my money back; it would be this.
But to add to this I had to join a long queue to get a full-price ticket when I had brought my student card for the purpose of getting the discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist.
The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore I and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed for sanitary reasons.
For this disappointment and your inaccurate advertisement and for all the given reasons, I ask you for a refund of five pounds per ticket.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
This trait didn't allow you to tell him much about yourself.
He wasn't really wicked, he merely didn't understand when to keep his mouth shut, especially at school where every little unimportant thing about your so-called "private life" runs three laps around the schoolyard before you learn it although you are the most concerned about it and didn't even know.
Well, some people just don't care, some are bothered and feel ill at ease.
But a small drama can grow out of proportion as children are very sensitive.
There is one point I want to make clear, I don't begrudge Pat anything.
I believe this is a rule of society, it's a sort of group behaviour, and belongs to childhood and the teenage years.
We all speak or have spoken of our neighbours, family, classmates, workmates, friends in bad terms.
That is only human.
In my opinion what is more regrettable is when we grown-ups continue this bad habit.
The critical spirit has to be preserved but we must keep our secrets.
What allows us to reveal parts of someone else's private life? Nothing.
Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show "Over the Rainbow", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, as its advertisement promises us.
Unfortunately, I had a terrible evening.
At first I became worried because there weren't any discounts available, though your advertisement says there are.
And I became even more angry when I had to wait 45 minutes for the show to begin.
It's necessary to start on time, and your had informed us that it would begin at 19:30.
It didn't happen.
To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I'd never heard anything about, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement has.
I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back.
It isn't fair not returning the money to a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a disgrace.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
And because of that, everyone at school got to know that Ali was dating Nick, who was Caroline's boyfriend at the time.
Pat was Ali's best friend, and because of that, Ali told her that she was going out with Caroline's boyfriend, but asked her to keep it secret.
One week later, everyone at school started to laugh at Caroline and look down on Ali and Nick.
Caroline discovered everything, and argued with the unfaithful couple.
It was a big quarrel, people that were many metres away could hear it.
Pat entered the fight, and it became more loud and aggressive.
One more week passed, and things became calm: Ali decided never to look Pat in the eye anymore.
They have become  big enemies.
And Nick told her that his real love was his girlfriend Caroline, and that they weren't going to break up.
Poor Ali..
So, it's very important to be a person who can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one.
One of the most beautiful things in the world is true and loyal friendship.
Then, we have to be the best secret keepers possible, or we will end up like Ali and Pat.
I'm writing this letter to complain about a musical show which I saw last Saturday.
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show.
I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to have a drink before I went to the hall so I got there earlier.
The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
It was about fourty five minutes later than the original starting time.
I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset at that time.
The thing which made me really upset was the actor.
The actor should have been Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before.
I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention that that actor was going to be changed to another man.
This thing shouldn't have happened.
After I finished watching the show I went to the restaurant which you advertised.
It was about 21:00, I thought it was a bit later but it wasn't my fault anyway.
The show was finished at 21:00.
When I went there the restaurant was closed.
We couldn't even get any sandwiches.
I'm too upset to say anything anymore and I want to get my money back which I paid for the show.
I look forward to hearing from you before I .
Nowadays, we have millions of styles of fashion and every single person has their own fashion.
Fashion has become a part of our life and some people think that what clothes you wear is the most important thing.
We spend lots of time choosing clothes or shoes.
 100 years ago, people dressed  differently.
Women wore dresses and men wore suits in England.
It was very formal fashion, but now people wear more sexy clothes than 100 years ago.
Fashion keeps changing.
Therefore, in the future fashion might be changed a lot.
I think people will wear metal clothes like in Robotcap.
The environment will be very polluted and finally we'll get diseases.
We will need helmets to cover our heads and we will also need .
Maybe, science will be developed and make our environment clean, and we will not wear anything at all!!! (except underwear).
I hope that the environment will be better than now in the future and our fashion will be changed but nobody knows how it will be.
We should try hard to create new fashion and suitable fashion in future times.
The advertisement promised there would be my favourite star, Danny Brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny Brook.
In addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
Moreover, when I was buying our tickets, there weren't any discounts in spite of the fact that my wife and I are both on a pension.
As a result, our evening was completely spoiled.
So I am sure you will understand why I am so annoyed and frustrated with the whole incident.
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future to offer me a partial refund.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Two days before, her best friend Maria told her that her parents were going to divorce.
Maria was so upset that she couldn't keep it to herself.
Her father had met another woman who was not as pretty as Maria's mother but worked in a bank and had a good salary.
One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter.
All her father's things were missing.
They could not believe their eyes.
They read the letter and slowly went into the kitchen.
Maria had bought his favourite food and she threw it into the bin.
How could he have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years.
They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot.
Now everything was over.
She went to school, but she could not follow the lessons as easily as she used to.
So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat.
She was so understanding.
Now everyone knows about her sad story and that makes her feel even worse.
I am writing to complain about your music show entitled "Over the Rainbow", which I saw during my holiday in London.
Firstly, I expected to see a performance by Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor.
However, without any announcement, a different actor was playing his role.
Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed for maintenance.
You should have let us have that information in advance.
Finally, although I heard a student discount ticket was available, the ticket salesman said I should have bought one at least one day before the show.
I was not satisfied with your show at all.
Therefore, I think you should pay me some money back.
Please let me know what you think of my complaint and request as soon as possible.
I think modern technology has changed my daily life, especially when it comes to communication with my best friend, who is studying in Britain.
We saw each other once a week before she left Japan for Britain.
I used to think I would miss her.
But now I can communicate with her every day by e-mail.
Furthermore, we can talk on the phone.
as if I was speaking with a friend in Japan.
Without a computer and a telephone, I couldn't contact her easily and I might lose touch with her.
In addition, I can go to Britain by plane to see her.
Before the plane was invented, I suppose it might have taken several months to visit Britain by ship.
At present, it takes just 12 hours by plane.
Thanks to such modern technology, I can improve my relationship with my friend, even if she is living far away from me.
I am writing this letter to remind you of some faults of your theatre.
I think this will help your organization to improve itself.
From my point of view, your organisation has to be careful .
Last week I was in London.
I attended your .
I'm sorry but I didn't have a good of your when I left.
I know the quality of your organization.
That's why I wanted to write to you.
The first time, when I saw the advertisement in the newspaper, I really .
I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible.
.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
But Beatrice didn't think so.
That's why she so many problems.
They were best friends.
Beatrice thought so.
When she came to school, at first, we wanted to warn her.
On the other hand Beatrice and her family were our next-door neighbours.
I knew her family better than everyone else.
Her father never let her have a boyfriend.
Yes, it was strange behaviour.
Beatrice was 18 and she could manage.
But her father didn't have the same opinion.
That's all I knew about her.
I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment with your theatre.
In the advertisement that I received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept waiting for it to start for half an hour.
And there were no discounts available either, unlike what was written in the same advertisement.
Another disappointing point was that I wanted to see Danny Brook so much and it was written that he was acting in the show, but unfortunately the man on the stage was not him.
And the actor's performance was terrible.
Because of all these reasons, which I have listed above, my evening, which should have been perfect, turned into a disaster.
So I would like to have at least some of my money back as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
And now the situation was becoming harder to put up with.
On the one hand it was her best friend who wanted her to keep this secret.
But on the other hand it was her best friend's family that she must lie to.
Her best friend was going out with a boy that night, and she had told her parents that she was going to stay at Pat's house, in order to get permission.
So Pat could not decide what to do.
She did not trust the boy, and it was very hard for her to lie to people that she liked so much.
And she realized that if something happened to her best friend, it would be her fault and her best friend's parents would blame her for it.
She knew she would be very sorry too.
I am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theatre that I watched a week ago, during my stay in London.
That evening, the problems started with the tickets...
Unlike what was stated in the advertisement that was published in the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International Student's Identity Card.
Secondly, the show started after a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed.
Another problem was the male actor : the well-known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the theatre restaurant, which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show, but it was closed.
So, I did not have the "perfect evening out" as stated in your advertisement.
I think you owe me an apology and a full refund.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
Do we ever see a naked person in the streets? Except in some very extraordinary cases, no.
Tell me, why do people care so much about what they wear and what others wear? Because clothes play a crucial part in our everyday lives.
In my opinion the clothes of the world, in a century's time, will be styled in a Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist.
Throughout history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be "out".
Of course, technology will change too.
Maybe new kinds of fabrics that are capable of insulating light or heat will be used.
Actually, some clothes like that are being developed today, but only as prototypes and it is possible to see that they will be widely used in the future.
Finally, it seems to me that the clothes of tomorrow will be quite naturalistic and minimalist and also, the fabrics that are used will change too.
In fact, we cannot know what time will give and take away, so let's wait and see the clothes of the future.
I'm writing to tell you about a great book I've just finished reading, and which I'm sure you would like to read too.
Its name is "Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie", and I really was impressed with the coherence of the stories.
Agatha Christie presents situations that .
The crimes she describes seem so perfect that we think a lot trying to find out who is the criminal.
I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place on a Detective course.
I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study.
Agatha Christie's stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent.
It's stimulating to read them.
One of the stories will be read on the radio next week.
I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are many challenges in your new career.
I am writing this letter to you to point out the difference between your advertisement for Over The Rainbow and what happened in real life.
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you wrote in your advertisement.
But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time.
I am a fan of Danny Brook and he was one of the reasons why I chose to see Over The Rainbow, but I didn't even see him on the stage.
Moreover it was written in the advertisement that the musical was between 14.30 and 18.30.
Surprisingly the show started at 20:15.
That destroyed all my plans.
Then I decided to have dinner at your Theatre Restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed.
I think all of these disappointments are too much for one evening.
All in all I am sure that you have understood it wasn't my perfect evening out and you will give me my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
That was also my fault.
I don't know why I told Pat this.
But I thought Pat and I were best friends.
Yesterday Larry suggested going to the cinema after school.
This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had.
Going to the cinema with the boy I love.
It sounded really good.
Of course I accepted immediately.
I was walking in the clouds for the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me.
I suddenly remembered that I had promised Pat that I would help her with her history homework.
She came up to me and said "Ready for this evening? Don't forget to bring your history books." She was very nervous because she was about to fail.
I told her that I wanted to tell her something.
Then I explained what had happened that morning.
She was going to cry.
"I see.
You are choosing Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend." After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry.
I told her not to tell anyone this.
She said OK angrily.
After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home.
When they asked me the reason I told them that I promised my Mom to stay in with her.
They said OK and I went home.
When I closed my bedroom door I burst into tears.
I don't know how long I cried...
Next morning I went to school again.
Everyone at the school knew about my love for Larry including him.
Pat was the only person who had known about it.
Two weeks ago, I came to London for a week's holiday.
During my stay in your city, I had the opportunity to attend your show named 'Over the rainbow' after having read an advertisement in the magazine 'Going-out', the 1st of June issue.
I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show.
The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6-year-old son had to pay the full price.
Then, even if we could enter the theatre, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expected.
Indeed, we are still waiting for Danny Brook who was not in the play.
And last, at the end of the performance, we would have liked to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.
As this evening was for my family and a wasted one, I permit myself to ask you for a refund.
You don't have to be a genius to notice that technology has evolved so considerably during the last few decades that our everyday life has changed.
From my point of view, modern technology has permitted me to find a job as I work as a computer engineer.
In this domain, you have to , every day, the development of new technology.
And as new discoveries bring new discoveries, progress is going faster and faster.
The advantage of this is that you need to take an interest in everything if you don't want to be left on the shelf.
And so, your life is not boring at all as you learn new things every day.
On the other hand, you cannot rest for 2 weeks as some new inventions come out every day.
I am writing to you because of the musical show, "Over The Rainbow", I saw in your theatre last week.
I looked forward to a perfect evening but it was the most disappointing one I have ever had.
Firstly, you did not tell the truth about the lead.
The advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook.
Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor who I do not like and if I had known that he was going to be there I would not have gone to see him.
Secondly, it was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15.
Forty-five minutes later! You also had mentioned about the discounts and there were not any.
Keeping in mind all these complaints, I want to ask you for some money back.
I think it could be your nice apology for all my problems and disappointments.
Modern technology is a very important aspect of our lives.
It is always with us: in our homes, in the places we work and learn.
It affects our lives - mine too.
In fact, modern technology was already very popular and commonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life suddenly.
But I am also sure that my life would be different without it.
All these products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day.
For example, I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water.
Next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio.
All these things are the results of technology.
On the other hand, I am aware of all the disadvantages of modern technology; pollution and the dangers it brings.
But I think it has more advantages than disadvantages and it is O.K.
I am really glad that I am a child of my century - the age of modern science.
Finally, I think that we cannot talk only about the changes which modern technology has brought to our lives.
That's because I think that we are the ones who change the technology as well.
I think that our lives are lives with technology.
They sometimes .
So how has modern technology changed my daily life? I don't know what it would be like without the technology.
I am writing to complain about a musical show on the 10th of June, and I was very disappointed.
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw another star that was completely different from your brochure.
To make the matter worse, I had travelled to London to see this famous star but I didn't see any shows with him.
It makes me a bit angry.
According to your brochure, the show would start at 19.30 p.m.
but it started at 20.15 p.m.
I wanted to sleep and it was very annoying.
More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any discount.
I had to pay full price.
I was promised that after the show I could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late, therefore, when I went to the restaurant they were closed.
I was very hungry and tired.
You said that it was a perfect evening out but it wasn't like that.
I would like you to refund some of my money .
I paid £ 50.00 for the show.
I also have a receipt to prove it.
I would like you to give my money back as soon as possible.
I have a really good friend, Pat who I trusted and counted on .
I have known her for five years.
And we loved each other very much.
One day, I fell in love with my closest friend.
I went out with him sometimes and we were happy.
My boyfriend was very handsome, clever and very polite.
We were studying in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well.
Personally, I wanted to keep it secret because I was afraid that we might split up.
And I would like to make sure that he really loved me.
My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came.
To be honest, I wanted to share this feeling with someone else but I needed to keep it very secret.
I felt unhappy sometimes.
One day I decided to tell my best friend - Pat, who I relied on .
I told her everything about my boyfriend and when we met each other and eventually fell in love.
After I told her I felt my feeling had been released and I was happy.
I also told her to keep it very secretand not tell anyone in the class.
On Monday morning, I walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend.
I was very embarrassed and I wanted to run out of the class.
I felt very angry with Pat and I shouldn't have told her about my boyfriend.
I felt regret but it was too late.
It wasn't a secret anymore now.
My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am writing to let you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical at the London theatre.
I decided to see the 19:30 show so I arrived on time at 19:00 o'clock.
I went to buy a ticket and as I like to enjoy the show near the stage I bought a £20 ticket but when I asked for a discount they told me, "I am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement.
It will be impossible to give you a discount".
This was my first problem.
At 19:15 I was very impatient, waiting for the show to begin, and a man announced that the show would start at 20:15.
I had to wait more that an hour outside the theatre because to make matters worse I couldn't spend the time in the theatre restaurant.
The reason they gave me was it was closed because it was being repaired.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It would have been the best party of the year.
Last month was my grandmother's birthday and I organised a party for her.
My grandmother loves parties and when she was young she used to organise big parties for all her family and friends.
Now she is 85 years old so she can't do that but I can.
I organised everything like: the place, the food, the decoration.
I sent letters by post to everybody she knows.
It seemed likely to be the biggest party of her life.
I thought we could put on a show at this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend, to see if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V.
programmes.
She loved the idea and said she had various shows so I could decide which would be the most suitable.
I told her to call me .
Pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
But the party was great after all.
A few weeks ago, my family and I had a holiday in London.
The holiday wasn't too good, because...
During the week we decided where we wanted to go.
We all agreed to listen to music so then we decided to go to your musical show and listen to "Over the Rainbow".
That evening we didn't want to have our supper before the show.
Anyway I thought it would be too early to eat and also : "visit our theatre restaurant after the show".
So we did, but unfortunately it was closed and I was so disappointed about it, not only because we had expected Danny Brook and Tina Truelove to .
Also I don't really mind that the show started late but the rucented.
And there were no discounts when you said there would be! Why is it everything that was wrong and different from what we experienced.
We don't expect to happen on our holiday, but this was , it was the worst show and theatre I have ever been to in my life.
To help us to live happily, scientists can easily predict , so that we can have time to prepare or defend ourselves from natural disasters.
Weapons are designed to kill and in a fight.
In the Second World War so many Germans were killed.
Also many people died in other regions, e.g.
the English.
Poisonous chemical compounds, e.g.
gases and liquids, are created too.
They have been used to kill people.
Most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
.
In wars  communicate with mobile phones to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
By using the Internet we can make new pen friends overseas, and create clubs and societies.
Now a message can travel quicker and it is also .
sending letters takes about a week from Hong Kong to the U.K., but , e.g.
E-mail, is much faster.
The time required is only a few minutes.
Now we can even create a club on Yahoo, which is free.
Modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us many benefits when we use it in the right way, but .
I'm writing this letter to explain the reasons for our disappointment with that evening.
The advertisement for the show said that there were discounts available for children so we brought them and when we bought the tickets we had to pay the maximum price for everyone.
My husband was looking forward to seeing his favourite actor, Danny Brook, and when the show started he found out that Brook had been replaced by a different actor.
My husband was really unhappy.
When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack in the theatre restaurant and it was closed without anyone giving any reason .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as successful as we thought.
I and my friends, including Pat, were preparing a surprise for Sam's birthday.
We decided to go to his place (I've got a copy of the key) the evening before his birthday while he was at work and decorate the lounge, then turn off the lights and wait for him in silence until he arrived.
Everybody was excited about the idea and we were keeping it a secret in front of Sam.
Everybody had to change their plans and the party became a normal party.
We were a bit disappointed but we enjoyed it anyway.
I am writing to make some complaints about the musical show "Over the Rainbow", of which you are the manager.
I would like to say that there were many problems with the show.
The first problem concerned the main actor in the show.
Although it was written in the show's advertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.
The show was supposed to have started at 19:30, but it only started at 20:15, so the audience, including me, was forced to wait for forty-five minutes.
It was also written in the show's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets.
However, there were not any.
The fourth problem concerned the Theatre Restaurant.
Even though the advertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.
In conclusion, the advertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so I would like to ask for my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It all happened a year ago, when Pat and I were still best friends and used to tell each other everything.
One day, I innocently told Pat that I was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy.
I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't.
I believed in her and trusted her blindly.
I went home that day after having told Pat my deepest secret with a weird feeling in my heart.
Something was telling me that I was going to lose a friend and a lover.
The next day, I went to school and found out that Pat had told everybody that I was dating Philip.
Suddenly, an enormous sadness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definitely break up with me, and I knew I was going to stop talking to Pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and I couldn't trust her anymore.
I am writing to you about an incident that occurred at the musical which was put on at your theatre during my week's holiday in London.
First of all, I would like to tell you that it was very disappointing for me that the star was not Danny Brook as your company had advertised.
Moreover, the show was said to start at 19:30 but it really started at 20:15.
As the show finished late, we decided to eat something at your theatre restaurant but, to our surprise, it was closed.
Another thing is that there was not any discount available so we spent a lot of money on a bad show.
I hope this kind of thing does not happen again.
One day, while I was studying maths, one of my friends, called Pat, asked me to have a coffee with her.
We went to a place called 'Deli' where we talked a lot about our school, the exams and, as we usually did, about our friends and boyfriends.
We asked each other a lot of questions but then we started talking about things that had never been talked about with anybody, such as the most important thing that had happened to us in our lives and those kinds of secrets...
The problem started when I confessed to her that I had fallen in love with Larry, who was my cousin's boyfriend.
In spite of the fact that I told her to keep it a secret, she went to my cousin's house and  retold exactly what I had told her.
As a result, my cousin went to my house in order to get herself a detailed account .
As I resolved the problem with my cousin, I understood why my mother had told me that 'friends' sometimes weren't what you expected them to be.
I am writing to complain about your show.
I would like you to return my money because .
I was planning to spend my holiday in London when I found your advertisement.
In the advertisement, you mentioned actors, time, discount and facilities.
DANNY BROOK is one of my favourite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also .
However, when I got to the theatre, you not only didn't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical.
In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner after the musical because the restaurant was closed.
It made me so disappointed and angry.
You should return my money immediately because that night was far from perfect.
He always tried to say nothing and did.
But everyone always saw from his face he had a secret.
Whenever he has a secret, his nose moves quickly.
He did not like this habit and had thought it was bad of him until he solved a big crime.
When all the money had gone from a bank, nobody was there except Pat.
The bank robbers told him if Pat told they would kill him.
So, Pat didn't say anything.
But his nose moved quickly when the police showed him a picture of the bank robbers.
Thanks to his habit, he is still alive and all the money was returned to the bank.
The town became peaceful again.
Last weekend I was in London on holiday.
I had looked forward to going and seeing "London's newest and best musical show "-Over the Rainbow.
I must say I was rather disappointed by the experience.
I was looking forward to taking advantage of the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available.
After the show I had planned to have dinner at the Theatre Restaurant.
Unfortunately the restaurant was closed.
I have heard that they are going to read "The Old Man and the Sea" on the radio, P1, on Wednesday next week.
It is a book written by Ernest Hemingway.
I would really recommend you to listen to it.
The basic story of the book is in fact quite simple.
It is about a tough old fisherman from Cuba who sails out alone in a small boat to fish.
He is only looking for the biggest fishes and he has been unsuccessful for 86 days.
This day he is lucky.
He gets a big swordfish hooked and after a long fight the fish is finally caught.
On his way back home to port he is attacked by sharks who eat the fish he caught piece by piece.
The fisherman kills many sharks with various weapons, but when he reaches port there is only the head, tail and bones left of the huge swordfish.
Mr.
Hemingway makes this simple story a real adventure.
He makes you experience in detail all the struggles the fisherman has when he fights with the swordfish and the sharks.
The fisherman is a typical old, strong and lonely hero of Mr.
Hemingway.
This tale is very amazing and it is no surprise Mr.
Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for it.
I really think you should take time to listen to it on the radio on Wednesday next week.
I was very disappointed with the performance and apart from that there were many other problems.
Firstly, the time of the performance was 19.30 p.m, but the play started at 20.15 p.m.
People were fed up with waiting so long and most of them, apart from me, were rather irritable.
Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor and I had never heard of him.
From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that it would be impossible to find another with the same characteristics.
As far as the tickets were concerned no discounts were available, so, I found it expensive.
The evening was a disaster and I wonder if I have not the right to ask you to return my money, as I think that would be fair.
But this time things had gone too far.
I've known Pat since we were kids.
Little by little we were growing up and becoming close friends.
I relied on her and our relationship was excellent.
I considered her my best friend and I thought we would never drift apart but now I have changed my mind, because she has done something I can't accept.
She has given it away to my mother that I told her a lie as far as the weekend was concerned.
Pat told her I hadn't spent those days with her, but with my boyfriend in the mountains.
My mother was so angry and she told me off so harshly that I will remember it for the rest of my life.
Moreover I was punished harshly by my father and now we don't talk to each other.
Since then I haven't seen Pat anymore and she doesn't seem to regret what happened, so I'll try to forget her and carry on with my life, that's all.
I'm in London for the first time and I wondered what is interesting on your stage: I read in the newspaper the advertisement about the best musical show.
In the advertisement the cast was very interesting - Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Otherwise, the musical show started too late - at 20 15 instead of 17 30! This was a waste of time.
I was very suprised when I saw a different actor.
It wasn't Danny Brook.
This musical show wasn't "the best".
I went out early but the theatre restaurant was closed.
I had a very disappointing evening.
I must ask you for my money back.
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This is a very interesting question for us and maybe very important too.
We think and talk about it in our families.
I saw one week ago on TV the fashion show in Paris and I was very suprised because of the style.
All the models had very strange long shoes made from black leather, the trousers were quite short and the jackets were elegant with emblazoned material.
I think the fashion of the future will be very different but suitable for all people.
People will wear clothes made from natural materials like silk, which will be comfortable and elegant.
The colours will be of a very good quality and the fashions will change very quickly like now.
Because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing (for example a peasant jacket or hat), like they do now in rural areas from time to time.
After reading your advertisement.
I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night.
I was excited to see it.
But everything was terrible and different to your advertisement.
First of all the actor was different.
So I was disappointed.
I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show.
The movie started 20.15 not 19.30.
You wrote 'discounts available' but they didn't offer any discount.
After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant.
The restaurant was closed because of being repaired.
You advertised my perfect evening out.
But it was unpleasant because of these things.
So I ask you to return some money back.
.
I would like to describe how modern technology has changed my daily life as a housewife.
I have a lot of housework to do from early morning until late evening.
I always use many electric appliances; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juicer, fridge.
I think I can have my spare time thanks to these things.
For example if I don't have a washing machine, I would have to wash all the clothes myself.
Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash.
while the washing machine is whirring, I can have my time.
So I can read my book or do another thing.
Also I can't imagine my life without a car.
It would be terrible.
Now I can't live without them.
Owing to all of them, I can live very comfortably.
These things provide me with every convenience.
I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called "Over the Rainbow", and I was very disappointed by it.
First of all I would like to say that it started later than it should have.
I had to wait for about forty-five minutes.
Then I realized that Danny Brook did not appear in the show, which was very diappointing for me because I like this actor very much, and I think that I was not the only one who was upset.
I think that the most disappointing thing was that the theatre's restaurant was closed.
I would add that I was hungry after the show.
First of all I would like to say that modern technology has changed my daily life very much.
Every day when I get up I check if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS on my mobile phone.
They are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive.
Modern technology has a big influence on our life.
It is easier.
We can communicate with people by using mobile phones or telephones, which are the best things ever made.
I use them very often in my daily life.
I THINK THAT TELEVISION HAS the biggest influence on our daily life.
I watch about four hours of TV a day.
I even eat my meals in front of the TV.
We can see PEOPLE'S LIFE in other countries, which is very interesting for me and my friends.
Also the Internet has an influence on my daily life, because I can find there many interesting things, or I can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
I think that life without modern technology would be and boring.
That's why I am using it in my daily life.
I am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology.
I am writing to complain about a musical show called 'Over the Rainbow' that in the Circle Theatre.
There were some problems that were not in the advertisement.
The first problem was about the actors.
In the advertisement it was clearly written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play the main roles.
But I was very disappointed when I didn't see them on the stage.
The second problem was the time of the play.
The advertisement said that the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
I was waiting for the show for half an hour! The third problem was the discounts.
The advertisement said that they would be available but they were not.
The last problem was the theatre restaurant.
It was written in the advertisement that I could visit your theatre restaurant after the show, but unfortunately it was closed.
To conclude, I was not satisfied with the show I watched in your theatre and I would like a full refund.
There are many different creatures on Earth: animals, insects, plants.
But the most developed creature is the human.
He has lived for nearly 10 000 years.
During this time men have developed and now are the leading creatures.
They built huge cities, destroyed forests, went into space.
Now, modern technology has changed our life.
And, naturally, it has both advantages and disadvantages.
The modern technology, on the one hand, has made our life easier.
.
We build big cities, there is hot and cold water, electricity, gas in practically every home.
We use different transport that makes our travel faster, it speeds up our life.
We communicate with other people by telephone and mail, we read newspapers, we watch television, and get different information from the Internet.
All in all, technology has made our life better by destroying the environment.
In future, possibly, the technology won't destroy the environment, but we have to do something now, because tomorrow could be too late.
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play "over the rainbow", which is showing at the Circle Theatre.
First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr.
Danny Brook as the principal actor.
Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage during the play.
Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying.
Secondly, the show started one hour and fifteen minutes late.
We arrived at the theatre on time and we had to wait all that time until the show began.
Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an aggressive employee refused to answer me.
He stayed looking at me and laughing.
It was incredible.
The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from what was promised in the advertisement.
Definitely, I want my money back as soon as possible.
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter, our new classmate at school.
However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion.
Well, that was the beginning of my tragedy.
So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely aggressive.
But I couldn't shut my mouth.
I continued: "You can't believe it, Pat, she wears trousers like a man and green flowery blouses." Of course, my friend and I were laughing for half an hour.
Two days later, when Pat came back to my school, she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told him everything about Ann1.
At precisely that moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece.
I know it's my fault.
But, well, the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets so he told his mother how his brother Jim lost her suit suitcase on the train.
Jim's mum didn't want him to take her suitcase, but he did .
So one morning he reached Victoria Station with the suitcase and took the train for the countryside where he had to work.
But when he walked out of the station he realised that he had left the suitcase on the train.
Then he waited for the next train to London and he caught it.
He was worried about his mother's reaction, but when he arrived he went to the Station Manager's office and he found it on the table.
He was so happy! All this story was a secret but Pat revealed it to his mother.
She was so angry and confused because Jim hadn't told her the truth.
I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about "Over the Rainbow" which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized.
I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all.
In your advertisement it said the show would start at 19:30 but it began at 20:15.
I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time.
Even so, I can't understand why the actors of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't appear in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook.
After all this, I wanted to make my evening pleasant but to my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because of some sanitary problems.
I explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and I want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there.
I hope to hear from you as soon as possible and thanks for understanding my situation.
Many years ago human beings or whatever we were called were another animal species but when we tried to use rocks to make a fire we changed everything.
Modern technology changed our lives in many ways: when I have to wake up earlier I use my alarm clock, if I have to wash my teeth I use my toothbrush with a little toothpaste.
I use my desk to study which was made with trees cut down and by machines more powerful than .
Even so, this is not enough and technology created a better means of communication, first there were letters, then telephones and now we can write letters and receive them through the Internet.
It is not necessary to imagine things, you can travel all around by just making a click with your mouse and you are there.
If I am hungry I open the refrigerator and take food and cook it with a microwave.
When I have a headache I swallow pills, made by technology.
I think everything around us is thanks to technology but we can't forget that these things were made by us.
The human being.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it.
If we create guns to protect our homes, others will use them to burgle our homes, and take advantage of the defenceless people.
However, the technology never stops, we always search for new things because we are made to compete, discover, think of things which we don't know.
I went to the Circle Theatre, three weeks ago, to see "Over the Rainbow", the musical show that was playing at the time.
Plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available.
In fact, no discount was given to me, though I am a student and as a student I was entitled to get a discount but I paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
Finally, I think that this evening was very far from being perfect, and I ask you for my money, which I spent on this horrible evening in your theatre, back.
We can go faster with new technologies, from one place to another, for example, we can use a car or public transport such as the trains or buses instead of walking or riding as we did in the past.
Our everyday activities or family activities are simplified too.
Washing the dishes or clothes by hand is rarely done, some special machines are made to do this stuff, it helps us to spend much more time in extra activities like sport, relaxing...
New technologies allow us to work more efficiently; with computers complex operations can be achieved in a short time and with the assurance that the result is correct.
The Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves about what is happening in the world, or search for a special hobby to get a quick result.
I'd like to explain to you the problems I had when I went to the theatre.
The main problem I had was with the actor, because he wasn't Danny Brook.
Although Tina Truelove was there, I went to the theatre to see Danny Brook.
Another problem I had was with the time of the performance.
It was going to begin at 19.30 but It began at 20.15 and the problem was that It was raining.
I'd like to explain too that I didn't see you give any discounts to anyone.
I was queuing for a long time and I didn't see it happen.
And I went with a lot of friends and we didn't get any discount.
Another problem is that in the advertisement you said we could visit your restaurant but as it was closed we couldn't .
And we were very hungry after being three hours in the theatre.
And those are all the problems I had.
And, because of these problems, I'd like to have my money back.
If you don't mind, of course.
I met Pat when we were children.
We went to the same school and were in the same class.
I liked a boy who was in the same class.
I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say anything to him.
When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secondary school too, but we were in different classes.
We went out every weekend.
And when we finished at the secondary school, I decided go to a foreign University.
I spent five years there, although I came back every summer and we continued going out as we had done before.
When I finished I returned to my city to find a job.
one day, Pat told me that she was talking with this boy and that he told her that he liked me and immediately she told him that I liked him too.
A week after that I found him in a cafe and he asked me if I would like to be his girlfriend and I accepted.
Now, five years later we are going to get married.
Secondly, the show was really late starting.
It started at 20.15, not at 19.30 as it was supposed to .
And, although you had promised them in your advertisement, there were no discounts available.
To make things worse, the restaurant was closed.
The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show on that date.
To sum up, it was not a perfect evening out.
And, I would appreciate it if you gave me a refund.
I look forward to hearing from you.
In my opinion, the clothes will be more colourful, fun and comfortable.
I think that we will not wear formal clothes anymore.
People will prefer to wear comfortable clothes, even to go to the office.
The clothes will be more colourful and consequently more fun.
We will not wear black clothes as we used to .
People will wear yellow, pink and green clothes.
This way, people tend to be happier.
However, the clothes will not be like those teenagers wear nowadays to go to "raves".
They will be more beautiful and clean.
Mainly, people will not be so fashionable as they are nowadays.
They will wear an item of clothing only if they feel good wearing it.
Actually, I think that the clothes will be really simple in 100 years and I hope to be alive until then.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Now all the town knows my secret.
This is a very embarrassing situation.
I have to leave this town.
My god, I never should have told my sister this secret.
This story started when I arrived in this town with my family.
We came here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires.
My mother suggested coming here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us.
I hadn't met all of the family (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) before that day.
My uncle, called Paul, invited us to stay with his family until we had built our house.
Coincidentally my cousin was the same age as me, sixteen, that's the reason we started our friendly relationship.
We spent all our time together.
This "friendly" relationship was starting to get hot.
I had never had a boyfriend and I fell in love with him.
One day in the , he kissed me.
It was wonderful.
I felt that I had discovered .
In fact, I had.
We made love...
But one month later, something surprised me, I was pregnant.
First of all, Danny Brook was not there.
I was very upset because he is my favourite singer and that was one of the reasons why I wanted to see this show.
Then, the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.
My Euro Star was at 22.00.
As you can see, I missed my train to go back to Paris.
, they also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but that was totally wrong because I paid the full price, which was £20.
In conclusion, it was the worst evening I have ever had in my life so I must ask you for my money back.
Modern technology has changed my daily life a lot.
First of all, the Internet makes my life easier.
Some of my friends live overseas.
We keep in touch with e-mails.
It is a very good way to communicate because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read e-mails and keep them forever.
when I go out, sometimes my parents are worried so they phone me to see if everything is alright.
Finally, there is a TV in my parents' car.
We can watch TV.
There is also a map so when we get lost, it is very easy to .
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show "Over the rainbow".
First, the advertisement said that the show was starring Tina Truelove and Danny Brook.
That was not true.
Danny Brook did not act in the show, there was a different actor and I was disappointed with him.
Regarding the times of the performance, the show was supposed to start at 19.30 and it started at 20.15.
Nobody likes to wait 45 minutes just watching empty scenery.
Another thing, the tickets.
The advertisement said that there were discounts available.
That was false, there was not any kind of discount.
After all that I just wanted to go to the theatre restaurant and have something to eat, but it was closed because the police had closed it.
They had closed it because they had found the food in a bad condition.
Just to finish, the advertisement said that the show would be a perfect evening out, let me tell you that it was not.
I paid for a full-price ticket without discount to wait 45 minutes, to see a musical show with a bad actor and after all that could not have a sandwich because the restaurant was closed.
I think the theatre should give me my money back and I hope you do .
Technology has changed, is changing and it will change our daily lives.
Technology is improving every day, soon everything will be done by a machine.
Now we can cook in an easier way than ten years ago, we can talk with somebody who is 10000 kilometres from us and we can know what's happening in another part of the world.
Another thing that is changing our lives is the computer, especially the Internet.
More and more people are connecting to the net.
Soon we won't need to leave our homes.
Now we can buy everything via the Internet, we can see what's happening on Wall Street, we can send mail in an easier way, by e-mail, and many people have started to work at home with their computers.
Technology has changed our daily lives so much that we won't be able to live without it.
Nobody can imagine living without a TV, a computer, a microwave, a telephone.
There are machines for everything, writing, cooking, going from one place to another, talking with somebody who is not with you.
Our lives are very different from our grandparents' lives and that's because of technology.
I am writing to complain about a musical show which is called "Over The Rainbow" and ask for my money back.
This show was presented by the Circle Theatre.
First of all, the poster told me that this show starred Danny Brook and Tina Truelove but there were different actors.
I am so disappointed.
Secondly, the show was meant to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
I was waiting for 45 minutes.
The poster also told me that I could visit the theatre restaurant after the show.
As you know the show started late, so, I was not able to go to the theatre restaurant because it closed before the show finished.
Thirdly, there were no discounts available but .
If there are no discounts, don't on the poster.
I got confused and was disappointed again.
Finally, I would like to have my money back.
I am looking forward to your prompt reply and .
The world is changing every day.
So, modern technology is needed to .
Every single day, and it really affects our daily life.
The most important development is the Internet , which is connected to the whole world's computers by telephone lines.
You can send a letter to your friend by e-mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post.
It just takes you a few minutes.
How convenient it is! There are also many more advantages.
You can buy something in a supermarket .
You don't need to leave your home.
Other than the Internet , there is also a lot of modern technology which is changing our daily life.
For example, we can go to Mars and do some research.
So, we know much more about our universe.
Some modern technology is also .
For example, trains can go faster and aeroplanes can travel faster.
Modern technology has changed our daily life.
It aims to improve our standard of life and allows us to live more comfortably.
So I think the changes are good.
Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to give me some money back.
Last week I was in London to see your new musical show.
Before I bought my ticket and made train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot of good reviews of that show and I thought it would be a great event to share with friends.
But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly, your advertisement is a real lie.
Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late starting, we had been waiting for a long long time before it started.
But finally it started..
and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen before and who did not seem to know his role by heart! Shame on you! After that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurant but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike...
It wasn't at all a perfect evening.
I'm not pleased.
I would weep if I wasn't so angry.
To summarize, I want you to give me my money back and very quickly.
Yours faithfully..
Modern technology had changed the daily lives of human beings long before I was born.
Nowadays, in my opinion, the most important revolution is connected with new technologies.
Let's take the mobile phone.
Our parents used the phone to make important appointments.
Nowadays everybody has got a phone which is "mobile".
And I'm no different, I've got one and it has changed my everyday life.
I can always be reached, I can phone friends when I know I will be late and thanks to that device I feel less nervous and now I'm sure I couldn't live without it.
It's the same with the Internet and that's a very new thing.
I send and receive more e-mails than letters! I can chat with my sister or friends without speaking when I'm working because it takes just a few minutes.
With the Internet and, in my opinion, the world is becoming smaller and bigger at the same time.
Smaller because I can visit an American library without leaving my desk and bigger because it seems to be endless.
Yes my daily life has changed and it's a good thing.
I'm writing this letter to complain about your advertisement.
You are the theatre's manager so I suppose you are the right person to complain to.
First of all, in your show advertisement it says that Danny Brooks stars in the play.
But a different actor was starring and that was very disappointing, not only for me but for all the people there.
The show began late, much later than your advertisement says, at about 20:15.
The show started 45 minutes late.
This made me feel bored.
You also say in your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any.
At the end you said that the theatre restaurant after the show but it wasn't.
It was closed because of the late start of the show.
Modern technology has changed not only my daily life but also the lives of many people.
Now let's talk about me.
First of all, I don't have to worry in the morning about missing the bus because I have my alarm clock to wake me in time.
Usually, when I return from school the food is a little bit cold so I put it in the microwave to make it hotter.
When I go to sleep after I eat my lunch (in my country, especially in summer, it is too hot) I turn on the air conditioning with a timer so when I go to sleep it turns off by itself.
When I wake up, if I don't have homework I sit at my computer and play different games to occupy my time.
In the evenings before I go to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV via satellite.
When I go to bed, because there are many mosquitoes, I turn on a special machine with a battery-like thing in it which kills them.
I believe that modern technology has positively affected our lives.
I want to complain about your advertisement for the production 'Over the Rainbow'; I had a very disappointing evening.
First of all, I wanted so much to see my favourite actor Danny Brook as he was supposed to be in the show, but he wasn't.
Secondly the show didn't start until 20:15 but it should have started at 19:30 so we had to sit and wait, which was very boring.
There were no discounts on the tickets available either.
After the show we wanted to have something to eat in the theatre restaurant but it was closed for refurbishment.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She had always been like that, my best friend Ann said to me when I told her that I had told Pat a secret the day before.
The secret was that I was in love with Peter from my course.
I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone.
Yesterday when I arrived at college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strangely at me and laughing.
I felt how I started to blush.
In the classroom it became even worse.
People started to write things on the board and to point at me.
In the lunch break I went to Pat and asked her why she had told him the secret, but she just ignored me like she didn't know me.
After that I never went back to the course again.
Firstly, the play started nearly an hour later than I expected! If the show had been beautiful, I would have been quite happy to wait.
Then, I had read that there would be discounts available, but that wasn't true! It's better not to write anything if it isn't true .
Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community, not only physically.
We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power.
We have become passive people, we follow the same routine every day and we live in a society where rules are strongly fixed.
I think everyone should live his own life how he wants to live it and make himself known for who he is, not for his money, but for his abilities, his good habits, his personality.
Finally, everyone should slow down his own life's rhythm.
I am writing this letter to complain about the musical show that the Circle Theatre company put on a few days ago.
Nothing the advertisement said was done properly.
The first thing that annoyed me were the forty-five minutes we were waiting for the show to begin.
It is a great failing of responsibility for a theatre like yours to have a delay like this one.
Secondly, another thing that disappointed me was the actor that played the main role.
He was not Danny Brook, and the main reason that I went to see this show was the opportunity to see him acting.
I am a fan of his.
When I went to get the ticket, and the woman told me that the discounts were not available I knew that it wouldn't be a good night.
Finally, the restaurant where I would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed, contrary to what was announced in the advertisement.
Nobody told us the reason for these problems.
These are the reasons why I am complaining, and I would like to know if there will be any refunds.
I will be waiting for news from you.
Perhaps, modern technology has changed my lifestyle but I don't think so because I was born in the period of modern developments.
Since I was born I have lived with technological instruments like personal computers, mobile phones, television, etc.
And the development of them doesn't worry me, as it does people who are against technology.
The only thing I can say about technology is that it has driven my life.
Modern technology captures my imagination, and this is the reason why I have chosen a career in electronics.
I don't think technology changes lifestyle.
It is the lifestyle or needs of people that make technology develop.
All kinds of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to save time.
But these machines bring new problems that must be solved by others.
The Manager of the Circle Theatre.
The 21st century is also known as the golden century of high technology and science.
And I must admit that this is true.
Many things have changed within the last 100 years.
Technology - along with science - has made huge steps and has turned into an ever-growing monster.
Every single day we hear about new products, new methods, new technological miracles which have turned our daily lives upside down.
The simplest example of modern high technology is the introduction of the computer - better known as the PC .
Research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC.
Some people use them for their job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
Other examples that may not look like huge technological miracles are the TV, the microwave, the video, the satellite dish, the CD player and hundreds of others.
All these play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them.
We have all turned into pathetic, technological robots.
Those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but they take us away from our friends, our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
I am writing to you to complain about the last Saturday evening performance at your theatre.
I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this change before the performance.
Secondly, the show started 45 minutes late.
We could not get any discounts on the price and no worker wanted to give us an explanation for that.
I am sure you understand why I am so upset and you will do your best to give me satisfaction, I mean, refunding me exactly what I paid for this terrible evening.
Technology allows us to have more time for leisure or for other things we really like to do.
We can take care of those we love and give them more attention; time is not really a problem.
We will see people differently, more calmly, because we suffer no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else.
We will be more understanding with others.
It is the first step towards a true fraternity.
Of course, everything cannot be completely perfect.
All this modern technology increases the level of waste products that cannot be easily destroyed.
Living better, people live longer and it is necessary to produce more food, but more food means chemical agents on the earth, the circle never stops.
In conclusion, modern technology allows me to live better and to have more time to do what I really like, although, I know, all this has a price.
I'm writing to complain about your theatre and its show last night.
Firstly I would like to say that I was very disappointed with the show and that I didn't have the perfect evening out, as advertised.
I don't know where to start.
The main character of the musical show, who I'd like to say wasn't the "BEST", was awful.
His acting was not good and he didn't seem to like acting.
Even my son could act better.
After the terrible acting of your star, comes the starting time.
I was sitting waiting for forty-five minutes until the play started.
You advertise that the show begins at 19.30 and not at 20:15, as it did.
And then, when I arrived at the theatre, I expected to have a discount but unfortunately I didn't.
On top of all this, the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef and the waiters were on holiday.
You could hire other staff to do the work.
I was very disappointed, what else can I say.
It was supposed to be my perfect evening out.
But it wasn't.
I am asking for my money back.
In conclusion, I'd like to recommend that you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I shouldn't have told her that my dad had psychological problems.
I knew that she was going to spread it around and tell my brother.
It all started when I was about 10 years old, as my brother is now, and I overheard my mother talking about my father and his problems to my aunt.
I was hurt inside and cried till my tears ran dry.
I couldn't accept it.
All these years I believed that my father was killed in a car accident.
I was living a lie.
Now at the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake of mentioning this problem to my "friend" Pat.
I knew that she was close to my brother and that she loved him a lot, so I never thought that things would turn out like this.
When one day Pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up.
Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was really going on.
My brother couldn't stay away.
He stood outside my door and heard every single word.
When I realised , it was too late.
The secret had been revealed.
And now I try to help my brother because I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels.
According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisingly,  was performed by a different actor of whom I didn't even know the name.
In addition, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started half an hour later, at 20:15.
To make matters worse, I had expected to get a discount on the ticket, but when I went to the ticket office, there was not any discount available.
The last thing is the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, because it only opened until 9 o'clock at night.
You can imagine how disappointed I was, spending money on such a terrible evening.
I would like you to look into the matter immediately and I insist on getting some money back.
I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply as soon as possible.
Nowadays, we use a lot of modern technology both at home and in the office but it has its advantages and disadvantages.
The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier, for instance the rice cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on, it makes cooking more efficient.
Furthermore, we use the computer and telephone a lot.
Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want.
It is often suggested that modern technology makes the gap bigger between people, they get used to communicating with the machine then forget how to deal with human beings.
To sum up, I believe that modern technology could help our daily life but we should not always rely on it.
Spending a week in London on holiday last week, I decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show.
Unfortunately, I had a really disappointing evening! Indeed, first, the performance didn't start at 19:30 as it was meant to according to the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15).
Then, the actors (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) who were mentioned in the advert and were supposed to perform weren't present.
There were different actors who took their roles.
Thus, the musical show wasn't as good as it should have been.
I was very disappointed because D.
Brook and T.
Truelove are such great actors and I was very excited about seeing them.
Furthermore, in the advertisement I got, it was written that the theatre restaurant was open.
I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe have a better evening than I was having at the beginning of the show but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal.
No reasons were given.
From the beginning of the century to now, modern technology has changed and has made our daily life easier.
Indeed, modernisation helps us to lead a more comfortable and better life than before.
For example, cars and planes are wonderful inventions! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go from one city to another or to travel abroad.
People couldn't of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created.
Mankind became more and more clever and built wonderful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands.
Communication has made many advances too.
Everyone has a television at home.
"A machine which talks and shows pictures!" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago.
Although there are new machines etc, medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
Thus, modern technology seems to be a positive way to improve our daily life.
I am writing to you to complain about the show "Over the Rainbow" at your theatre "The Circle Theatre".
I am deeply disappointed with the service and the unreliable information at your theatre.
I attended your show one evening, during my stay in London.
In your advertisement you've mention "Danny Brook" would be starring and as it turned out it was a different Danny Brook.
I am very disappointed by this.
You also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and that meant forty-five minutes of waiting.
.
For Example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
Lastly, your advertisement stated clearly that this would be "Your perfect evening out!" but sadly it was a real waste of time for me.
And I would like a refund.
You have wasted my evening and money.
In the past 100 years, fashion has changed a great deal.
Nowadays clothes are designed to be more comfortable.
You can just "pop down the road" and go shopping.
The material and colours of your clothes have changed since the early 1900s .
Synthetics have been created by scientists.
Clothes are now mass-produced and designed by designers.
Designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
It is hard to imagine what people will wear in 100 years' time, because since the 1900s clothes have .
Maybe .
Scientists might discover a new way to make clothes more .
It could be that you will carry a small round box.
It would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
This would be very easy to but it would mean no more shopping for girls.
It would be scary to live , but it would be interesting to see what will happen.
Hopefully everybody wouldn't be walking around naked.
Moreover, the show started late: instead of 19.30 (the time in the advertisement) people were allowed in at 20:15, resulting in a waiting time of 45 minutes.
There were two other problems: there were no discounts, contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repair work.
We are living in a technologically advanced world where we are surrounded by all sorts of devices which would seem fantastic to our ancestors.
My daily life has been changed much by modern technology without me noticing it up to this point.
Just looking around, I realise that modern technology has crept into every area of my life.
I would rather type some course work up than hand-write it.
This makes my life easier, and at the same time saves some trees in a rain forest from being cut down.
When I am too tired to go out but want to meet some new people, computer technology provides me with the opportunity.
Using the Internet, I can meet people from all around the world without going anywhere.
With all the resources on the Net I don't need to go to the library as often as I used to.
I guess I haven't realised until now how much my daily life has been changed by modern technology.
This leaves me wondering how beneficial its influence is for me.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE SHOW THAT YOUR THEATRE PUT ON.
I WENT TO YOUR THEATRE WITH THE IDEA OF HAVING A GREAT TIME.
UNFORTUNATELY, THINGS WENT VERY WRONG.
FIRSTLY, IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE STAR WAS DANNY BROOK, AND THAT WAS WRONG BECAUSE THERE WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR.
THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING.
SECONDLY, THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO START AT HALF PAST SEVEN IN THE AFTERNOON, BUT IT STARTED AT QUARTER PAST EIGHT, THAT IS FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER! IT IS ALSO ADVERTISED THAT THERE WERE DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE.
HOWEVER, THAT WAS ANOTHER LIE.
LASTLY, AFTER THAT AWFUL EXPERIENCE I TRIED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, OF COURSE, I COULDN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED.
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT WASN'T MY PERFECT EVENING OUT (AS YOU PROMISED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT), SO I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK.
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS AND I DISCOVERED THAT TOO LATE.
IF I HAD KNOWN THAT BEFORE, I WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HER THAT I HAD FAILED MY MATHEMATICS EXAM.
LAST WEEK I HAD AN ARGUMENT WITH MY MOTHER.
SHE TOLD ME THAT I WAS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS, SO MY EXAM RESULTS WERE GOING TO BE VERY BAD.
I SAID THAT I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING AND THAT MY MARKS WOULD BE GOOD.
AFTER THAT PAT INVITED ME TO GO TO THE CHARLY GARCIA CONCERT.
THE CONCERT WAS PLANNED FOR THE FOLLOWING FRIDAY, WHICH WAS THE DAY AFTER MY TEACHER GAVE ME MY MARKS.
I REALLY WANTED TO GO, AND I KNEW THAT MY EXAM HAD GONE BADLY, SO I TOLD MY MOTHER THAT I WOULD GET MY RESULTS THE NEXT MONDAY, SO MY MOTHER ALLOWED ME TO GO.
THAT FRIDAY, I KNEW THAT I HAD FAILED THE EXAM, AND PAT KNEW IT TOO.
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT TELLING THAT TO MY MOTHER, BUT PAT CAME TO MY HOUSE AND TOLD MY MOTHER, WITHOUT ANY INTENTION OF DOING SO.
AS A RESULT, I WASN'T ALLOWED TO GO TO THE CONCERT, BUT PAT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS GREAT.
I'm writing to you to describe some problems with your theatre's show.
First I have to say to you that there was a different actor to the one advertised starring in the play.
I expected the star of the play to be Danny Brook and there was another man.
I'm very disappointed with the time that the play started.
I had been waiting for more than half an hour.
About the price, the that I have at home states that there were discounts available, if these discounts are real I couldn't use them.
When the show had finished I couldn't visit the theatre restaurant because it was closed.
The reason they gave us was that they hadn't got any waiters.
For all those reasons I have given you, I ask for the money I spent back.
In my opinion it wasn't my perfect evening out.
I'm sorry if I cause you any problem, but I'm very angry and it was your fault.
I am writing this letter to you in order to complain about the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; on Friday evening.
First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances.
These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion of your company, which is said to be the best producer of musical shows in Europe.
With all these considerations in mind, I attended your theatre on the referred day with the aim of having a perfect evening.
However, .
To start with, it was impossible to obtain any of the offered discounts, even though I presented an official ISIC card.
Then, the audience had to wait 45 minutes past the announced time of the performance for the show to get started.
And finally, when they came on, we realised that it was not Danny Brook performing, which was really disappointing.
Nowadays we can see a very different world from the one our grandparents, or even our parents, were living in.
Actually, whereas they used to talk about how their daily lives had changed in comparison with previous generations', we remain astonished, looking at how our lives are changing frenetically.
We have hardly assimilated one piece of new technology when it is replaced or modified by another.
Electronic devices and 'gadgets' make our daily lives more comfortable and easier, but does that mean that we live better than ever? Of course, they have liberated us from a lot of tough routines, giving us the chance to have more free time.
However, instead of enjoying this fantastic opportunity, people have become hooked on technological advances, feeding back their development in an accelerating, non-stop race.
Machines now do most of the hard work, but this does not mean that we are working less.
People spend more and more time working, searching for new inventions that will make life easier, but then fail to profit from all the benefits obtained.
I am writing to you to complain about the problem that happened in the play called "Over the rainbow", and why I would like to get some money back.
The problem is that most of the advertisement was misleading.
First of all, there were no discounts on the tickets' prices, and they were advertised.
Secondly, the play was advertised as starting at 19.30, but it started at 20:15.
Despite this fact, which I did not care about at first, when the play started I did not see Danny Brook, who is my favourite actor; I saw another actor who was not Danny Brook.
Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it.
But the main reason for my complaint, is that in the advertisement it was said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not.
Therefore, for all these reasons, I would be happy to get some money back.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Technology has affected my daily life so much.
If I did not have it, I could not do most of the things that I do today.
First of all, if I did not have it, I would not be able to get out of the city because I would not have a car.
But we have it, and the thing that has changed my life most is the Internet.
Nowadays, with my computer, I can travel anywhere in the world, just by having it connected to a modem.
The Internet has changed my life because, with it, we can do everything at home.
For example if one day I forgot a book, I can find the book on the Internet, and more information too.
In conclusion I think that without technology we could not live as well as we live now, and our lives would be so very boring.
Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays.
The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late.
We bought tickets for the second show, which was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested in seeing the actors that appeared on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw other actors.
The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw on the tickets that there would be discounts given, but, they didn't give us discounts! With all these problems, the only thing that kept us going was the thought of eating something.
When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because the staff didn't go to work that day.
So it was the worst evening that I had ever had.
I ask you to consider all my reasons and to return my money.
I think that is the only thing you can do.
It was Saturday night, and I was with my sister Pat alone in my home.
That night I was invited to a great party, but I was being punished, and I had to stay at home with my sister.
My parents were away for the weekend.
When it was time to go to the party I decided to escape without telling my sister.
Unfortunately when I returned she was waiting for me in my room.
When I entered my room she was very happy, because my father would punish me again.
Of course, she would tell him, but I decided to pay her if she stayed quiet.
She accepted and I paid her a lot of money.
On Sunday night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on Saturday.
My sister stayed silent for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, knew that I had gone out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.
THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS THE HISTORY OF WORLD CONQUEST.
THAT SAID, TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN'S EVOLUTION.
FURTHERMORE, DURING THE LAST TWO CENTURIES, THERE HAS BEEN AN ENORMOUS TECHNOLOGICAL EXPLOSION.
WHILE THE XIX CENTURY GAVE US THE STEAM ENGINE, FACTORIES AND THE ELECTRIC LIGHT BULB, THIS CENTURY HAS GIVEN US NUCLEAR ENERGY (AND SADLY ATOMIC WEAPONS), THE COMPUTER, THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION.
TODAY, I CAN DO MOST OF MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK WITH THE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND IT DOESN'T WEIGH MORE THAN AN APPLE! I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IN THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM.
I HAD NEVER USED THE INTERNET BEFORE, BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE.
A few days ago, as I was having a week's holiday in London, I read your advertisement, which convinced me to go to see your show: Over The Rainbow.
I must tell you that this show was the worst one I had ever been to.
To put it in a nutshell, contrary to what was described in the advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and that is why I would like to get my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
When you told her something important, she could not help telling it to someone else so as not to be the only one to know it.
Actually, even though she was seventeen, she still behaved like a ten-year-old child and it was very difficult for her to know that she could not do or tell something - like a secret, for example.
Thus when Sally explained to her that she had fallen in love with Kevin, Pat felt very awkward.
In fact, she knew that even if Sally was her best friend, she would not be able to keep such a secret.
It might seem a bit strange but if Pat had been able to choose whether she wanted to know a secret or not, she would have preferred not to know it.
Pat was totally upset.
She felt all the more ill at ease as Sally trusted her.
Thus when Sally asked her not to reveal the secret, Pat ran away, went home, and locked herself in her bedroom.
But when she saw the phone that she used in order to call her friends, she started to cry since she knew that she would use it.
I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday.
I was very excited at the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it would.
First of all, the starring actors were supposed to be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Tina did act, but Danny Brook was replaced by an awful actor whose name I don't recall.
Second of all, the play was supposed to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
I'm not used to wasting my time sitting on a chair waiting, I do have better things to do with it.
Another thing I want to complain about is that you advertised that discounts were available, but there wasn't any discount at all.
To finish my "marvellous" evening, I wanted to eat at your restaurant, but it was closed and no reason was given.
Now you're probably asking yourself what does that mean, well, now I'm going to explain it to you.
Two years ago in this school, Pat and I used to be best friends.
We used to tell everything to each other.
I was having some family problems, so my marks were going down and down.
Pat was worried, she didn't know what to do.
One day she looked me in the eyes with a sharp, deep look, never have I seen such a deep look, and asked me what was happening and I told her as I always used to.
That afternoon she visited me and told me a plan she had designed to make my marks rise.
It consisted in stealing the school from the computer, in other words, hacking into the school software.
I thought it was a great idea, so I stole about ten tests we were scheduled to do.
Pat couldn't stand the pressure of the "crime" so she told the school directors that I stole the tests.
I was punished, nearly expelled, but Pat didn't receive any punishment.
I never accused her of lying, and if you ask me why, I really don't know.
Two days before I read an advertisement for this show, which said that Danny Brook was starring.
Unfortunately, last evening there was a different actor and that was very disappointing.
Apart from that, the show started at 20:15, not at 19:30, as it said in the advertisement and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished.
I am in London for a week and I have to say that last evening I had an awful time, so I want some of my money back.
I am looking forward to receiving your reply with my money.
Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother wanted to talk to me about something, so I went into her bedroom to speak to her.
She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went to a party without asking her and that she had to punish me for that.
She told me that I had to stay at home at the weekend and not go out with my friends.
I called him and we had a big argument.
Pat is not a reliable person, so he is not my best friend anymore.
I am writing in order to complain about the musical show, the name of which is Over the Rainbow, which I saw in your theatre recently.
I like this musical very much and while I was spending some days in London I saw your advertisement so I decided to go to see it.
First of all, I had problems with tickets because I could not get the discounts that you mentioned in the advertisement.
It was a pity but it did not annoy me because I thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for.
So I entered the theatre to enjoy the musical but I do not know the reason why it started at a quarter past eight (three quarters of an hour late).
Then I got irritable and I thought that the organization was very bad because nobody explained to us the reasons why the show was late starting.
Finally, when the musical started I realized that Danny Brook, my favourite actor, was not there.
In your advertisement his name was in big letters and in the musical there was a different actor.
After the show I decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarette to try to calm myself and suddenly I could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman's day off.
I am very indignant because I wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so I would like you to return my money and take note of all these problems.
If you do not return my money I will send a letter to a lawyer.
A long time ago technology wasn't an important thing for people because they didn't appreciate it.
Change wasn't common and Governments didn't invest enough money in it.
Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day.
For instance, modern technology is changing the way I work.
My computer is faster and it is able to do a lot of things that I wasted a lot of time on before.
Not only are computers useful for storing information but also computers can give you a lot of information thanks to the Internet.
On the other hand, I realise that modern technology is not as good as people think: I hate mobiles.
I know that some people need them to work but I can't understand why teenagers need them.
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse these changes and to put limits on technology, because I think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
I heard somebody say, "Exciting books always describe people in difficult situations".
Well, I would not agree that this statement is always true, but it is true in the case of the book "The Old Man and the Sea" by Ernest Hemingway.
The context of the book is easy to understand and not very spectacular: an old fisherman is alone on the vast sea, fighting with a strong fish he has caught.
What makes the situation difficult is that neither of the two characters wants to give up.
It becomes a life and death struggle.
The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist.
He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and nature.
So he bears everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, being injured from keeping hold of the line on which the fish is caught.
The reader feels for him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.
17th of June of 2000 Dear Sir, I am writing to complain about various things which I am very disappointed with.
I went to the theatre to see the musical show called 'Over the Rainbow'.
There I met with many problems.
First of all, I bought four tickets for £20 each and discounts were not available.
Secondly, I arrived at the theatre at 9:15 because the time of the performance was 9:30.
However, the show started at 20:15.
I was fed up with waiting.
The worst thing of all was that at the beginning of the show I realized that the actors were totally different from the ones advertised.
They were worse than the previous actors.
After the show, my friends and I were very furious because of all this.
We decided to go to the theatre restaurant to eat something and to relax.
The surprise was that the restaurant was closed.
I am really annoyed.
In my opinion, you have to give us back us money because everything that you wrote in your advertisement was not true.
I hope to get your answer soon.
Finally, I want to tell you this is the last time that I come to your theatre.
Thank you.
Yours sincerely CAROLINA RODRIGEZ.
I have gone out onto the street and I have asked people this question.
I have all the answers and I have written this article.
Most people think that character, person and clothes are of a piece.
They believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
I really think that living in the future will be like living on the moon - very exciting.
And people will wear cybernetic clothes but at the same time comfortable clothes.
I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc.
And all of this with a lot of colour.
From my point of view, they will enjoy themselves more than people do now because they will have many things to do.
On the other hand, most people in the future will wear glasses.
That is because sunlight is very bad.
In the end everyone will be short-sighted.
I write to complain about the show "Over the Rainbow" I saw last night.
Firstly I was very disappointed to find out that unheard-of actors were playing instead of the ones we all expected.
In addition to this, I listened to bad singers and noticed a lack of variety in the dancing.
I know this is not your fault, but it was very annoying.
This show might be the newest in London, but it is at all the best.
Finally I do think it would be fair to give the audience their money back - so I am asking you for a complete refund (cash) of the ticket price.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
We all know that she isn't good at keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time.
Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days.
Their parents were so happy that they decided to give him a fantastic present: the brand new car he had always dreamed of.
This should have been a big surprise for him: the car was bought and everything was prepared in a very hush-hush atmosphere.
The great day came.
The car was already parked near the rear door and there was an unusual level of activity all over the house.
Everyone seemed to be looking for something.
"Are you looking for these?" asked Philip, showing the keys to the car.
And disappeared, heading for the rear door.
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that took place yesterday evening.
None of the conditions were fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed for another actor.
As a result it was a disappointing performance.
Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said that it was going to begin at 19:30.
Furthermore, there weren't any discounts on the price of the tickets.
I am very surprised that such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises that were made in the advertisement.
Of course, what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and I would be very grateful if you could refund me the price of my ticket.
I imagine they will be very different.
Scientists will invent new materials that will keep the body's temperature in a suitable range.
In that way people won't feel cold or hot, they will always be at the same temperature.
In addition these new materials will weigh hardly anything.
As well as that, people won't be as worried about fashion as nowadays, however, it will be very important that clothes are comfortable and suitable for your work and daily duties as well as sport and everything you have to do.
For that reason clothes will be simpler and more practical.
Besides, everybody will be able to afford to buy them then .
That's because the price of this sort of material will be very affordable.
Of course, the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the world we live in.
I write this letter because I think there were too many problems concerning your musical show: "Over the rainbow".
First, I expected to find Danny Brook as the main actor, but she must have been replaced since the actor was different.
I was so disappointed that I was thinking of leaving your theatre.
Nevertheless, I stayed since I had paid.
I also want to put the emphasis on the fact that the show started at 8.15 pm instead of beginning at 7.30 pm.
It was really a shame! In fact, if I had known, I would have probably stayed at home.
We see on the advertisement that discounts are available.
Nonetheless, there were no discounts available at all.
And, we were not allowed to visit your theatre restaurant because it was closed.
Indeed, there was a little note on the door which informed us that the restaurant was closed due to illness.
I think that modern technology changes my daily life.
Indeed, daily life is easier thanks to technology.
For example, if I want to buy something, I can go on my computer and buy it.
But it will make me lazy.
On the one hand technology is a good thing seeing that we've got more and more opportunities to enjoy ourselves since it invents a lot of products.
But on the other hand, technology's products are sometimes expensive and I can't afford them.
In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it had never existed since there are too many things on the market.
Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different makes.
And it's all the more tiring since you often wait for two weeks before getting it.
I'm bound to feel tense.
I'm writing this letter to complain about some aspects of the musical show "Over the rainbow", which was played in your theatre.
It was a very disappointing evening so I ask for my money back.
The first problem we had was that the discounts announced in the advertisement were not available and we had to pay the full price.
I think that all these problems could have been avoided and that asking for my money back is the best way of forgetting that evening.
Fashion news is followed by lots of people.
People have always looked for the most comfortable clothes for their daily lives.
I think that this tendency will not change but what will change is life.
We tend to be a society that wants more free time so people will need more comfortable clothes to enjoy it.
Another important thing will be the use of technology.
Scientists are looking for new materials that will make our clothes more comfortable and stronger.
Clothes will have a strong relation to the new technologies, and modern devices will be included in our everyday clothes.
Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected to technology and society.
To begin with, according to your advertisement, discount tickets are available.
However, I could not get them.
So I could not get a good seat.
Finally, I would like to ask you to give me some money back.
I look forward to receiving a satisfactory reply by return of post.
In my opinion, modern technology has changed my daily life significantly.
To begin with, I think the mobile phone is very useful because I can make a phone call wherever I am, without looking for a telephone box.
When I meet my friends somewhere but cannot arrive there on time, I can tell them about it using the phone.
On the other hand, when I do not want anybody to disturb me, the phone annoys me.
Secondly, as far as I am concerned, the computer is a great invention.
With the Internet and E-mail, I can get lots of information from everywhere, and I can get in touch with my friends who live abroad.
Since I bought a computer, I have been checking for E-mails from my friend almost every day.
, I feel happy even if there is only one.
On balance then, I think that modern technology really affects my life even though I feel that it advances too rapidly for me to catch up.
Last week, I was on holiday in London, and having read the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (as it said) "a perfect evening out".
I was a little hungry after the show, , I had to find another restaurant since the theatre restaurant was closed with no further information given.
Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well until she repeated to everyone the secret I had told her.
There was only one thing I didn't like about her: she would do anything to have friends, even betray me.
No one knew apart from me and my mother.
I kept lying when somebody asked where my dad was.
"He's travelling around the world," I would say, and everyone would admire him.
But I knew Pat knew, and because of her, so did everyone else: he was in prison because he had killed a man.
I know, now, why I wanted to hide the truth.
I was displeased from the very beginning, because I expected to get a discount as I'm a student.
According to your advertisement I could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all.
But nevertheless I decided to go to your show.
The show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30.
I had to wait in the overcrowded hall.
When the show finally started I found out that Danny Brook had been replaced by another actor.
One of the reasons for my visiting your show was Danny Brook's participation.
So, you could understand how disappointed I was.
To make matters worse, the restaurant which was mentioned in your advertisement was closed.
So I didn't have such a perfect evening as was promised in your advertisement.
In fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and I would be greatful if you could give me back a part of my money.
In my opinion, modern technologies play an important role in people's lives.
I think that at present the most important technologies are computer and internet technologies.
Both computers and the Internet influence people's lives.
I have to use a computer every day.
It helps me with preparing my homework.
First of all the Internet gives you access to a great number of different .
On the one hand, the Internet is often used for entertainment, but on the other hand it's also used in different business and education .
With the help of internet technologies I communicate with other people from all over the world it gives me the chance to improve my English.
In my view, the Internet can be used in education, because it gives an opportunity to have remote communication between pupils and teachers.
Though the Internet has a lot of positive aspects, I think you should be careful with it and not be dependent on it.
I bought the ticket for the evening performance to end the day with a nice musical.
But the time wasn't kept.
I had to wait 45mins to get in! So in order to keep myself occupied for a while, I went to the restaurant but it wasn't open.
I couldn't see anyone inside either.
No one.
The show itself was quite disappointing.
The show was OK though I suggest you hire different actors.
I think Danny Brook doesn't suit the role he plays in this musical...
Anyway, after watching the musical, I felt a bit peckish so I went to the restaurant again with the hope that it might be open, but still, nobody was in.
Then a person appeared, walking towards the door to the kitchen, I guessed.
I asked him why the restaurant was closed.
He said it was because the manager of the restaurant had gone out to arrange the food supply for the next day.
They had been closed for 3 days according to him.
So you see my point.
It wasn't very pleasant.
So I am going to ask for a refund...
I hope this isn't offending you too much...
Or asking you for too much.
Shoes will be high heeled and modern.
Colours to match the clothes.
Still, comfortable.
I think they'll be based on some kind of space theme and aliens.
I am writing this letter to let you know about the bad points of the theatre.
It was written in the newspaper that Danny Brock performed in the play.
But it was not Danny Brock, it was a different actor.
If there had been a problem, we should have been told.
I wanted to see him but I couldn't see him.
This was very disappointing for me.
When I was buying a ticket, there was no discount.
But in the newspaper there was said to be a discount.
I paid £20 to the cashier.
I was hungry and I thought I could eat something at the theatre restaurant after the show.
But it was closed without any reason.
It was very rude.
For this, I want my money back because I didn't enjoy at the theatre.
I hope you will not continue like this.
We use cars, trains, ships or planes when we want to go somewhere.
But if they weren't made, we would have to walk or go by horse or donkey.
With the help of technology, we do our work in less time.
For example, in the past, people used horses to go to another place.
And their life passed .
But now we use planes to go to far away places.
It takes less time than going by horse.
And computers are the most important product of technology.
In the world, people spend the whole day playing with computers.
Not only as a hobby.
They use computers for their work.
They communicate with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers.
Sometimes they don't go to their offices.
They write their secret notes on computers.
Computers hold them in their memory.
But in the past people had to use lots of notebooks and they also had to find places to hide them.
But it also has bad points.
For example, wars.
Using technology, scientists make lots of powerful guns.
It is bad for world peace.
I think we should use technology for peace and use it for our benefit.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the show you put on two weeks ago at your theatre.
As I was spending a weekend in London.
I took the opportunity to see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook.
Unfortunately as soon as I got to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore.
Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking of having it at your restaurant.
You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.
In conclusion, I would like to have the two tickets refunded, considering also that there were no discounts available, in contrast to what was stated in the advertisement.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
In fact this was the main reason for Mr White's resignation and suicide.
Pat was not a very clever teenager and while she was attending Secondary School she had many problems with Chemistry.
I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr.
White she would never have passed her exam to enter University.
Mr White came to our school when he was 40 years old but still good-looking and all my female school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girl felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them.
One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree.
Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her classmates and she ran away as fast as she could.
She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any hesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen.
The next day Mr White was charged with abuse and obliged to resign.
The trial was long and received wide coverage from the media.
We live in a small and old-fashioned town and Mr.
White was considered a monster: losing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died, terrified by the darkness which was nearing.
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, which took place in your establishment, The Circle Theatre, which made me feel very upset.
First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London.
I was very excited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theatre the problems began.
I was looking forward to getting a discount of several pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet promises, however, it did not happen.
After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I am concerned, the show must begin on time, but it started forty-five minutes late.
Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seen before, and the restaurant was closed with no notice.
Lastly, for all these reasons my evening was horrible, and that is why I would like to ask you for my money back as soon as possible.
These days, technology has become a very common thing, even among children.
It is such an evolution for the human race, however, we cannot forget that it can cause some problems too.
Firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the Internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
On the other hand, technology has broadened the differences between poor and rich people to a great degree, and this is one of the biggest causes of violence in all countries.
In addition to that, people will always be afraid of a technological war.
In conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore, we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to survive in the future.
I went to the Circle Theatre yesterday, to see the play "Over The Rainbow" and I must say that I was rather disappointed.
First of all, the play was supposed to start at 7:30 P.M.
but it actually started at 8:15 P.M.
so I had to wait forty-five minutes.
Also, your advertisement says that discounts are available.
That is not quite true because when I asked for one, the woman who sells the tickets replied with a resounding, "No".
When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, contrary to what the advertisement says, which really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.
But my complaints are not over yet.
After the disappointing performance of the actor who replaced Danny Brook, I went to the theatre restaurant, and, also in contrast to what was said on the advertisement , it was closed.
There was only a small sign stuck on the door, saying that it was "closed for repairs".
So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and having given the reasons, I expect to be able to count on your sense of responsibility, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night.
As we all know, technology has improved gigantically over the last 20 years, and today, it affects us in many ways.
First of all, we have all become much more sedentary than in the past.
Most of the modern jobs involve computers, so there is no physical effort, just mental, but, on the other hand, we improved communications with computers and the Internet, the kind of communication where there is no need to meet personally, to see the other person, just the need to talk.
Also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
So, men have invented machines to help them with their tasks, but nowadays, we are becoming slaves to .
The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers from an early age, so that they can have a chance to compete with the furious of the future.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "over the rainbow".
I recently booked a week's holiday in London, to see the musical "over the rainbow", the date was the 9th of June 2000, with your firm.
It was said that Danny Brook would play the leading part, but there was a different actor instead.
This really disappointed me.
We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play was supposed to start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 before it started.
It was also said that discounts were available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts.
The theatre Restaurant that should be open after the show was closed because the chef was ill and there was no food in the fridge.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
How could she manage to keep quiet about this? This was the best thing that had ever happened to the Fennall family for yeats.
Maria was still a little bit shocked by the news that she would be having a baby.
She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded.
The rest of the family understood that something was wrong because Pat started to buy baby clothes.
Which was very shocking for her mother.
I'm writing to you to complain about a play I have seen, called: "Over the rainbow".
This show was very disappointing for me for many reasons.
First of all, I was very surprised by the absence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons for booking a seat.
Also, I'm unhappy about the inaccurate information in your advertisement, which clearly says the play begins at 19.30, instead of 20.15 like my evening's show.
At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the other spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons being given and nobody came to us to apologise or advise us about another restaurant open late at night.
That's why, in response to all these problems, I'm asking you to give back some money.
I'm looking forward to having an answer from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
That's why all his friends were angry with him and left him alone.
It was clear that Pat had to change and show his friends that they could believe in him thoroughly.
For those next few days, Pat would do his best to be as sympathetic as possible.
To begin with, every morning Pat said a pleasant "hello" and added to that a big smile.
His mother always says: "If you are smiling and are nice to people, people will be nice and will smile at you".
As Pat always does what his mother says his friends began to play with him again, but not just his old friends, everybody wanted to play with him.
The moral of the story here is very clear: be nice to people and people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend.
We had a really unenjoyable time at your theatre.
And I would like to know if it is possible to have our money back.
Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately Pat wasn't good at keeping secrets.
So one week later all the students in my class knew that I was an angel.
Really! Nobody believed her...
nor me.
But it's true...
I'm an angel and I wanted to visit the earth.
It's easy to do but the only rule was I could tell my secret to only one person.
And if someone else knew, I wouldn't be able to go back to heaven unless I killed the person who told my secret.
I began to follow my plan.
I went to Pat's house but her brother told me that she wasn't there.
I offered to wait...
Her brother and I began to talk...
He's such a nice boy.
I liked him very much and I guessed he liked me too...
We started to go out at the same time as I started to change my mind.
I don't want to go back to heaven anymore as long as I am with him.
A few days ago I went to London to have a nice holiday.
I was expecting to have fun, so I decided to go to the play "Over the Rainbow", that's now showing in your theatre.
I read the advertisement and I thought it was going to be a pleasant evening.
From the beginning it was all a disappointment.
When I went to buy the ticket I tried to get a discount with my student card, but that was not possible.
I let this pass and I bought it anyway, thinking that it was possible that this was only a mistake in your advertisement.
But the play started forty-five minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan who was the main reason for why I decided to see the play, had been changed for another actor, who turned out to be really bad.
You will understand how upsetting all this was, and I decided to visit your restaurant, thinking that could save my visit to the theatre, but it was closed and I had to go back to my hotel feeling mad and hungry.
I think you realise why I'm writing this letter to ask you to give me my money back.
All the things that were promised in your advertisement were untrue, and it was definitely NOT the perfect evening out.
Expecting that you will resolve this misunderstanding.
I think that some of the changes have been very good, like the improvement in medical science, which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.
It has changed the ways people communicate.
First the telegraph and the radio and now TV, the telephone and the Internet allow people to be in contact with others really quickly, and distances aren't now so difficult to overcome.
But technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world.
Weapons and factories are destroying our planet and we need to realise that we have to use technology to improve our lives, while always trying to respect nature.
Recently I have been interested in musical shows, because I have never seen them in my country.
When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive to me.
So I went to London to see the show.
The worst thing was that the actor and actress were not the people who had been written about in the advertisement, because of that I was extremely disappointed.
So, I could not concentrate on the show.
How has modern technology changed your daily life? It could be difficult to feel how many things have been changed in our daily life.
But if you thought back to 10 years ago you could easily notice.
 As an advantage, the modern technology is developing toward convenience for humans.
However there is not only this advantage but there are also lots of disadvantages.
Although the mobile phone is very useful in our life, it might be harmful for our brains because of microwaves it can cause cancer or traffic accidents.
In addition, the side effects of artificial farm products also can't be ignored in our daily life.
So I would like to say that science and techology changed our daily life by giving us more convenience but it also could be dangerous.
I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: "Over the rainbow".
First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should have been one of the stars, instead there was a, to me, totally unknown actor.
To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start.
Your advertisement also failed to mention the fact that there were no discounts whatsoever and, finally, because of a shortage of staff, your restaurant was not open .
This event was not what I call "a perfect evening out", as your advertisement promised.
I feel entitled to compensation for this event.
I suggest a refund of the full price and I hope you are willing to take responsibility.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It didn't take long for my embarrassing story to get out in the open.
I asked myself how I could be so stupid, telling her my secret after all I had been going through to keep it to myself.
But now the story was out, I just started to accept it.
Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all.
Now I didn't need to go around worrying about it anymore.
At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared on my face.
I decided to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lesson.
That evening I went to her house.
I pretended to be totally miserable.
Pat didn't know what to do.
She apologised over and over again and I could really see that she was more than devastated.
Finally I smiled.
After hugging each other we promised never to tell others about our secrets.
Especially not if it has to do with failing all your exams....
A few days ago I went to the Circle theatre to see a musical show which is showing in your theatre now.
It made me very disappointed.
There are several reasons that I was not happy about the musical.
The first one I am going to complain about is the actor.
I could not see Danny Brook during the show.
There was a different actor instead of him.
Secondly, the times, it's on at 14.30 and 19.30 so I chose 19.30.
However, it was delayed and it started at 20.15.
Also, I had a student identification card to get a discount on the ticket price but discounts were unavailable.
The theatre restaurant was closed after the show, they said funds had run out.
First of all it's difficult say what exactly modern technology is now but I can say for sure it keeps developing and much better than the past.
Think about the computer, the speed of computers is much faster than before.
I couldn't even imagine our p.c could be that fast.
Also T.Vs, I guess that I would not have been able to watch colour T.V if I was born in 1960.
T.V colour only consisted of white and black.
Nowadays, technology keeps developing and better technology gives us an easier life.
Another example, the Internet.
This is a revolution which has changed our daily life.
You can do shopping on the Internet and it might be the fastest way to gather any information you would like to find.
However, it can also make our life very lazy.
This is one other important thing to remember.
People who have their own car, don't attempt to walk even if it is a short distance.
The improvement of technology can makes our life easy and on the other hand it can also make our life lazy.
I went to the circle theatre to see a musical show, OVER THE RAINBOW.
I really looked forward to the musical show, but it was a disappointing show.
Firstly, your advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it had different actors to my disappointment.
Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it was delayed until 20:15.
I had to wait 45 minutes, wasting time.
Thirdly, tickets were £10, £15 and £20, and I knew that these were available on discount, following the advertisement.
But it was impossible.
You said it would be a perfect evening, but it wasn't.
It was an upsetting evening.
So I ask you for money back.
I couldn't be satisfied with your theatre.
I hope you accept my suggestion.
In the hope that you understand me.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Pat tells others' secrets to everyone easily.
At first, when he had a girlfriend, they talked to each other frankly.
His girlfriend talked to him about everything.
That was because she trusted him.
But after they separated, he told his friends her secrets without thinking.
And when his friend, J, had a big problem, J asked Pat and his friend for help .
It was about his private problem, related to his friendships in the whole school.
If he had told everybody, J would have been blamed by the whole school.
But he forgot it and told his friends.
Actually it was not on purpose, but, sometimes, Pat someone's secrets.
Though it was not on purpose, it makes his friends leave him.
They can't trust him.
Pat also regrets his telling secrets.
It could be difficult for him to change himself.
It is like one of his bad habits.
Poor Pat, now he is blamed by everyone such as the people whose secrets he told to everybody.
It was a very unpleasant evening.
First of all, it had said in the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring in this show.
But someone else performed instead of him.
The other actor was very disappointing.
The second problem was the start of the show.
It began at 20:15 and not at 19:30! That's almost an hour later.
I had read that there would be some discounts available, but I received none of them.
The restaurant should have been open when I came out, but it was closed because of the time the show finished.
It wasn't a perfect evening at all.
I hope you can understand my disappointment and why I ask for my money back.
Nowadays, nobody can live without technology.
My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise.
The alarm on my radio wakes me up at half past six.
I get up, go to the kitchen and prepare myself something to eat in the microwave.
After breakfast I have to use my car to get to school.
Without my car I would always arrive late.
At school the computer has become an important new tool.
I use it to , to print some pictures or to surf the Internet.
After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends on the telephone.
Without technology I would get really bored.
Now, I lose less time and can use technology to enjoy myself.
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL THAT IS TAKING PLACE AT THE CIRCLE THEATRE.
I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE MUSICAL IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY.
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ WHO WAS STARRING.
IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'.
BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT IT WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED.
ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT 19.30 AND I WAITED FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED.
IN ADDITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET.
SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER.
TO SUM UP, I DID NOT HAVE A PERFECT EVENING.
I THINK THAT IT WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD.
TO CONCLUDE, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.
IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE WILL BE WEARING FASHIONABLE CLOTHES LIKE NOW.
PEOPLE WILL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR.
ON THE ONE HAND, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR FASHIONABLE CLOTHES.
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE WILL BE FEWER PEOPLE WHO WILL WEAR WHATEVER THEY LIKE.
NOWADAYS, PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORRIED.
ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES.
ON THE WHOLE, CLOTHES WILL NOT CHANGE.
IN MY OPINION, PEOPLE WILL ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO HOW THEIR PERSONALITIES DEVELOP AND THEY WILL GIVE UP WORRYING ABOUT WHAT THEY WEAR.
THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHAT THEY NEED AND TO BE HAPPY WITH IT.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to see Danny Brook, who I appreciate a lot and I was very disappointed that he wasn't there.
Besides, the actor who filled in for him was unknown and specially boring.
That is the reason I would like you to refund my money.
I hope you will take notice of this complaint .
I am looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
My daily life changed in some ways when I got the hang of using new technologies.
When I started work, I wrote everything I did on sheets of paper and if sometimes I made mistakes, I had to cross them out and it wasn't very well done.
I had to work out all my figures two times to make sure that my accounts were accurate.
Now, I enter data and I don't need to calculate my figures anymore, the work is done completely by computer and in addition there are no mistakes.
If I have to find a timetable, it is very useful to have the opportunity to see them on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! In the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for it.
But after a while you gain experience and you soon get used to this kind of research.
Another thing that has changed my daily life is the mobile phone.
As a matter of fact, if I am stuck in my car in traffic, I can call my boyfriend to tell him that I will be late.
Once, I saw an accident and I could call the police.
Sometimes the ring is annoying but, finally, the mobile phone is a great, handy object.
I am writing to complain about the musical "Over the Rainbow", which I went to see on the 16th of June.
Firstly, the actor was supposed to be Danny Brook, but he was not, it was another actor, who I have never seen before, so, as you can imagine, I was very disappointed.
Another complaint is about the time that the show started.
The advertisement said it started at 19:30, but it did not.
We had to wait 45 minutes.
It was terrible.
Now, about the tickets, there were different prices but there were no discounts, and because of this, many people could not see the show, especially students.
Finally, when the show finished, and I have to say, a bit late, I went to the theatre's restaurant to eat something but this place was closed because the chef had already gone.
As I have explained, it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back for the reasons that I mentioned above.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so Maria was very disappointed when she realised that Manuel knew the truth about the feelings that Maria had for him, in fact, she was so angry she could almost kill, but, she couldn't because Pat was her best friend.
Maria talked to Pat about the stupid thing that she had done, but Pat refused to apologise to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: to help Maria to get the man that she loved.
Maria was speechless, it was the first time that she didn't know what to do, so she decided to stop talking to Pat.
After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not able to go to school.
All her friends phoned her every day, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved.
Despite that, she was not sad.
One day, when Maria was sitting in her bedroom, someone knocked on the door.
It was Manuel.
He was worried about her.
Maria was nervous, but, for the first time, she could talk to him as she never had before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person in the world.
She had her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back; after all, everything happened because of her.
Yesterday I went to "The Circle Theatre" to see the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW".
I'm very disappointed with this evening.
The first thing was that it started 45 minutes late.
And when it finally started, it wasn't Danny Brook who performed.
There was a different actor and he was really bad.
You should have informed us before that you'd changed the actor.
On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't.
After the show I wanted to drink something in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started too late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday.
So I ask you sincerely for my money back because it wasn't a perfect evening out.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I told her that my parents are getting divorced and that I will move to Chicago with my mother.
We are in High School together in California and this is our last year.
We wanted to study biology here in Los Angeles with some other friends but now my plans have changed and I have to leave them.
In your advertisement it said that in the main roles there would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Danny wasn't there! Instead there was a different actor whose performance was disappointing.
The show was supposed to begin at 19.30, but in fact it started at 20.15 and we had to wait for 45 minutes .
Some about the tickets: your advertisement said that discounts were available so we didn't have money with us.
When we arrived, the administration of the theatre said that discounts are not available.
Finally, when we decided to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, it was closed (all the staff went home because the show lasted 45 minutes longer).
For all these reasons, I would like you to give me at least half of my money back.
, Mrs.
(...).
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It was May 15 - our English teacher's birthday.
Marion was our favourite school teacher and we decided to organise a surprise for her.
A month before we began to prepare for this day and we all agreed to keep it a secret.
We had been discussing for a long time what to give her.
There were a lot of proposals from the students: one suggested a vase, another a good pen (he said it would be useful for the teacher).
But we decided to buy a picture, because she had always told us about art galleries with great excitement.
We chose the best one with a beautiful nature scene in it.
The day before her birthday we had an English lesson, and after the lesson Pat went up to Marion and told her about our surprise.
He was bad-tempered and envious and he didn't want everything to be all right, and besides he didn't like Marion.
That's why he disappointed Marion and us.
In the advertisement you said "Danny Brook" is the actor but it wasn't him.
It was somebody else.
I went to see the show because I like Danny Brook.
The person that appeared instead of Denny was not very good.
The show was supposed to start at 19.30 pm but it started at 20.15 pm.
It was very late.
We had to wait nearly an hour.
Staff did not tell us why it started late.
When I bought tickets, they at all.
I asked them about discounts because I read about them in the advertisement.
They ignored me.
We bought tickets without a discount.
I don't know whether they offered a discount to somebody else or not.
After the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed.
It closed at 11 pm.
It was not our fault that we went in after 11 pm.
The show finished late.
The restaurant should stay open until the show finishes.
It was not a perfect evening at all.
Could I please have my money back? It was £60 for the tickets.
I was very disappointed about this.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She is one of my friends at school.
She is very nice, clever, polite and friendly.
Everybody loves her.
If you have any problems, she can give you some suggestions.
If you want her to keep them secret, do not tell her.
She cannot keep secrets.
This is her bad point.
She always tells someone else about it.
Last week, Tim told Pat about his serious problem.
He wanted Pat to keep it between them but Pat did not keep her promise.
She told us about it.
When Tim found out that we knew his problem and we tried to help him, he was very angry with Pat.
He won't talk to Pat at all.
Basically, Tim did not know that Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
She does not know .
We are so worried about her future.
She has not a lot of friends because of this .
I was on a week's holiday in London and I went to the theatre to see "Over The Rainbow".
I must say that your musical show was very disappointing for me.
"Over The Rainbow" looked very interesting in your advertisement but the organisation and show were almost terrible.
First of all, I expected to see Danny Brook, but I saw a different actor and that was a big disappointment for me.
Secondly, the show started at quarter past eight.
This is a forty-five-minute delay.
Moreover, there were not any discounts and all of the tickets were the same price.
"Visit our theatre restaurant after the show".
That was cruel, because I was very hungry after the show.
At the end of this letter I would like to ask if you can refund my money.
I will be very pleased if you can do so.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
The twentieth century was a century of inventions.
Some of them are big and some of them are small, but they affect our lives in the same way.
Technology makes our life different than the life of people, for example, living in the nineteenth century.
Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better.
Often people do not see how it affects our lifestyle.
Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers, stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day.
They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant.
Transport and communication would not exist without cars, trains, planes and telephones.
We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors.
Without these, and newspapers of course, knowing our world could be hard.
On the other hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers.
Finally, we must mention modern medicine.
It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases.
I would like to have some information about the advertisement for the show.
First of all, why did the show begin at 20:15, not at 19:30 as indicated in the advertisement.
I waited almost one hour to see the show, and what happened with the actor? I came to that show only to see him and when the actor appeared, it was another one.
There is more! Where were the discounts that I should have had? I was very disappointed with that! After the show my son wanted to eat some biscuits and when I saw the restaurant closed, I gave up.
I told my son that we'll never come back here again.
The restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity.
You should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
I was totally unsatisfied with the theatre and I would like to have my money back if that's possible.
I am writing what I think the kind of clothes people will wear 100 years from now will be like.
As we see, the fashions are changing every hour.
People are inventing new kinds of clothes and people are buying and wearing different clothes.
It is difficult to say how people will be wearing clothes 100 years from now.
In each country, each people wears different kinds of clothes, for example, people in Brazil wear shorts, T-shirts or go without them; in Saudi Arabian they wear strange clothes, if you analyse them from the point of view of someone who doesn't live in Saudi Arabia.
I'm quite sure that people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes .
My name is Anne Singler and I have watched the musical "Over the rainbow" in the Circle Theatre.
I'm writing to you because I wasn't pleased with the show! In your advert for the musical you promised the newest and best musical show, but it wasn't.
First I was very disappointed about the price of the ticket because I expected to pay a lower price than £20 for my six-year-old daughter.
Then the show actually started at 20:15 and not at 19:30! I was quite bored, sitting in my chair and waiting for the beginning of the show.
For me the most disappointing problem was that the star Danny Brook wasn't there.
My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr.
Brook as an actor in your musical because he is one of his greatest fans.
The actor who acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr.
Brook.
After the show, which wasn't really the best I have ever seen, my family and I wanted to get some snacks in the theatre restaurant.
When we arrived at the restaurant we realised that it was closed because the cook was ill.
After this last we went home with only bad memories of this evening.
So I want to ask you to give me my money back because I think I would have been better off spending my money on something else.
One day her best friend Sally told her that she had betrayed her boyfriend.
Pat was really shocked to hear this but she had to promise Sally to keep quiet.
Pat really liked chatting about others and so she wasn't able to keep quiet about Sally's secret.
She told it to her boyfriend Paul.
After that Paul turned white in the face, he was pale like a wall and it seemed that he was very nervous.
Pat couldn't understand Paul's reaction and so she didn't worry about it.
My name is Sandre Atos, I am writing to you because last weekend I went to the theatre you manage, to see what was called "London's newest and best musical show".
However, I must say, it was quite the opposite.
First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced by a disappointing actor.
Besides that the spectacle was meant to start at 19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15.
In addition to all this, the promised discounts on the tickets were not offered.
Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed.
Sir, I couldn't believe it, everything that was in the advertisement was a lie.
I was told that I would have a perfect evening, though instead of that I had a terrible one.
That's why I am writing to ask for some money back; I believe I have this right.
Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that has ever happened in their lives.
However, since I was a child I have noticed that, except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought me more disadvantages than advantages.
I still remember the day the television came to my house.
I was only seven, everybody was excited about the new "toy", however, what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned out to rule our lives.
Unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was among us.
Before TV, we used to spend our nights playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other.
Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas.
On the other hand, due to scientific developments, I am getting better, recovering from asthma.
In addition to this it is wonderful not to have to wait too long to eat, thanks to the invention of microwaves.
Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological devices, but a very happy and united family.
I had a very disappointing evening last Saturday.
I had everything planned; my family and I were coming to watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disastrous.
Firstly there was no discount available, though you promised one in your advertisement, so even my 6-year-old son was charged the adult price.
Then everything was going well until the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30.
Well it didn't.
It started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15.
And by the way may I ask you how up-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the advert saying the starring actor was Danny Brook, it wasn't.
It was another actor and one I had never heard of.
That was a disappointment for my whole family.
In fact all the audience were very disappointed.
Anyway the show was nowhere near as good as it was meant to be and it was definitely worse than I had expected it to be.
I didn't enjoy it at all so I was relying on the food to fill me up and relieve some of my stress.
So as soon as the show was over we walked out and followed all the signs for about 5 minutes, desperately searching for your restaurant, our stomachs rumbling for food.
Finally we found the place.
The location is far too far away and, what would you know?, the place is closed for restoration, and it has been for two weeks! And your booking staff didn't know this obviously as they took our booking, with no hesitation whatsoever.
They even gave us a table number.
What kind of an organisation do you call this, sir/madam? You don't understand how disappointed and angry I was that night.
I was expecting a perfect night out but I came face to face with a total nightmare.
And I am demanding a refund.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
In fact he was one of the principal busybodies of his neighbourhood and his school so not a lot of people in his school liked him.
This was .
Another bad thing about this school was that there were different types of students that formed groups.
Some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously.
They gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
This went on and on, got more and more serious, but it was so secret that the teachers didn't notice.
One day one of those groups decided to have a party and although Pat wasn't in their group they invited him too but told him very firmly to keep it a secret, especially from the other groups.
But Pat was so excited that he forgot all about the secret and told all of his best mates.
And the word spread like wildfire and by the end of the day virtually everyone knew about this party.
But luckily for Pat the word did not return to the group having the party.
Everyone in the year was annoyed, but not with Pat, oh, no! With the group having the party.
No one could do anything about it, except a few psycho groups.
Some of the more serious ones decided to raid this party, just for the fun and meanness of it.
The time had come.
The groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike.
They had water bombs and water pistols at the ready.
They started charging down the field towards the fire and once in range everyone threw their balloons as far as they could.
They all exploded with loud splashes.
The group having the party thought this was a serious attack and started throwing stones back and shooting everyone with BB guns.
Lots of People were injured and even more were suspended the next day at school, when the Headmaster found out what had happened.
Pat received no punishment at all and he wasn't blamed for anything by his teachers or friends.
But he felt awful because he knew that all this had happened because of him.
I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I saw last Sunday, in the evening.
Firstly, I was very disappointed because of the actor, who was different from the one advertised in your advertisement, Danny Brook was not starring.
Secondly, I was ready at 19:30 , as you had advertised, and I had to stay waiting in front of the theatre until 20:15, when the show finally began.
Worst of all, at the end of the Musical, I went to your Theatre Restaurant, in order to have dinner, because I had left home without eating and so I was hungry at that time.
So, you can't believe how disappointed I was when I saw that it was closed, with no explanation.
Finally, I would like to tell you that I am asking for my money back, because I had a totally unpleasant evening, completely different from what you had promised in your advertisement.
First of all, modern technology has changed my daily life in the last five years more quickly than in ancient times, or even than a decade ago.
I came to notice the difference at work, since all tasks were performed on the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine.
At that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge.
First I came to write letters and articles, next I learned several computer games.
When I learned how to use the Internet, I haven't stopped until now.
On balance, I can affirm that I couldn't without this modern technology today.
My life wouldn't be the same without this progress.
I am writing to you to complain about ,,Over the Rainbow", the musical show which took place in The Circle Theatre several weeks ago.
First of all, the advertisement for the shows provided absolutely FALSE information about the cast.
Danny BROOK, who should have appeared according to your advertisement, was replaced by another actor and that disappointed me.
The show should start at 19.30.
However, the audience waited for forty-five minutes.
Also, in the advertisement you mentioned discounts which were not provided.
The theatre restaurant was closed that evening and I did not receive an explanation why.
On the whole, the evening was boring and disappointing.
Based on everything listed above, I would like to get the £10 which I paid back.
The ticket for the show is enclosed.
New technologies have become a part of our lives.
There are a lot of arguments about whether this influence is negative or positive.
Nevertheless, it has affected every person and hopefully in a good way.
Personally, I consider modern technologies to be a positive innovation.
Using a microwave oven or vacuum cleaner saves me a lot of time.
A computer is extremely helpful with writing reports and essays.
And, of course, I cannot forget about cars and planes that take us to all parts of the Earth.
However, many people insist that new technologies affect people in a negative way.
I would prefer seeing my father talking to his family instead of staring at .
But also I am not able to imagine my life without this nice way of receiving news with .
Counting the pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points to and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway.
A modern girl or boy is already unable to imagine life without them.
I am writing to complain about a show that I saw at your theatre.
First of all, Danny Brook was supposed to act , but he was replaced by another actor.
This situation made me feel very disappointed.
Secondly, the show should have started at 19:30 p.m., and it began forty-five minutes late.
Moreover, when I went to buy the tickets no discounts were available.
Furthermore, I wanted to have a coffee after the show, but when I tried to get to the theatre restaurant, it was closed.
A police officer who was there told me that the manager of the restaurant was ill and that he wouldn't allow anyone to open it.
For all these reasons, I want you to refund the cost of the tickets and to send the money to my house.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Her school classmates were going to throw their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise for her.
They organized everything.
The event was going to take place in the garden at Paula's house.
Some of them were in charge of bringing music.
The others had to bring food.
That afternoon they arrived at Paula's house to decorate the place.
Balloons and coloured lights were put in all the trees.
A table was laid with a lot of delicious food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it.
Some time later everything was finally prepared.
The garden was wonderful.
The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise.
But things didn't happen as they had planned.
Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this.
During my stay in London I went to your theatre to see this show.
Though it said in your advertisement the show stars Danny Brook there was a different actor on stage.
That is not the only problem.
The show was meant to start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
You promised that there would be discounts, but when I arrived, I found out that they were not available.
I wanted to go to your restaurant.
I invited a friend of mine and promised her that we would go there.
And what I found out was your restaurant was closed.
You promised that if we went to your show we would have a perfect evening.
Everything was just the reverse.
I am very disappointed.
That is why I am asking you for compensation.
It happened at the end of the school year.
My class was going to a nightclub and I wanted to go there too.
I asked my parents if I could go, but they did not let me do that.
I tried to persuade them, said that nothing would happen to me, promised to do all the housework.
But all they did was tell me that I am to young for that and I can go there only when I am 20 years old.
I had such a desire to go to the disco that I decided to go even without my parents' permission.
I told my secret to my best friend, Pat.
But she told it to every kid in school, even the teachers heard it.
It happened that one of the teachers told my parents about it.
In the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks.
I understood that I must keep my secrets and not tell anybody, even my best friend.
First of all, the actor was different from the one mentioned in your advertisement.
I mean he was not Danny Brook.
Secondly, about forty-five minutes, because it started at 20:15.
.
Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount on your ticket price with my ID card.
Besides this, the theatre restaurant closed early.
As soon as the show ended, I went there to have a dessert.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Griffin, who is a teacher, wasn't surprised at our preparation.
It was very close to his birthday, so we made a decision to hold a small party for him.
She had just been studying with us for three weeks.
She is not talkative, but kind and reserved.
However, at this party she came to she was responsible for preparing food.
As far as we knew, she was good at cooking.
While she was choosing vegetables at a market, she came across him.
When he asked her, 'Why do you choose carefully?', she answered without thinking.
That caused the secret to be disclosed.
We didn't blame her, because we knew that she didn't intend to act like that.
Although he wasn't surprised, he was glad and pleased with our party.
Anyway, Happy Birthday to Griffin, again.
I am writing to complain about your show which was advertised in the last edition of "Plays".
I am afraid that reality had nothing common with the things I expected to find.
First of all, the prices weren't .
Then, I expected the show to start on time, but it turned out that I had to wait 45 minutes.
Moreover, when the play started at last, I couldn't look at the actors.
In particular I was disappointed by Danny Brook, who made me nervous with his lack of talent.
According to your advertisement, there was an opportunity to have dinner in your restaurant, but I was surprised when I found it closed.
After that, I should also mention that this evening was dull, boring and the worst in my life.
I am looking forward to hearing from you and I insist that you refund my money at once.
Clothes are part of each culture and one of those things which express our taste and personality.
People spend a lot of money to buy something extraordinary, feel comfortable and stand out.
They come up with many ideas but it can't last for a long time.
Nowadays, it's getting obvious that designers sell only , and significant changes don't turn up.
Styles mix, colours and shapes come back from the past, and only the fabrics are different.
People look for something new but it is not so easy to be creative all the time.
Teenagers are bored with casual fashion and their parents laugh at them because of the fact they wear ordinary clothes.
That's why I believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid boredom.
I am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free.
There won't be any problem with being up-do-date.
As was previously stated, I am convinced that the reality will turn out to be a paradise where the most important thing will be the body and the purity of our soul.
Although the show was supposed to be London's newest and best musical show, I was rather disappointed with it.
Firstly, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook and Tina Truelove on the stage.
However, you changed actors without informing the audience.
As if this were not enough, the show was forty-five minutes late.
Your leaflet was rather misleading on this subject.
According to your leaflet, tickets were supposed to be a bit cheaper, but I was refused a discount.
You can imagine how disappointed I was to have such an imperfect evening.
I demand a full refund or I will be forced to take this matter further.
Recently, we had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives.
My life has also changed as a result of modern technology.
Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, and the Internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to before.
My father is a sailor and I see him only four times a year.
But thanks to mobile phones I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean.
I also enjoy shopping on the Internet.
This way I don't have to be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes.
In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist.
Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.
However, I can see some disadvantages of technological progress.
First of all, I spend too much time indoors playing on the computer or watching TV.
I know that if I want to keep fit and stay healthy, I must take up some sport.
Moreover, modern technology has made our environment more polluted.
That's why we should ban cars from city centres, and close down factories which produce too much waste.
Although modern progress has made our life easier, it may also be harmful.
We should all be aware of these consequences of modern technology and use it wisely.
I went to the Circle Theatre to see the musical show "Over The Rainbow".
Unfortunately, I had a very disappointing evening, because very little of what was in the advertisements was provided.
Firstly, we were informed that Danny Brook was starring but a different actor was starring in the show and he was really disappointing.
Secondly, in the advertisement it said that the show was to start at 19:30.
However, it started at 20:15, almost an hour late.
Thirdly, it said that discounts were available but we were again frustrated, seeing they were not available.
Finally, although we were informed that the theatre restaurant would be open after the show, it was closed because the show had started late.
As you can see, most of the in the advertisements were not provided.
We did not have "a perfect evening" as it said, actually we had an evening full of the theatre's mistakes and were extremely disappointed.
I think it will be better for your theatre's reputation to give at least some of my money back.
If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic alarm clock wakes me up in the morning.
I go to school by underground.
When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave.
In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat on the Internet..." There is no sentence without electronic devices.
I wonder what I could do without them...
I don't go out with my friends or read books.
I have friends on the Internet and can learn anything while surfing it.
I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world.
When I look at my life, I can understand I am dependent on the machines.
My daily life is programmed to the virtual world I created.
Modern technology has changed my life completely.
I'm writing to you because of the musical show "Over the rainbow", which I saw on Friday the 16th of June in your theatre.
There are several points I have to complain about which meant the evening was not nice at all.
First the show started much later than was advertised.
Instead of half past seven the show started at quarter past eight.
I couldn't go to get any refreshment for two reasons, the first one is that there was no information about how long the start of the show was going to be late by.
The second reason is that the theatre restaurant was closed for the next two months because of building plans.
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I realised that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went to the show, had been replaced by another actor, who couldn't sing half as well as Brook.
On your tickets information is written that discounts are available, when I asked at the ticket office I couldn't get any discount for being a student.
To conclude, the evening in your theatre and the show was very disappointing and not like the one promised.
For these reasons I want to ask you for my money, £25, back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
He didn't want to say what Sarah had just told him, it just came of his mouth, when he talked to James.
"Sarah has won in a quiz show?" James was more than just interested, he wanted to know what she had won.
But Pat made a promise not to tell anybody about the quiz show and he had already told enough.
After one hour the whole class had heard about Sarah's secret.
Everybody was interested in what she had won but nobody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them.
Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around talking and whispering started.
Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him, "Did you tell anybody about our secret?" Pat told her everything.
Sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I am writing to make a complaint about your theatre and the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
Firstly, in your advertisement you said that Danny Brook has a part in the show, but there was a different actor in the play.
This fact disappointed me a lot.
Secondly, it said in the advertisement that the show begins at 19.30, however, it started at 20.15.
According to the advertisement, discounts should have been available but, in fact, I was refused a discount.
It was very for me.
In addition to this, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was too late (the show did not start on time).
Everybody who came to its doors had to go to the other restaurant in a bad mood.
I could have this if the musical show had been marvellous, but it was not even quite interesting.
Furthermore, I would like you to return my money.
You promised me a perfect evening out, but it was one of the most terrible in my life.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She was a 25-year-old secretary in a big company.
Her boss was a rich man, really rich.
His name was Timson White.
He was one of the most famous people in the city, but he wasn't honest with his clients.
Pat had worked for him for two years.
Certainly she knew a lot of secrets.
One of them was about her boss's private life: he had an illegitimate son.
Timson's wife, who was good-looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment.
Timson was really shocked! He couldn't even say a word.
He tried to think who could have told his wife .
Of course, only one person knew this apart from his best friends.
This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check up.
I write to you because last Friday I had a very disappointing evening at your theatre.
I went there because I had read a about the musical show "Over the rainbow", but a lot of information was wrong.
Last week I was in London with my friends and we decided to go to the theatre to see the famous Danny Brook act.
I ask you if it is possible to have my money back, please, because I want to forget that expense.
Thank you.
Modern technology can't not transform our daily life.
The inventions of the aeroplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day.
It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and in a few minutes I can be on the other side of Lecce to play piano with my band, then I can go back home when I want, listening to the news about what has happened around the world on my car radio.
So I have many more interesting things to do in my life.
Sadly, there is also a negative aspect.
Sometimes, the computer replaces real relationships between people.
In fact, many boys spend several hours in front of their computer and forget that out of their houses there are their friends....
I am writing to complain about the Musical Show I saw last week.
There is some disagreement between your advertisement and the show which I saw at the Circle Theatre.
First of all, I would like to state that you gave the wrong starting and finishing times.
The Musical started at 20:15 not at 14:30 - as you had stated.
It was very surprising for me and I had a lot of trouble with getting back home at night - when it finished.
Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook on the stage.
He is my favourite artist and I went there mainly because of him.
This made me really disappointed - he wasn't performing there.
Finally, you had claimed I would have a perfect evening out.
Unfortunately, I can't say that.
I am very disappointed and I would like to ask you for my money back.
I think this could be the only right way for me to forget about my uninteresting evening.
I would appreciate it if you could consider my complaint.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Try to imagine the wide, colourful street with many fantastic cars and large shiny shops.
Try to think about people in weird black and grey clothes .
It isn't a film, it isn't even a picture from mysterious books.
It's a REALITY, it's the FASHION OF THE FUTURE...
People have been wearing almost everything, during more than 2000 years of their living on Earth.
Everything has changed: style, colour, quality.
Fashion.
Their clothes were always strictly connected with their lifestyle, climate and money.
We saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats - which until now have been the main point of many fashion .
What can we suspect then? What hasn't been invented now? I will tell you - black and grey.
These are two powerful colours, which will be expanding for the next 100 years.
The climate is changing, so we will have only two seasons.
And we will need only two colours: grey for hot days and black for cold ones.
Women will wear only skirts and dresses but men will be strictly connected with trousers.
I hope there will be times when women will like again to be thought delicate and sensitive human beings.
Showing their figure, they would have the opportunity to show their sexuality.
But, don't forget, no exhibitionism! We have too many people around us, now.
And that will be a thing of the past.
The streets of the 21st century will be smart.
So, are you interested in that style? Do you agree with me? If not, you are very .
This fashion is coming, so think about it.
Grey and black - like the seasons, like people's characters, like all the night and dark surrounding us.
These are the colours of the FUTURE.
Recently, I had a week's holiday in London and during my stay, I went to your theatre to see "Over The Rainbow" and I was really disappointed.
In the advertisement, it said that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance in him.
Also, in the programme, the time of the show was written as 19:30, but it started at 20:15 and I missed the dinner I was going to have with my best friend in London.
Since I am a student and not as rich as Bill Gates, I was short of money and I was very pleased to hear that there were discounts available for the tickets; but I had to give the full price of the ticket, which I consider to be the fault of your theatre.
In addition to this, it was mentioned that your restaurant was open after the show, but it was not because there was no food to be served.
As you can understand, it was a dreadful time and I want my money back as a consolation for the disappointment I had.
Also, I use my computer and the Internet very much in order to find information, do my projects and communicate with my friends.
To talk to a friend from another city or country instantly online is really nice and exciting.
I do not have to wait for a letter for days and I gain so much time too.
On the other hand, because of being on computers so much, I cannot see my family and friends very much, even when we are in the same place.
It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker.
But despite this, I am very happy with the technological facilities in my daily life.
During my stay in London I decided to see a musical show called "OVER THE RAINBOW" but, unfortunately, I was very disappointed.
First, as I have read in your advertisement, Danny Brook should have starred in this show.
A different actor appeared, and I must say that he was very disappointing.
What is more, it was stated that I could get some discounts, but when I wanted to buy a cheaper ticket, it was impossible.
To sum up, I must say that this evening out was supposed to be perfect.
It was not, of course, so I would like to ask you for my money back, because some information placed in your advertisement about the musical was not true.
First, there are now a lot of things that most people use at home.
For example: a fridge, a cooker or just electricity.
We couldn't imagine our life without them.
Secondly, thanks to technology, there are many ways of travelling today.
We produce cars, trains and planes which are better and better.
What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment.
It can really help a lot to cure people.
Maybe there will be a cure for AIDs or cancer soon.
On the other hand, modern technology has some disadvantages.
The main one is the ozone hole that affects all the people in the world.
The second is nuclear weapons and the many wars in which modern equipment is used.
To sum up, as far as I am concerned, modern technology has changed my life completely.
On the one hand, it helps me a lot in daily life, but on the other, I'm afraid of the future every day.
Last week, during my holiday in London, I had the opportunity to see the show "Over the Rainbow" at the Circle Theatre.
That is why I am writing this letter; to inform you about the problems I had.
First of all, the tickets were too expensive.
I was told that there were some discounts for students, but the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me full price.
The day of the show, we got to the theatre at 19:30.
But, due to some technical problems, it began at 20:15.
Second, I was really disappointed when I found out that Danny Brook, the best actor I have ever known and the reason for my deciding to see the show, was not going to be performing.
Third, the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef did not show up.
I was really looking forward to eating at that place.
In conclusion, I would appreciate it if you could, please, send me my money back because I did not have the perfect evening that I expected.
Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets.
Sally, her best friend, had told her what had been happening at her house for the last two months.
Pat knew something was wrong because she had known Sally since they were five years old, but she did not why she was acting so strangely.
Sally did not want to tell anybody about her problem, but she knew she could trust Pat.
So Sally started to talk.
She had seen her stepfather hitting her mother every time he was drunk.
She didn't want to tell the teachers at school or any other person because she was afraid that if her stepfather found out about it, he would get mad and hit her, or even worse, kill her mother.
However, she needed to tell somebody.
One morning somebody knocked at the door at Sally's house.
It was the police.
Sally was so scared, and at the same time mad at Pat because she knew the only person who could have told the police was her best friend.
But she knew that Pat did it because she loved her and was afraid something horrible would happen to her or to her mother.
About two weeks ago, I went to London for a week's holiday.
While there I saw your advertisement for the show "Over the rainbow" and decided to go.
I was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; I was then very disappointed to see that Danny Brook had been replaced by someone else.
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you for a refund for the amount I paid, or part of it.
You will find the receipt enclosed.
Modern technology is affecting my daily life a lot, I can even say it has changed it.
I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail via the Internet and the person receives it within seconds.
I don't need to go to the stores anymore if I don't want to: I can just stay at home and buy almost everything through it: books, video tapes, clothes and even groceries.
I also have the opportunity of making new friends: I can connect to a special site which will enable me to virtually meet people.
I am writing to you because yesterday I went to the musical "Over the Rainbow" and I had a bad evening.
First of all, in the advertisement it says that the stars were .
Also in the advertisement it says that the show would begin at 19.30 and it started at 20.15; that meant that I had to cancel a date that I had at 21:00, because I couldn't make it.
If you put on a show you must be on time.
Finally, you were supposed to have the restaurant open, and it wasn't, because they didn't have electricity to cook, so they closed it.
Modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways.
First of all, at work; computers are really amazing, you only need to turn one on and start to write; your work is neater and you work faster.
It has also changed my free time; they have invented great games like play station, and you can have a really good time playing with your friend.
In the old days, on a rainy day you couldn't play because most games were played outside the house but now with modern technology you can do many things in your house.
Another aspect is that domestic appliances - microwaves, washing machines - make life easier.
In my opinion technology has made living easier, more fun and more comfortable.
I have been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show at the Circle Theatre.
When I saw the advertisement for the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see "Over the Rainbow", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about them.
First of all, when I bought the tickets I got no discount, and in the advertisement it was stated that people would get some, and when I got into the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun.
Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement.
There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones.
Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late.
I did not have a perfect night at all, so I would like to ask if I can have my money back.
Please give me an answer.
Thank you for reading this letter.
We cannot deny that technology has changed our lives.
Nowadays, we no longer need to spend hours cooking, for example: we just put some frozen food in the microwave, and in a few minutes our meal is ready.
We can communicate with people in distant countries in real time, using the Internet.
There are a lot of other examples of how technology has changed people's lives.
I could not do my school projects without using a computer, because I have to do some statistical analysis that I could not do with a calculator.
Also, I can communicate with some friends who live in other countries by e-mail almost every day, and I save some money because I pay for a local call, and not for an international call.
Another thing which is very useful for me is my mobile phone, because people can talk to me whenever they need to, but on the other hand it is very unpleasant to be interrupted by the phone when I am in an important meeting.
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MUSICAL SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW" WHICH WAS PERFORMED LAST WEEK.
YOUR ADVERTISING LEAFLET WAS COMPLETELY INACCURATE.
IT SAID THAT DANNY BROOK WAS ACTING BUT, WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS ANOTHER GUY ON STAGE.
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING, SPECIALLY FOR ME WHO IS A GREAT FAN OF DENNY.
THAT'S NOT ALL! IT STARTED FORTY-FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE RIGHT TIME AND WE HAD TO WAIT OUTSIDE THE THEATRE.
THE TICKETS WERE SUPPOSED TO INCLUDE DISCOUNTS BUT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING THEM TOLD ME THAT I MUST BE WRONG, THEY NEVER GIVE ANY DISCOUNTS TO ANYONE.
AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED.
ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS.
I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS.
FOR ALL THESE REASONS MY EVENING WAS TERRIBLE AND I WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE AT LEAST PART OF MY MONEY BACK.
SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER.
JUST FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY.
THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT.
IN MY CASE, I'M COMPLETELY INTEGRATED WITH THEM, IN ALMOST EVERYTHING I DO I USE THIS TECHNOLOGY.
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO READ BOOKS, WRITE, LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND, NOWADAYS, YOU CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS USING A COMPUTER.
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL TOOLS THAT MEN HAVE INVENTED.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO LOTS OF THINGS AND TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE TOO USING A PC.
I SPEND MOST OF MY DAY IN FRONT OF ONE OF THOSE MACHINES, STUDYING, RESEARCHING, PLAYING AND TALKING TO FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE WORLD.
THIS TECHNOLOGY ALSO HAS IT'S BAD ASPECT.
IT DISTANCES YOU FROM PEOPLE; YOU BECOME ISOLATED FROM TRUE RELATIONSHIPS BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT WHEN YOU GET USED TO THIS.
I bought a ticket for the "Over the Rainbow" musical show last Saturday, but I felt very disappointed with it.
It was announced that there would be discount tickets available, but there were not.
The show should have started at 19.30, but it was delayed forty-five minutes.
And, worst of all: Danny Brook was not on stage.
He was replaced by a novice actor who gave a very disappointing performance.
Last, the theatre restaurant was closed because there was a serious leak in a pipe and the kitchen was flooded.
I think there are sufficient reasons for giving my money back.
I just wanted to have a pleasant evening out and I could never have imagined that there would be so many problems.
I really expect that you will consider my arguments and pay me back the value of the ticket, as soon as possible.
Several technological advances in the past five years have changed my daily life.
Nowadays, I feel entirely linked to these innovations, and I would find it hard to live without them.
The Internet is certainly the most obvious of all these innovations.
Information is spread quickly and you can access in minutes a wide range of data, which would take a much longer time if it had to be found by traditional means.
For a shy person, like me, the Internet has another attraction: the opportunity of knowing people and making friends worldwide.
It's very exciting.
Currently, I exchange e-mails with dozens of people all over the country.
A cellular phone can be inconvenient sometimes, but it can be very useful in certain situations: when your car has broken down on the road, when you need to be found anywhere and at any time (if you are a doctor, a lawyer or a journalist, for instance), and so forth.
Modern technology has created other conveniences: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait in a big queue to be attended by the teller, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.
I'm writing to complain about an evening I spent in your theatre seeing a musical show.
According to your brochure, it was supposed to be the perfect evening out; instead of that I had a very disappointing evening.
Firstly, the actors weren't those announced.
Indeed, instead of Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, we had poor actors.
As for the time, the show was supposed to begin at 19.30 whereas in reality it began at 20.15.
Likewise, there were no discounts available.
To end, instead of being open, the restaurant was closed for renovation.
Because of all these inconveniences, I ask you for a total refund.
I'm sure you will accept my request; if not I intend to take legal action against your company.
You may contact me at my home address whenever you wish.
So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important, because she trusted in him, immediately he went to see one of his friends to tell him the secret.
When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students in her class knew about what she had said just the day before to Pat.
So immediately she went to Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret.
After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up.
Because of his behaviour, Pat is now alone and nobody trusts him.
I am writing to complain about the musical show, Over the Rainbow, presented in your theatre on 15th of June.
I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to get a discount as I was a student.
However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had sold out.
I could not understand why but I still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook.
Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry after waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time.
Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so badly that I left the theatre before it finished.
Last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning.
I think it was definitely not the perfect evening guaranteed in your advertisement.
I look forward to having a full refund in the very near future as I did not enjoy it at all.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Now everybody in the class knew my mum was a cleaner and teased me for having that kind of mum.
I was so sad about it and did not forgive Pat even though she apologised thousands of times.
In fact, your musical show was attractive: actors, time, restaurant, discount tickets, and also the title! I started to be OK with "Your perfect evening out", certain I was not going to be deceived.
But everything was disappointing! First, as I am very fond of Danny Brook, I was surprised that he had totally changed his voice, face, and so on! It was not Danny on the stage! Second bad point: not being narrow-minded, I accept other actors..
but only if the show begins on time - it began at a quarter past eight .
The was reached when I saw the restaurant was closed for "holidays".
So I now need a "perfect - refund -" in replacement for your "perfect evening out".
I am writing to complain about the musical show which is called OVER THE RAINBOW.
I saw the show on the 17th of July.
Firstly, the advertisement claimed a discount ticket was available.
Although I have a student card for discounts I could not get any discount.
So I had to buy a normal ticket.
Secondly, I bought a second musical show ticket which started at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
As a result, I had to wait over one hour as I arrived there at 19:00.
Thirdly, your advertisement said I could see Danny Brook, who I adore, in the show.
When I turned up for the show, there was another actor instead of him.
I hope this matter will receive your prompt attention.
In recent years, mordern technology has been developing increasingly.
We get many advantages which improve our daily lives, on the other hand, we also get many disadvantages which could harm us.
In my opinion, the main advantage is the development of medical technology.
For example, if you were hurt seriously like cutting your leg off, the new medical technology could rebuild part of your body.
Another advantage is sharing information.
The more developed the technology is, the quicker and easier international networking is.
So at the same time many people can share some information even though they live in different countries.
In contrast, the technology can cause pollution.
By developing transport, we can get wherever we want to go easily, however it could cause serious air pollution like acid-rain and smog.
Also we should be careful as we could be watched by security cameras which have been combined with modern technology.
In conclusion, in two ways.
One is an advantage and the other is a disadvantage.
And it will change our lives, also in the future.
I'm writing this letter to you because during my stay in London I went to the theatre to see a musical , and I had a very disappointing evening.
Last Saturday I went to see "Over the Rainbow".
When I read the advertisement, I noticed that Danny Brook acted in this musical .
I liked him a lot.
When the show started forty-five minutes late, I realised that the main actor had been replaced.
That replacement really disappointed me.
Another problem was that I didn't get any discount, and I wasn't alone, we were five people.
Our idea after the show was to visit the theatre restaurant, but it was closed.
Nobody could give me an explanation.
I really had an awful evening.
Please send me a letter, with the explanations for all these problems that I have told you about.
Next time, be more careful with what you put in your advertisement.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
That night my parents went out, so I had to stay home with Pat.
I invited my best friends, and I asked Christian to bring some videos.
We left Pat in her room with those videos, and we went to the top of the house, the third floor.
Manuel had a farm, not so far from the town, where we could do whatever we wanted.
But what was the problem? We were too young to spend a whole weekend alone.
I thought of the idea of telling our parents that we had gone camping with the school.
We were all agreed.
We were going to spend a weekend alone, with nobody else, playing football, going to bed at the time we wanted, talking about girls.
It was perfect.
We were very calm, discussing the last details of our weekend, when we heard a noise that came from a room that was near us.
Manuel opened the door, and there she was, Pat with Ramiro's sister, listening to all our conversation.
I went to the Circle theatre last week on Monday and I would say that I had a very disappointing evening there.
To sum up, it wasn't a "perfect evening out".
I'd rather say that it was a catastrophe! And I am really sorry, but consequently I would ask you for some money back.
Thank you for considering my request.
Modern technology has completely changed my daily life, which has become more comfortable, and easier.
Another simple example is my mobile telephone; A few years ago, I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner, or other stuff like that.
Yet my hand phone is in my bag and I take it everywhere.
But I think the best technological invention which changed my life is the Internet - Thanks to it, I have a hundred friends all over the world and I know many different cultures.
All these examples are to show how technology could affect our lives nowadays.
In my opinion, modern technology is a great thing unless it is used to serve bad intentions.
I went to London last week for business and, loving theatre very much, I had promised my friend to give her, after work, a very good evening at your musical show: "Over the Rainbow".
I hope you will understand why my evening was detestable and you will give me back my money.
I attach to this letter my two tickets.
I had read a very good book about pirates and I know I have a very creative imagination.
my parents lived in a small village near wonderful countryside.
Like my heroes, I would have liked to live in a ship and decided to build something in a tree.
The highest tree near a river I have ever seen.
A peaceful place with a wonderful view.
With my friend Pat (I took him into my confidence) I started to work and my idea became real.
It was our fortress and every day we could improve it.
The tree was our ship and the river the sea.
We could play for hours and hours without seeing an adult or any other children from the village.
I liked it.
It was our secret, Pat and I.
A child's secret.
There were lots of fights between us and we were naughty like children can be with other children.
Last week I spent my holiday in London and I saw your musical "Over the rainbow' in the Circle Theatre and I was really disappointed.
When I read the advertisement for the show I was really excited but after the show I was not very happy because of the following problems.
The advertisement says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them.
The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but on this evening it started at 20.15.
The advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
It was really not a perfect evening for me, I was expecting a nice evening but in fact it was terrible.
Because of these problems I had I would like to ask for compensation, maybe to get my money back.
I hope you understand my complaints.
I hope you answer me soon.
In my opinion modern technology has not really changed my daily life a lot because I am just 20 years old and I used to play with a computer when I was young or wash my clothes in the washing machine.
I grew up in a world full of technology and for me the recent development in technology is not very great.
Of course, it changes, it became normal to have a mobile phone or frequently to use the computer and the Internet.
It becomes easier and easier to use the computer for everything.
You don't have to go to the shop to buy clothes or to the restaurant to order some food.
I can just switch on my computer and order everything.
Also I don't write letters anymore because I write e-mails to my friends.
They go quicker and it is easier for me.
But I think for my generation there is not a really big difference, in comparison to my grandparents who have real problems accepting these changes in modern technology.
Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years.
With reference to the advertisement published in the New Strait Times newspaper on the 22nd of MAY 2000, I, as a customer, who is a musical-show addict and a great fan of Danny Brook, who was said to be starring in the show, would like to complain about the presentation.
1.
First of all, I was really furious about watching a show starring a different actor, instead of Danny Brook, whose name was given in the advertisement.
Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than it was meant to start.
2.
.
However, I was very disappointed when I was told that there were not any discounts for the show.
3.
I also found out that the theatre restaurant was not open after the show due to .
I was really hungry after the show and was very unhappy.
Considering all the above points, I would like to ask for some money back.
I will consider taking this complaint to court if I do not receive an acceptable explanation from the theatre.
Thank You.
Fashion is one of the most popular topics people discuss .
However, things are recycled from time to time.
.
I imagine that people in the future, for example 100 years from now, will wear clothes for protection like people did in the past.
People in the past wore clothes to protect themselves from the cold air, hot weather and strong wind.
On the other hand, people in the future will probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and water, the harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which are the product of a developed and country.
I think people in the future will probably wear helmets with .
It is because of the increasing size of the population and the shortage of oxygen gas in the atmosphere.
They will also wear water-proof, ultra-violet-proof and other dangerous-liquid-proof clothes to protect themselves.
These clothes have to be made of something light, comfortable to wear and protective.
All the above ideas are needed to when wearing these specially designed clothes.
The future is the hope and the dream for everyone on the earth.
Therefore, I will suggest that we all to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation.
When I first heard about Over the Rainbow I was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when I heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity I ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening I ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why I am writing to you.
As I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had.
First, the actors that the Circle theatre publicised on their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
Another point that I want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and I am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
For the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important thing for me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best.
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
And I think it's the same for me, because when advances in technology, like computers, Internet, etc., were made, it changed my life as a high school student.
To answer the question: "How has modern technology changed my daily life?", I can confirm that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the Internet, because it was easier for me, and for everyone, to do your homework, , and, in fact, it was easier for me to search for information that in the past I would have to look up in a library.
But not everything about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a way, have become computers' and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
Technology, in fact, has meant an improvement regarding daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brains will become atrophied.
I'm writing to you to make a complaint about your musical show: " Over the Rainbow"...
Last week, I, my husband and our two children went to your theatre to have a good time, but we were so disappointed.
First of all, I don't think it's professional to change the principal actor at the last minute, the play should have been with Danny Brook, but it wasn't.
In addition to this, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30, more than 45 minutes late...
Moreover, there weren't any discounts available in your advertisement.
There was a restaurant, though it was closed for renovation, and 2 hours 30 without drinking or eating something was quite difficult for the children.
It should have been a perfect evening out, but it was the opposite.
That's why, I would be grateful if you could give me my money back.
I look forward to hearing from you in the very near future.
Every day, like everybody, I watch the TV, see the International news, listen to the radio, play games on my computer or communicate with American or Asian people without leaving my house.
It seems to be incredible, but it's normal for us..
we don't think that  less than a hundred years ago, none of that existed.
I will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing-up, before this, women spent a long time doing these tasks.
In addition to this, ...
And it has not ended.
I hope that in my thirties I'll go to Mars on holiday...
The scientists have ten years to find the solution...
I am writing to complain about the show "Over the Rainbow", which I saw at your theatre two weeks ago; as a matter of fact our evening turned out to be very disappointing.
First of all, I was really looking forward to the performance of the leading actor Danny Brook, but sadly he wasn't there, he was replaced by a different actor, who was rather disappointing.
Furthermore the show should have started at 19.30 but instead it began at 20:15, which was really unpleasant.
The advertisement promised us a perfect evening but it wasn't, so I would highly appreciate it if you could completely refund our tickets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets: he always wanted to know everything about everybody and afterwards, of course, he would give away all he knew, but one day he had some problems...
His best friend Paul couldn't put up anymore with Pat always revealing his secrets, so he decided to play a trick on him.
Since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told Pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' at the Circle theatre.
Firstly I want to tell you how disappointing that night was.
Everything in the advertisement for the show was untrue.
The actors I saw in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
I went at 19.30 and the show didn't begin until 20:15 so I had to wait a lot and I arrived late to a meeting I had after the show.
There were no discounts available for the tickets and the theatre's restaurant was closed after the show because it was too late.
So I want you to send me some money back for that unpleasant night.
So in a very few days all the College knew that me and my friends were the ones who had crashed the headmaster's car.
The headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometres away from the village until we could change his mind.
Marc, one of my friends, hit Mr.
Heyman with a bottle and he lost consciousness.
We put him in my car and we left him inside a closed room.
When he woke up he started shouting and we had to calm him down.
We took some photos of him naked and told him not to tell anybody about this because if he does we will hang the photos all around the village.
He accepted this and we let him go free.
It all began because he is a nasty person and he forced us to clean the college every day, a cleaner.
We needed to do something like that to make him change.
With this letter I want to explain to you some problems I had last week at your theatre with your show.
First of all, I want to introduce myself.
I'm Francesco Schein, I'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I was very upset because the show had many problems.
First the actor was changed and his replacement's performance was very poor and disappointing.
Then, the show began 45 minutes late, so we had to wait a very long time.
The advertisement said there were discounts available, which were not available.
Finally you said there was a Restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
I hope you understand your mistakes and I'm asking you for our money back.
I don't know if technology has totally changed my life, because I was born with it and I have learned about it since I was a little boy.
For example, I was born knowing that man has walked on the moon.
There are some machines which have helped in my development, and others which help me to make my life easier.
The computer for example makes communication much easier and faster than in times past, when everything was sent by normal mail, and it was weeks till it got to the right place.
There are other machines which are bad for the environment.
Many industries throw their contaminated air away, without cleaning it first.
Technology has to move further so it can solve problems such as pollution, so we can live better and longer.
I am writing to you to explain what my experience was like in the theatre last Friday.
I did not expect all the problems that I had.
Firstly, I would like to say that the actor who played was not the same one that I read about in the advertisement.
Secondly, the show began forty-five minutes late and nobody told me what had happened.
Thirdly, I did not get any kind of discount when I paid although in the advertisement it was written that I would.
Finally, , I would like to get back the money that I paid because the show was not what you promised in the advertisement.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I think when you tell a secret you must be sure that you have chosen the best person to keep it.
In your life you will meet a lot of people and you should choose your friends.
When I was a child my friends were my classmates , especially my neighbours.
In the summers I was always playing with them on the street.
When I was fourteen years old some things changed.
I preferred riding a motorbike with the people who studied with me in the Institute.
But, until you are twenty years old you choose your best friends.
When you go to university you are a person who can begin to make good friends.
You have a chance to meet people and now you have an opportunity to select good friends.
You must select well if you want to have very good friends.
For these reasons, I think that you should know the person well you want to tell a secret to and keep it.
While we were waiting for the show to start, we were thinking of going to the restaurant.
However, it was closed the whole evening, because of some work being done to it.
But the invention that I'm most thankful for is the computer and the Internet! Thanks to them, I can easily communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England.
It's so quick and not too expensive either.
To use the mobile phone, by the way, is very expensive.
I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends.
So, I start every day by switching on my mobile phone, to see if there are any more SMS messages before I go to the library to check my e-mail and that's just the beginning of the day...
First of all, the play started 45 minutes late.
I felt so angry about that.
And discounts were not available (nobody explained the reason why).
I'm sure you will understand the reasons why I want my money back.
If you can't do that, we will accept tickets to go to another play.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
And Lorca knew it.
But Pat was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
It's a story of a crime of passion.
Let me explain it.
When Jim's wife knew she got a gun and killed her husband.
Then, she cried and cried, holding him.
(If she hadn't done it, Lorca's father would have done the same).
It was a shock for Lorca.
She jumped into the river and killed herself two days later.
I am writing regarding our visit to the Circle Theatre on the 17th June.
When we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that this would be a perfect evening out.
There were in our opinion two reasons for that, our favourite actor Danny Brook and the opportunity to visit your theatre restaurant afterwards.
However, the evening was very disappointing.
Firstly, Danny Brook was not acting, there was another, unknown actor and he was not good.
Secondly, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but did not start until 20.15.
Thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available, but they were not.
Furthermore the restaurant was closed because of a water leak.
I am therefore asking for compensation for our disappointing evening and hope we can reach a solution as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
It didn't take more than one day before everyone knew about my decision.
I had thought about it for many years but never been able to realise my dreams.
This year I had the opportunity to make my dreams come true.
However, I wasn't sure if my decision was right and therefore I decided to discuss it with Pat.
Pat has been my best friend since we first met in primary school.
That is now twenty years ago.
I really like Pat, she's funny, has a good sense of humour and like me she loves to discuss everything.
So therefore, my decision to ask her about my decision was the best thing I could do.
She really listened to me and told me that I was doing the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application to a language course in England.
I wanted to keep this a secret until I received the answer from the School.
But it is OK, I still like Pat, even though she can't keep a secret.
My name is Lisa and I'm 21 years old.
I went to the theatre last Friday to see Over the Rainbow and I felt disappointed about the musical.
I expected more from it.
First of all the actor was the same as last semester.
I would really like to see a new one such as Markin Davis, he is a great actor and he would fit well in this musical.
Then I was sat with my friend just waiting for the start and that lasted forever and it was supposed to start at 19:30.
After the show I felt really hungry, so I intended to go to the restaurant, which was closed.
By this time I thought: "I want my money back." What was supposed to be a perfect evening turned out to be the most hateful musical I've ever seen.
Once, when we first met, I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time we had finished we found out that we had formed a very good friendship through our conversation.
One day she came over to my house and we talked all night about our lives.
Then I told her about my first kiss (it was terrible, the guy didn't know how to do it) and things like that.
The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience of kissing.
People were staring at me and laughing.
I got really mad at her, but nowadays we are friends, not as close as we used to be.
I don't tell her my secrets anymore.
I'm writing to you to complain about the musical that I saw when I went to the theatre during my holidays in London.
First of all, I had read in the advertisement that it would start at 19:30 and that I could get a discount, but it started at 20:15, which meant that I had to wait for forty-five minutes, and there wasn't any discount on tickets.
To my surprise Danny Brook never appeared.
There was a different actor instead and it made me very annoyed.
He is my favourite actor and I paid to see him not to see a different actor.
Finally at the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it hadn't been repaired .
I think you should have told people about this in the advertisement.
I was a bit disappointed because you said that it would be a perfect evening and it wasn't.
Asking people about the Fashion of the Future you realise that there are different opinions.
Adults think that the new coloured clothes that young people wear are horrible and very untraditional.
Most of them believe that they are kind of crazy or evil.
They think that in the future they will change and start to wear more formal clothes.
Most young people like Carol believe the same and use their minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
After all, they'll be the ones that decide what the Fashion of the Future will be like.
I have recently been to London for a week's holiday.
As I am a fan of musicals I went to see this show.
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisement were not really true.
It was written that the stars would be Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
Danny Brook is one of my favourite actors and there appeared a different one.
I felt very disappointed.
It was also written that there were discounts available and I asked about them and they said that they weren't allowed to give any discount.
After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks.
As you say in your advertisement, it was not my perfect evening out and therefore I would like to have my money back.
Modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot.
On the one hand, nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return on the same day you can take a plane without any problem.
In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day.
Another advantage is that if you go on an excursion and you take your mobile phone, if you get lost somebody can find you.
On the other hand, the main disadvantage is that using modern machines can be very difficult for elderly people; it would be very if the modern industries trained people to use modern technologies.
To sum up, modern technology has changed our daily lives a lot and this is going to continue.
Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisement regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above-mentioned show.
We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters.
Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected.
According to your advertisement the play should have started at 19:30.
Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes.
The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15.
What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apology.
We had been told that discounts on the ticket prices were available but on the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered.
After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant, which was - to our surprise - closed because of the delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment.
Honestly for us it was not that "perfect evening out".
We would like to ask you if there is any chance of getting our money back or if you can offer any other alternative ? We are looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully M.
S.
I'm writing to you regarding the radio programme next Saturday where "The old man and the Sea" by Earnest Hemingway will be read.
I recommend you listen to it! As you know we have already had several discussions about literature and what it can tell or teach us.
I suppose you still wonder what the great authors can do for us? Therefore Hemingway is a very good example.
He fought in the Spanish Civil war and in World War II was always in search of answers to questions like "...
what defines a man", or "...
what happens to us in critical situations".
These experiences influenced him so deeply that he described his feelings in several books.
One of the most interesting ones is "The old man and the Sea".
A story of an old seaman leaving his town to prove that he is still able to catch the biggest fish ever caught.
The story describes his feelings, thoughts, fears and emotions during a struggle with a giant deep-sea fish.
In the end he wins but before he is able to get back he has to "sacrifice" his fish to attacking sharks.
So did he finally win or loose? An interesting story - demanding in a way - which can give you an impression of Hemingway's work and what he meant by "pace under pressure".
I am writing to complain about your musical show "Over the Rainbow".
Last week I was on holiday in London and I was very disappointed when I visited your theatre.
First of all, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed until 20.15, and when the show finally began we were surprised to see that Danny Brook, who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing.
Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available on the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there weren't any.
Last but not least, the advertisement says to visit your restaurant after the show, but when we went to the restaurant we discovered that it was closed because the cook was ill.
The advertisement says that it is going to be your perfect evening out, but it was not.
It was a complete waste of time and money.
That is why I would like to request a full refund of my money.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, but she was her best friend and she had to trust her.
Anna told her again: "Pat don't tell  anyone please, especially my brother, everything would be ruined then".
And Pat answered: "Don't worry I won't tell anyone".
The big secret was that Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother John and she didn't want anyone to know about it.
She had told  Pat though and that was extremely dangerous! Anna couldn't do anything though because she needed her help to give out the invitations.
The party was set to be in two days.
- "What?" Anna couldn't believe it, she was devastated, she started crying and told Pat "Get out of my house, now!!!" Pat left.
Everything was ruined, the party and their friendship.
During a prior holiday in London I came across an encouraging advertisement for the show and decided to see it.
Unfortunately, I was very disappointed to find out that there were no discounts available! Therefore, it cost me more money then usual.
In addition, I was very annoyed by the fact that the event had started at 20:15 - not 19:30 as stated in the advertisement.
Having noticed that this was not 'a perfect evening out' I would like to ask for my money back.
I feel that I have been lied to and thus I demand my money be returned.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
Everyone had soon heard about me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation.
This was the kind of association everybody knew about but nobody talked about.
Everyone was aware that talking aloud about the 'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble.
There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards.
I've always enjoyed danger and this time getting the password was, indeed, .
But knowing what these people are capable of makes me wonder whether to use it or not.
Especially now, when 'big-mouth' Pat has spread the news to literally everyone.
I wouldn't be surprised if suddenly something bad happened to me.
I am writing to you because I had a very disappointing evening at the Circle Theatre.
Well it seems to me that you should know what happened there.
First of all, I read your advertisement where it was written that the show started at 19.30, but do you know what time it started? It started at 20:15! Don't you think that shows a lack of respect? Really it does.
I forgot to tell you that there were no discounts available.
And the tickets were too expensive! Most people couldn't afford them.
And another thing, when the show was over, I was really hungry.
But as I had read your advertisement I knew there was a restaurant.
So I went there in order to have something to eat.
But can you believed it? It was closed.
Completely closed.
So I asked someone who seemed to be in charge, and he told me that it was too late to have a meal.
This really disappointed me.
I was both hungry and angry.
Well I think that is all, but I will ask you to give me my money back.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Well first of all, Pat was a very good friend of mine.
He was really a good friend, until something happened.
I was attending college, as I normally do.
With nothing to lose, at all, but on the contrary, with a lot to learn .
I was very keen on English lessons, maybe because I was sitting near the Boy I loved.
Yes, I think this was the only reason.
His name was Cody.
He was a very handsome and good-looking boy.
But more than that, he was a very kind person.
Pat told me that he was also in love with me.
He told me that it was necessary to do something about it.
But I didn't know what to do.
Pat suggested I talk to him.
But I really didn't manage to do so.
As Pat was losing his patience, he decided to talk to him.
I can say that I was very nervous and anxious about what was going to happen.
He didn't keep my secret.
Pat told him that I was in love with him.
This was my secret and now it was not.
But even so, I think it was for the best, he was also in love with me.
But on the other hand I will never trust Pat.
I am writing to complain about the problems  at your musical show.
First of all you said that the star would be Danny Brook but it was not.
Another actor took his place.
Also, the time that the show should have started was 19:30 but it started forty-five minutes later.
People started to complain.
What about the discounts? They did not exist.
Apart from this, there is more.
After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the chef of the restaurant was ill.
This is not an excuse.
You have to excuse me, but this was a very disappointing evening.
I would like you to give me my money back.
I am very disappointed with you.
I did not expect these problems from you.
I am waiting your answer as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
One day Brian, Pat's best friend, told him a secret.
It was an important secret for Brian.
He told him that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class.
Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian.
Pat told this secret to Beth, Jane's best friend.
He didn't tell her the secret because he wanted to hurt Brian but because he wanted to help him.
Brian was very embarrassed to ask Jane out on a date.
So, Beth asked Jane if she was in love with Brian and she said that she was.
When Pat heard the good news he told Brian to ask her out on a date and he knew that she would accept.
Brian found out what had happened and at first he was angry with Pat but then he thanked him.
Jane and Brian were very happy.
I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does.
This was another disappointing thing about that evening.
But my complaint does not finish here.
It was my understanding that discounts were available on the tickets, as the advertisement showed, but there were no discounts.
And what is more, I could not go to the restaurant after the show, as it was closed because the main chef was ill and could not come to work.
Definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances I really believe you should give me my money back.
The thing was that Mary couldn't resist the secrecy and phoned her cousin, who also studied in our school.
She was the director of the school newspaper and Mary didn't tell her it was a secret, so on Monday at 9 a.m.
MY SECRET was published in the school paper and at the end of the day, eventually everybody had read the "news".
I didn't know it was published as I didn't read the paper and no one told me anything, either.
But I soon knew it because when I went to the school canteen everybody was staring at me and whispering to each other.
At first I didn't realise what was happening, but then a friend of mine told me that everyone knew that I was going out with the most popular boy in the school and that we had kissed each other in the park last Friday.
Suddenly my face went all red and I ran towards the toilet.
I had never felt so embarrassed and miserable in my life, but luckily next day almost everybody forgot about it.
My name is Joseph and I am writing this letter to complain about the mess that the administration of the Circle theatre presented to me.
Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre.
We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's favourite actor, but we were quite disappointed.
My son was very happy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time.
However, that's just the beginning of the problems we had.
Expecting British punctuality, we went to the theatre at 19:00 to watch the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15.
It finished later than it was supposed to and then we missed the train.
I didn't see any discounts available; I thought my son would have paid less than I.
As we had already missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
Because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work hard so that this theatre, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganised shows.
People have seen in the last 10 years how different our clothes can become .
Clothes used to be made of cotton, but nowadays we can see shirts, pants, socks....made of almost anything.
It is a revolution in fashion that is starting now.
Nowadays we have a kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our bodies , and clothes that don't get wet or even dirty.
Computers are little things nowadays, but at the speed at which technology develops, in the next century clothes will tell our doctors about our health at any moment, any time, anywhere, people will be able to locate us around the world.
In the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even colour.
Our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the weather, our , all our needs.
It has already started and has no limits .
I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show at your theatre with a friend.
We had seen your advertisement for the show, which made it seem very attractive.
Unfortunately, the musical show wasn't much like that the one the advert had described, and that is why I want to ask you for some money back.
The star had been changed, the show had started at 20:15, and there were no discounts available.
Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for renovation.
And your last phrase in the advertisement was "Your perfect evening out"! It wasn't that at all, as I have explained to you above in this letter.
I thank you in advance and hope for a positive resonse.
When I began working in an Insurance Company, I had only an old typewriter, which made a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with because the buttons were hard on my small fingers.
Now I have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also faster.
But when the computer doesn't work, I have a big problem doing my work.
Also now it is better to use the Internet to write a letter to a friend overseas.
It is so practical, in five minutes my friend can read my letter.
And he can answer me very quickly.
I think it is now the future of big companies to work with the Internet.
I am writing to inform you of some problems we had.
I went to the theatre to see "Over The Rainbow" on 17th June.
First of all, we went to the ticket office to get the tickets.
I thought we could buy discounts tickets because of the advertisement.
However, we couldn't .
Eventually, we got the tickets, because we wanted to see the musical and Danny Brook.
When we arrived at the theatre, we were very disappointed, because a different actor performed in the musical that day.
In addition, it started at 20:15.
We had to wait over 40 minutes and we couldn't enjoy dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show.
I think if the musical starts late , you should the restaurant late .
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
It was ship!! There was a beach by our town.
One day, Freddie found it there.
It was old and a little dilapidated.
But it was the most important place in the world.
We always played there and it was an adventure for us.
One day, suddenly, a heavy storm came to our town.
I went to the beach to check on our ship.
My friends had gone there, too.
We worried about it and we tried to it.
It seemed to sink into the sea, but fortunately, the storm soon went away.
Our ship was left on the beach.
And our parents and teachers were there, too, because Pat had called them.
Of course we couldn't play there after that.
I have recently been on a holiday to London.
During my stay I went to see the musical "Over the Rainbow".
Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed.
Secondly I would also like to say that the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it did not start until 20.15.
Finally when it started we noticed to our surprise that it was not the right actor on stage.
Very disappointing, as Danny Brook is my favourite actor.
We watched the musical in sadness.
Afterwards we wanted to go for a pleasant dinner.
To our surprise the restaurant was closed because of a lack of staff to keep it open.
It was certainly not a perfect night out.
I would be very pleased if I could have my money back.
I hope to receive payment as soon as possible.
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy about that.
I gave it some thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind off plastic fabrics.
My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes.
I mean when the Earth's getting warmer and warmer because of the pollution that we people create in the world.
Maybe in the future they'll find a new fabric which protects you from dirt and dangerous sunshine.
Maybe everybody will end up wearing shorts and skirts.
Formal suits will be transformed into school-uniform-like shirts and knee-length shorts.
Last weekend, I was in London with my friend and I saw your musical show "over the Rainbow".
I write this letter to you to describe the very bad evening I have had in your theatre.
In the paper it was written that the principal actor is "Danny Brook" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor whom we had never seen, or heard.
I think it's really not right.
But I am not finished, you wrote in the paper "Discounts available" but it wasn't true; it was very badly organised.
After this bad show we had wanted to go to the Restaurant for a drink and to eat something and it was closed and nobody explained to us why the Restaurant wasn't open.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this sentence is very popular in our school.
Pat is not an girl.
She is very friendly but she can't keep a secret.
Last year, on a Saturday evening, my boyfriend phoned me at 20 h and said to me, "Would you like to go to the cinema with me." I asked my parents but they said to me, "No, you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school." Then I phoned Pat to explain my big problem.
Pat said to me, "You say to your parents that you will sleep with me and you aren't going to the cinema." I asked my parents and they said, "Alright you can go to Pat's to sleep." I was very happy, I phoned my boyfriend and I told him my secret.
He said, "Alright, so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema".
I spent a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phoned Pat's mother and Pat's mother explained the whole story to my mother.
If Pat hadn't told her mother the secret I would not have had a problem.
Since that Saturday evening I have never spoken to Pat.
I'm writing to complain about the service me last Saturday evening at The Circle Theatre.
When the play began I realised that the main actor had been replaced and the new one wasn't good at all.
This is not a simple question because I have been used to dealing with technology since I was a child but I'm going to try to explain to you how .
I didn't have a computer until I was eight.
Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability.
At that time I used the computer only to play video games.
When I was thirteen I discovered a completely different use for my computer.
It became essential to doing my homework.
And years later it enabled me to get a very good job.
One day my mother got a terrible disease.
She had to be operated on and my family and I were very scared.
But when we talked to the doctor we felt more relaxed because he told us that the operation was a very simple one.
I think that if my mother had got ill ten years before, she wouldn't have survived.
Modern technology is better now than it used to be.
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show Over the rainbow.
My wife and I went to The Circle Theatre last Saturday evening because we love the main actor, Danny Brook.
We felt very disappointed when we discovered that Danny had been replaced by an unknown and really bad actor.
That is why I am writing to you.
I want you to give us our money back because the things published in your advertisement aren't true.
There should be no problem as I still have the tickets.
I'm always very busy travelling from one country to another, you know.
I'm writing to you now because I've been told that a short story by Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio.
It will be next Sunday on the local station at five o'clock in the evening.
It's a story entitled Accident, and I think you'll enjoy it.
The story is about life in a small village.
The main character is a retired police inspector who recognises a woman.
Drop me a line and let me know what you make of the story.
We are writing to you to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow", which we saw last week in your Theatre.
We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by another one at the last minute.
The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it actually started at 20:15 due to a problem with the sound.
We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts weren't available for us, because they didn't accept our student identity cards from Switzerland.
We were very frustrated to read on the door of the theatre restaurant "Closed due to holidays", specially when we were really starving.
This evening was a waste of time.
So we ask you for our money back.
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Could you figure out how your life would be without modern technology? What is the effect it has on your environment? Were people happier in the past than today? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested in this article.
Nowadays, technology takes up a large part of your daily life and improves the speed of .
For example at work, we look at the computer screen all day, sending e-mail to the other side of the world, doing some research etc.
We gain a lot of time with the computer, but if your computer broke down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it.
Technology moves very fast, specially in the area of transportation.
Cars are able to reach speeds of 300 km per hour and are more reliable than in the past.
The major problem for the industrial cities is to deal with the bad effects of pollution on the environment.
A lot of money is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of pollution.
Owing to the bad organisation of the last play that was performed in your theatre in recent weeks, I want to tell you about some incorrect information that I found in your advertisement, as a result of which all the problems that I had occurred.
First of all, I think if you go to a play and you are watching to see your favourite actor playing a good role and then there appears a silly one, who doesn't know what to do, it is disappointing .
Secondly, the whole audience were waiting for the beginning of the play at 19.30 and it started at 20.15, so I would like to know why you say one time in the advertisement and why you do what you want.
Another thing that I want to know is why you didn't give any discount though one was advertised in the advertisement.
Maybe, it is a good way to get an audience but I'm going to tell my travel agent.
When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because, as was written on the paper that was on the door, it was too late.
I don't think it was my perfect evening out so I wait to be refunded.
It all started when she was fifteen, when she started a new course in the institute and met some girls that in time would become her friends.
When it was time to take the final exam, she became ill and she couldn't do it so the teachers decided to allow her to pass the course because she had a lot of good marks, but the principal disagreed and didn't give permission to pass her.
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and as is usual the girls from the last course became popular.
Pat, to win her new classmates' friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what Pat said, her friends ended their friendship with Pat because their popularity was damaged.
Pat's classmates did the same and Pat ended up alone.
I saw the musical show during my holiday.
I was disappointed with it.
I must ask you for my money back.
First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing Danny Brook but, actually, it did not star Danny Brook but another person.
Besides, her acting didn't .
Also, there was no .
Finally, I went to the restaurant in your theatre but it was closed.
I couldn't eat anything.
That's the nub of my complaints.
Thus I had a terrible time - it was a waste of time.
I'm expecting your reply soon.
I think after 100 years, at least something will change as regards design, material, colour, etc.
 an example, the Kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) will be worn not only in Japan but also in other countries in general.
Also .
.
Through one country's traditional clothing  of another country, .
On the other hand, the personality (character) of each country might vanish.
However, .
Also, .
Recently I had a week's holiday in London.
During my stay I went to The Circle Theatre to see "Over the rainbow", "London's newest and best musical show." I have to admit that this was my great mistake.
Never before had I had such a disappointing evening.
To make matters worse, the show started at 20.15, although the advertisement said it would begin at 19.30.
And on top of everything your theatre restaurant was closed because of the waiters' strike, so I had to look for another place to have a snack.
You can imagine how upset I am at having suffered such discomfort and disappointment.
It wasn't a "perfect evening out" at all! That is why I expect at least half the ticket price back.
I hope you will give this matter your immediate consideration.
Otherwise I'll have to apply to the courts for aid.
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer.
On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in the future.
We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic cloth in 2100.
Of course, these new materials won't be so harmful to our health as today's nylon and other things like that.
On the other hand, people tend to wear natural clothes today, made of cotton, wool etc.
This tendency may result in rejecting synthetics completely.
And it is even more difficult to predict what clothes in the future will look like.
People's imaginations are enormous.
I am writing to complain about the musical which was performed at The Circle Theatre last week.
I saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisement I read in the local newspaper.
First of all, the main actor was not Dany Brook as was expected .
That was very disappointing.
Secondly it was meant to have started at 14.30 and ended by 19.30.
However, it started at 20.15.
I had to wait almost an hour.
Then, I was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so I could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
Finally, I was thinking of having dinner in the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed due to some problems with the employees.
What was supposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time.
So I would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the money I spent on the tickets.
Computers, radio, CDs, satellite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life.
Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects of my life, and it has some advantages as well as some disadvantages.
On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school.
What I mean is that computers are very useful for doing my homework (like some or research).
And I can't even think what it would be like not having a computer.
Another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole world.
On the other hand, I have to admit that technology makes things so easy that when I have to do them without it I find it very difficult.
The best example is the homework I have to do for school.
I can't manage to do it when I don't have my computer to help.
In addition to that, technology sometimes doesn't let me develop my imagination and creative skills.
My mother says that I'm always playing with my computer or watching T.V.
instead of reading or doing some more interesting activities.
To sum up, I can't think what my life would be like without technology.
First, the advertisement said that there were discounts available, but when I went to buy the tickets there were not any discounts.
On top of everything, the restaurant which was advertised in the advertisement was closed because it was being .
You can imagine how disappointed I felt after that evening, and I am writing to ask you for a refund of part of the money.
I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot with these things.
In music, before I had a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them in my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I can just record one part, and then another part, and then another one..
and I can get the sound of every instrument, controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds.
In graphic design, before I had a computer I could just draw, but now I can create pictures pixel by pixel, develop ideas more easily, or put photographs into my computer and transform them or mix them.
But, in other things, I think modern technology hasn't changed my way of life too much: I do more or less the same as I did some years ago: I get up in the morning, go to school, have lunch, study and go out with my friends without being affected by microchips or nuclear energy.
I'm writing to you to complain about the problems which at the "Over the Rainbow" musical show.
In the advertisement I read that Danny Brook starred in the show but when I got there I realised there was a different actor in his place whose acting wasn't good enough.
I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't.
It started at 20:15 leaving us waiting for forty five minutes.
You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it.
In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening at the show very unpleasant.
As you are the manager of the show, you should try to avoid these sorts of problems in future shows.
I also ask you to return some of my money for the unpleasant evening I spent at your show.
In the future people will wear clothes made of polyester and nylon because cotton and wool will be rare and expensive.
Also I think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with pollution - I think there will be many such places in a hundred years - and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will do damage to the human skin.
Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm on cold winters' days.
As you can realise, I think the future's clothes will be adjusted not only according to fashion and the seasons but to the needs of every .
Last week my family and I had a holiday in London.
At the end of the holiday we decided to go to the theatre.
I insisted on going to your theatre, to the Circle Theatre, because I have heard that it is one of the best theatres in London.
That day you were showing ,,The over the Rainbow".
As you have written in the advertisement: it is London's newest and best musical show.
But my family and I had a very disappointing evening.
This was because, firstly, in it said in the advertisement that this music show would star Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it wasn't so.
Danny Brook didn't act in the performance, there was another, unknown, actor.
And he acted awfully, I couldn't hear him.
Then in the advertisement it said that the performance began at 19.30.
My family and I came at that time and had to wait till 20:15, because the show started only at that time.
I was very .
What is more, you wrote that discounts were available, but that was also a lie.
After the show I was very disappointed, because I spent a lot of money for nothing and my husband decided to .
He suggested having supper in your theatre restaurant.
But when we got to it, we saw that the restaurant was closed, because it was being reconstructed.
But why do you mention about the restaurant in the advertisement, if it is closed? So this evening was terrible.
It spoilt all my impression of London.
And now I request my money back, because I didn't get anything that was mentioned in the advertisement.
There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appeared not long ago.
Among them, the mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house.
All of them play a very great role in people's daily life.
The first change is that they greatly simplify the life of people.
For example, now women don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing dishes.
They can just turn on their dishwashers and go to do something that they think more pleasant.
So with the appearance of new modern technology people have got much more free time.
The computer also plays a very important role in the daily life of people.
Some years ago people, especially students, had to run to libraries in order to find a book about something.
But now they can use the Internet, where you can find any information you need.
I use the Internet very often, and I must say it is very convenient.
Another piece of modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone.
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, or if something terrible has happened to me, I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box.
I just use my mobile phone.
Finally, I can say that modern technology really helps people in their work.
With it people do their work more quickly and successfully.
During a week's holiday I had in London, I went to see your last musical show called "Over the rainbow" at The Circle Theatre.
I saw an advertisement which made it seem very attractive to me.
Firstly, I decided to go see your show to be entertained by the performance of Danny Brook so I was very sad to find another actor on the stage.
Another thing was the time.
In fact, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30.
It's unbelievable it was 45 minutes late.
When I got to the ticket office before the show to buy my ticket I asked for a senior discount, and the woman told me there were no discounts available such as I had read on the advertisement.
I think you will understand why it was not "my perfect evening out" as you said, but one of the worst.
For all these reasons I am asking you to give me my money back.
During my last holiday in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement for the "Over the rainbow" show.
I wanted to spend my free time well by taking in that cultural event.
How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed.
First of all, in the advertisement it was written, as I had read before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show.
Unfortunately, a different actor stood in for him.
was written as half past two p.m.
and half past seven that evening, again.
Lack of time made me go to the evening show.
And unfortunately again, for some reason, it was delayed until quarter past eight.
Another problem - in the advertisement it was definitely written that there were some discounts on the tickets.
No, alas, in reality it appeared to be a mistake.
According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink.
That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed.
The reason was unknown.
That wasn't enough still.
At the end of the advertisement I noticed it said something about a perfect evening out.
It wasn't true.
That's why I am writing my letter to you and I am asking for my money back.
I was expecting something much better.
Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet in court.
I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affect every aspect of my daily life.
Looking back to the past, I can see how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine.
People living in the past couldn't travel so much as we can now and couldn't the news around the world as we do now, in the present day.
They could not communicate with someone living in another country, located far away from their own.
Using mobile phones, e-mails or the Internet, we have better access to a lot of different information.
So, we are in a better situation now.
But there are some drawbacks, which appeared in recent years.
For example, a lot of pollution has been created.
We now breathe worse air in our lungs than our grandparents breathed.
I think we are more addicted to doing some things which are not concerned with human nature.
For example, people are addicted today to watching TV or often using mobile phones.
I don't really mind them.
But I think and strongly believe that we are a part of nature.
And the modern technology that we use in our everyday life might not only help us, but might destroy us.
I am writing to you because of the unpleasant evening I have had recently.
I had always thought that the plays of the Circle Theatre are worth seeing, but two days ago I was very disappointed after visiting your theatre.
Earlier I had seen an advertisement for the show but the information on it was false.
First of all, I did not see my favourite actor, Danny Brook.
The second thing is that the play did not start at 19:30 but at 20:15! I could not get a discount.
The last thing is that it was impossible to go to the theatre restaurant because it was closed.
I was told that it had been painted but nobody had written that on the advertisement.
Finally, I would like to say that my evening out two days ago was not perfect and I would be glad if you could give some of my money back.
Modern technology is changing the world every day.
I would like to write about how it has influenced my daily life.
The last example is that I have a lot of modern equipment in my house, like a TV set, fridge and microwave which help me in my life.
I am writing to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening at a musical show at your theatre.
There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out.
Firstly, the advertisement said that Danny Brook was going to star in the musical but it turned out to be a completely different person, which was very disappointing.
It was very unprofessional of you to have the wrong in the paper.
Secondly, according to the advertisement, the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15, which caused me problems.
As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said I would in the advertisement.
However, none was available, which was very disappointing again.
Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant, which was recommended in the advertisement.
However, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the staff vacation, which I thought was very unprofessional.
With all the dissatisfaction above, therefore, I would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been.
I hope that you will consider this letter carefully and try to improve your .
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
How did we know that she was that kind of person? Well, it all began when Pat's friend, Molly, went down to London...
Molly went down to London for the shopping and as she was walking along the street, she saw some familiar faces on the other side of the street.
It was Vance and Sally, whom she had not seen for ages.
Pat, too, is a friend of theirs and has seen them from time to time.
Molly, Vance and Sally had a quick chat and said good-bye to each other as, to Molly, they seemed to be in a hurry and as Molly knew that they had been dating, she wanted them to enjoy their time together.
I am writing to inform you about the bad experience I had yesterday evening going to the theatre.
According to the advertisement, one of the actors who would perform was Danny Brook but for some unknown reasons, there was another, disappointing actor instead of him.
By the way, the musical show started at 20:15, when it was meant to start at 19:30: it wasn't just late, it was much too late.
We waited an hour to not see what we were waiting for.
And what's more, there weren't any discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter were the actors and the staff.
Well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons I demand to have my money back, I wasted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programme I paid for.
Science and technology have changed man's life: that's true, I don't need to look at how they affect the lives of others, I only have to see how they have changed my life.
Radio, television, stereo, CD, computer: it's hard to believe, but every day I'm using something that was born from technology.
Science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something that interests you.
But they can also have a bad influence on people's minds.
Since I went to school, I've seen my way of thinking change: in my mind everything must be in order like in the CD-rom of a computer.
It's incredible but if I think of the key-word of the mind, the only one I can think of is ORDER.
Then there are television, radio, stereo: another bad aspect is that every day, consciously, I'm using these instruments.
They are objects which make up part of my life.
In the afternoon I spend two hours listening to the radio or watching television instead of going to the city centre: it seems I prefer staying with objects without an aim and that can't speak with me, rather than meeting new people, speaking with them and being in contact with the "human world".
Am I crazy? No, I'm only a daughter of technology.
Yesterday my grandmother asked me what I would do without the computer.
I answered her saying I probably would die.
Last week I went to the Circle theatre, for which you are responsible, to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow".
The advertisement outside the theatre described a lot of interesting things to enjoy.
I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening.
Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way.
Firstly there was a different actor in the starring role; you had written DANNY BROOK and he was absent.
I had attended the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you had changed the programme.
Moreover the advertisement said that the time of the show was 19.30; on the contrary it started 45 minutes late.
Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the full price.
But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant in the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner.
So it was not "my perfect evening out" and because of my disappointment I am writing to ask you for some money back.
I think modern technology has changed mankind's life a lot, especially since last century.
The changes brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or without a part of it.
In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity : I live on a little mountain at 160 metres altitude so I cannot go to the city using a bicycle.
Because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the Internet to study or do research, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
Moreover my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city without a cellular phone because it is too far and she gets worried.
Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like to play guitar very much, and in my free time I prefer to play electric, than acoustic or classical guitar, using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.
I am writing to complain about your musical show.
I am not really satisfied with it.
Lots of information in your advertisement is not correct.
Some problems of organisation seem to have appeared.
Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing evening at your show but that didn't happen.
In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.
They were replaced by less famous actors.
Unfortunately, the musical was boring.
I was terribly disappointed.
Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written .
I had to wait for 45 minutes doing nothing.
I wish you had informed us beforehand.
Secondly, I had to pay full price whereas you guaranteed us some discount prices.
I was very interested in visiting your theatre restaurant after the show but it seemed to me it was closed.
Your assistant prevented us from visiting it because it was too late and he was so busy.
Finally, you thought that you could give us a perfect evening but that was not true.
Consequently, I would like you to refund my ticket.
Nowadays, we need modern technology to improve daily life.
In my opinion, science and technology will have consequences on my behaviour.
First of all, as you know, lots of technology has advanced in a few years.
For example, without using the Internet I could not get through to foreign people.
This interactive method of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions.
I feel free as an eagle.
I can take advantage of such technologies as mobile phones, lap top computers, televisions, to have contact with different cultures.
Secondly, technology has changed my daily life because it allows me to do many more things than before.
Unfortunately, it could be an inconvenience for me because of pollution from cars and factories.
I can't go to the town centre of a big city.
There are links between the greenhouse effect, technology and me.
To conclude, we must not forget that science and technology is a tool to help us to live better.
Be careful, my own technology can kill me.
I can use it but only within limits.
I am writing to you in order to describe my last visit to your theatre.
Unfortunately, I am very disappointed about the organisation of your company.
Firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m.
but 45 minutes later.
I paid for this performance the full price of £20 because discounts were not available although in your advertisement they were.
And the biggest disappointment for me was that the great Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and another unknown person was singing.
And last but not least, I found out after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come...
I don't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed.
I am looking forward to your answer.
In my opinion, modern technology has changed our daily life tremendously.
First of all it changed our lifestyle.
For example, ten years ago almost all people visited cinemas and today they prefer watching films at home because they have relatively good video-recorders and TVs.
Because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively - they can often visit their friends and travel much more.
People today are more for the world.
Secondly, we can do our jobs today more efficiently.
We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail.
We can communicate with our clients faster and better and offer them better services.
Ordered goods can be delivered in a shorter time by trains, trucks and modern ships.
If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more in our daily life - on better clothes, furniture, .
I am a fan of modern technology.
During my holiday in London I decided to go to the theatre.
I found your advertisement in the tourist board offices and as the musical "Over the rainbow" seemed to be a good option I chose it.
The problem is that there were some differences between the advertisement and the show I saw.
First, Danny Brook wasn't the star that night, he was replaced by an actor that seemed like a rookie.
Another problem, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 and when it finished I couldn't have dinner because the theatre's restaurant was closed (it closes at 22:00).
Moreover, there weren't any discounts available (I'm a student but I paid for a full-price ticket).
 and I want to be given a refund.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend, who is called Eingrid.
She was a really nice person and loved me a lot.
understand why I'm writing about the past.
The Circle Theatre was once the best theatre in my opinion, but now, I must change my opinion.
I visited your Theatre yesterday.
I would have liked to see the best musical show with the best artists.
Unfortunately, instead of Danny Brook we have seen an unknown actor.
We were disappointed.
Moreover, this show did not start at 19.30, but 45 minutes later.
Another problem - the tickets for students according to your advertisement should .
Unfortunately I could not buy such a ticket.
During the interval I would have liked to drink coffee in the theatre restaurant - it was closed.
I don't know why.
I would not have thought that so serious a theatre would make such mistakes.
, I would like to ask you to return me my money.
"Fashion of the Future" - it is a good question.
Fashion is changing every year.
During the next fashion shows we see new clothes.
In my opinion, in the future people will wear clothes made of natural fabrics; silk, cotton, leather, wool.
All synthetic material will be uncomfortable for these people.
Women will prefer long skirts and short blouses and jackets.
Of course, the clothes will be smart.
Young people will wear jeans and T-shirts.
Such clothes are comfortable and easy to wear.
Teenagers have no free time to go to the launderette.
Men will wear as usual - a suit.
Fashionable colours - they will be earth colours: grey, blue, yellow, brown.
For special occasions, for example a party, a concert, people will dress very smartly.
I think that it will be dresses, and suits sewed by the well-known tailors.
 All materials should be thin, delicate and soft, because of the warm climate.
I think that we will observe a few slow changes in fashion, but I hope that new clothes will always be pleasant for people.
To begin with, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but, due to a "technical problem", as they said, it started at 20:15.
However, it would not have been such a great problem if the show  had proved to be as good as they promised but it really was not worth seeing, especially because the main actor was not Danny Brook, whom we expected, but an unknown, clearly an inexperienced young actor, named Tom Douglas.
What is more, there were no discounts available on the ticket prices nor had we the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons.
I am not satisfied with the service we received, I am therefore writing to request a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque by post for £20.
In the 21st century, people will all the wearing the same clothes, the same shoes, they will be buying the same accessories.
We'll get up in the morning and find that our neighbour wears the same jacket and he's boasting about a pair of shoes which are too similar to ours.
I am writing with reference to your theatre.
I would like to apologise to you for my controversial opinion but I feel really disappointed.
Firstly, I would like to explain to you what the problem is.
I came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a taste of English culture.
I'd seen your advertisement which recommended the play 'Over the rainbow' and I liked it very much.
I decided to go to the Circle Theatre with the hope that your show would provide me with all these emotions that I had been looking for in Great Britain.
Please forgive me but you didn't do your best.
I heard about Danny Brook in Poland and I wanted to see him on the stage but it wasn't possible.
There was a change to the lead which annoyed me a lot.
Furthermore, the show was to begin at about 19.30 but it didn't.
You were 45 minutes late.
Waiting was horrible.
In the advertisement 'DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE' was written.
Shall I ask you one question? - Why weren't they available? Everybody was shocked and I was trying to keep the faith.
I didn't expect more surprises at your Theatre.
Nevertheless, after the show I was very hungry so I went to the theatre restaurant and what did I see? A poster: "Closed because of the illness of the chef." There were some more disappointing situations about which I don't want to write.
Finally - you offered a wonderful evening but I must say that if I had known that it was going to be like that I wouldn't have wasted my time.
I feel entitled to write this letter and I feel the .
I would like to get back my money.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes.
Many things have been replaced by others which are more helpful and useful.
The most important thing for me is using a computer.
The main advantage is that it provides you with all the information that you need.
For example, you have to write an Essay about the 2nd world war.
You get on to the Internet and you're looking for those facts and information which will help you to do your homework.
Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast.
Furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately this fact especially has changed my life.
Playing the games takes up a lot of time and it has become a bad habit.
I have no time for learning and for domestic chores.
On the other hand, playing games and using a computer widens my brain so, as you can see, this modern stuff has got many advantages and disadvantages.
The next thing that has changed my life is a mobile telephone.
This little thing brings a lot of satisfaction.
It is very useful too.
I have got a steady with my parents and friends.
I have no problems with changing the time of a meeting because I can always phone.
But actually it is boring when you're almost always under observation.
The modern technologies have brought to my life a lot of changes.
It is even seen in domestic chores.
For example, I've got at home a very modern and special machine which irons by itself.
My mother is happy and I am happier because I don't need to make an effort to iron the clothes.
I only press the button and everything is done fine.
I admire the people who made those machines and I would like to give them a tribute.
They made my life better.
Although your advertisement stated that the main actor would be Danny Brook, it was not him and a different man appeared, who was not prepared for the role.
Secondly, your advertisement stated that the second show should start at 19:30.
This was not true because the audience had to wait until 20:15.
Then, I did not get a discount and I had to buy a full-price ticket, although I am not an adult yet.
Finally, I was hungry after waiting for the show and wanted to order something to eat.
This was, however, impossible because the theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons.
I would like you then to send the money back to me because I did not enjoy the show at all and the ticket cost a fortune.
I am writing to complain about my visit to the Circle Theatre during my last holiday in London.
I saw a musical show and it was not .
I was confused because there was a different actor in place of Danny Brook.
Secondly, the show started at 20.15.
This is why I was to your restaurant after the show.
Unfortunately, I found closed doors and no information about the reason.
I would like to add that, being a student, I find discounts very important for my budget.
Also, without any reason being given they were not available.
I will be glad if you will send my money back.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
This was the reason why we were in horrible trouble with the police.
What is more, our friends didn't want to talk to us.
Let's go back to the beginning of this story.
I and my friends had a holiday and decided to spend a few days on an "island".
We called this place this, because it was a piece of land in the middle of our lake.
We tried to survive there without returning to land - to our town.
There was no light at night so we had to find some wood to make a fire.
I was walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered some gold.
This is no joke! There was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
We found the solution to this desperate situation - to say nothing to anybody.
So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but...
I think you are able to imagine what happened later.
I have recently been to London and I saw the show "Over the Rainbow" at The Circle Theatre.
I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me.
It should have started at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed.
But the worst thing about "London's newest and best musical show", as you called it, was the absence of Danny Brook.
The actor who was "dancing" was horrible.
He was making mistakes all the time.
In the advertisement, it was written "your perfect evening out".
Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money.
I hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I told him my worst love story.
One day, I was going to school by bus and - I don't know why - I went to the end of it.
I looked up and I saw her, standing next to me with her friend.
Every time I looked up at her my legs were shaking so I couldn't get up and talk to her! But with help from my friend, who convinced me to do this, I met her.
Her name was Sue and she was so beautiful that I still can't find words which could be good to describe her.
I was constantly seeing her but my shyness made my mouth close so I couldn't say anything! I was in Love but that wasn't nice.
A few days later someone told me that Sue was actually a boy! That was supposed to be a joke from my "colleagues"! From that moment I felt like I had been in front of a video camera and the operator of it was me! I couldn't speak to anyone.
The worst thing in this story is that Pat told this to everyone at school.
From that moment I have lived alone.
Thanks to Pat.
I am writing to inform you about my disappointing evening which I spent at the play "Over The Rainbow" presented by The Circle Theatre.
The problems started at the beginning.
Although it said 19.30 in the advertisement, the play began at 20.15.
In addition, a different actor was starring instead of Danny Brooks and this was the most disappointing thing that evening for me and my friends.
I was told we would be able to get discounts, however, I could not get any.
I also went to your theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated.
As a result, I could not have my perfect evening out.
From the time she began university, the problems began.
She was telling the secrets of her friends to the others.
One day, her friends got fed up with this and ended their friendship.
Pam was sorry but there was nothing she could do about this.
Then she began to work at a company.
One day, she again told the secret formula for a product to a friend of hers.
Unfortunately, this friend told this to some other people and when it was understood that Pam was guilty, she was fired.
Life was harder than ever for Pam then.
She had no friends.
Nobody wanted to talk to her either.
One day, she moved to a farm and nobody has heard from her since then.
On your flyer I read that the actor was Danny Brook, but in the show there was a different actor: this is the first disappointing thing.
On the flyer I read that we could get some discounts, but it was not true.
Then after the show your theatre restaurant was closed because the staff were not there; so we could not visit it.
I expected you to provide "our perfect evening out" for us; but you did not, for unknown reasons.
Kim, her friend, used to go camping at Sunset Village every year, and that year Kim asked Pat to come with her.
She accepted.
When they returned to Caan, their town, they promised to keep silent about it.
But Pat, coming back home, told her mother everything.
That night Kim heard another scream and the day after she ran to Pat to tell her what she heard.
But neither Kim nor anyone else found Pat.
I'm a tourist and I had a week's holiday in London some time ago.
I had wanted to see the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented some nights ago; and the actor Danny Brook's performance.
I went to the theatre at 19.30 but, to my surprise, the show started at 20:15 and so I couldn't remain there until the end because I had to leave London, with my group before the end of the show.
The star, the actor Danny Brook, wasn't in the musical show but there was another actor, to my great disappointment.
Then, in the programme I could read about a discount available on the tickets, for groups, but I couldn't get that.
I couldn't have all the things I expected.
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied with your information and I ask for some money back.
I hope about this.
Some days ago, when school was coming to an end, Pat and her friends decided to throw a party for their friend, Frances, because the end of the school term and Francis's birthday were on the same day.
That should have been a secret for Francis - and they decided on the and the present, a new gold watch.
I am writing to complain about the musical show that has recently taken place at the Circle Theatre.
The advertisement I had read did not tally with the performance.
First of all, Danny Brook was not starring and was replaced by a different actor.
That was very disappointing.
The performance started forty-five minutes late.
Moreover, I was unpleasantly surprised to find no discounts were available.
Furthermore, I would not be complaining if the theatre restaurant had been open.
According to the advertisement, I could visit it after the show, but it was closed because of the lack of customers.
My "perfect evening out" was not so perfect and could not satisfy me in any way.
, the partial refund of the cost of the tickets, which are enclosed with this letter, would completely satisfy my .
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Modern technology has a variety of uses and its possibilities are being widened more and more.
Today it is used practically in all spheres and its influence on people is not unnoticeable.
Personally I feel the greatest influence personal computers.
Their popularity can be explained by their and ease of use.
With the help of the "Internet" it is possible to get a lot of objective and useful information you are interested in.
Computers take up the major part of my free time and this is a cause of disagreements between me and my parents.
They would like me to go for a walk more often or to help them in their daily chores.
I am completely satisfied with the way I spend my free time, but they have another opinion.
In conclusion, modern technology affects everybody, but in different ways.
The only effect on me is more frequent disagreements with my parents.
I'm telling you - the trip was wonderful and I'm sure your group will like it.
Especially because the prices are reasonable and if you have a group of 15 people, you get a discount.
Suddenly, I heard a strange sound behind me.
I turned around quickly, but there was nothing - the sound had disappeared.
I began to feel a bit scared, not that I was afraid of ghosts, but...I had the impression that something was wrong.
I stopped and listened.
Nothing.
A complete silence.
After a minute I started walking up the stairs again and I heard the same sound - it was the sound of footsteps! I was so frightened that I could barely move, but I turned my head again.
There was nobody there.
But something had changed - the kitchen door was wide open.
"That's right.
But haven't you just said you've seen a GHOST?" - she asked and looked at me as if I had lost my mind.
I went on a boat trip with my class last month and it was very exciting and interesting.
We were also very lucky with the weather; it was warm and sunny so we could admire the picturesque views all day long.
I think you should definitely go and I'll try to help in any way I can.
First of all I recommend you go on the 8 a.m.
boat.
It might mean waking up early but it will be less crowded and more comfortable on the trip.
In my opinion a guided tour is essential, because Bourne Castle is a historical place with galleries full of unique works of art and you will need a guide to explain everything thoroughly and answer all your questions.
I think you should take a packed lunch with you, because the restaurant is far too expensive and the portions are too small (you'll get very tired walking around the castle).
I advise you to try the water sports as well.
It's a real laugh.
I can honestly say: I could.
I like TV, I watch it but luckily I haven't become a TV addict yet.
Well, maybe only yet.
When do we turn on our TV set? When we are bored and lonely or on the other hand when we are tired of doing something we dislike.
So if I lived without television for a week I'd find something else to keep me busy: invite some friends around, read a good interesting book, go bowling or to a swimming pool.
This summer I lived in a complete TV vacuum for three weeks.
I forgot it had ever existed.
I just didn't have time for it, didn't allow it to enter my life.
And no, it wasn't a self-made torture.
I was just having a good time and I didn't need television to support me and keep me company in the dark summer evenings.
The biggest difference the absence of TV made in my life was that I actually started living.
I think everyone can say "no" to TV because humans' will is far stronger than the invisible hands that lure us into their cave.
And it'll be good for you as well, after a week without TV you'll begin to appreciate it and your life a lot more.
Many thanks for your letter, which arrived just when I was thinking of you.
I hope you and your family are feeling well.
I remember that I agreed to look after your flat while you are in New York on holiday.
The only problem is that on 4th April I have my graduation.
As you know I'm in Ferndown now spending the last minutes studying for exams.
I would like to ask you if my arrival at 4 o'clock on the 5th April is convenient for you.
If not, please let me know.
I'm sure we will find another solution.
Can you also let me know when you are going to come back on the 20th? Will it be dinnertime perhaps? If so, great! I will be able to see you.
You know that helping you is a real pleasure for me.
You really don't have to become flat broke from buying things for me but I am interested in American culture.
So a tiny "Statue of Liberty" will be nice.
I will finish now as I have a mountain of work to do.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
In today's fast-moving world young people spend less and less time cooking or eating healthy food.
When they are at home, , parents take care of them and always prepare a good dinner with meat or a fresh salad for supper.
However, students who never have time for a healthy diet full of minerals, vitamins and fibre usually on "McDonalds" and hamburgers or Big Macs.
Moreover, very often the school canteen doesn't offer varied types of food, like different kinds of bread or salads.
Usually we don't eat regularly or in good .
Our grandparents always remembered the value and quality of food.
They found time to eat something hot for dinner - the main meal - and even though the times were poorer, people were more sensible.
In my opinion people, especially the young, should become more aware of what and when they eat and they should their lifestyles and .
By the way, if you tell me around what time you will be back on the 20th, maybe I can prepare something for dinner.
I know you're going to be too tired to cook after 11 hours of flying.
With regards to your advertisement in "The Traveller" magazine, I would be pleased to tell you why I want to apply for this .
I am generally known as an easy-going person and I can remain calm in emergency situations and I am quite reliable too.
Obviously a sailing trip the most comfortable conditions but I think this makes the idea more exciting.
I believe that facing difficulties will make me more mature in the real world and having friends from all over the world will help me to think "globally".
Our English club is not a very big one, with 14 students and a teacher.
Most of the students are between 18 and 22 years old, but there are some older students.
The eldest is 28 years old.
We all love to learn English.
At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech.
You can tell us about whatever you like.
For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice.
I'm planning the event for 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m.
Please tell me which day is good for you.
After the event, I'd like to offer you dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college.
I had never taken birthdays seriously, neither my own nor those of others, until I had that really special day on my twenty-fourth birthday.
When I was 23, I joined an NGO in Denmark and started living with other members, most of whom are from Europe.
On that day, I noticed that they were preparing something for me and that reminded me that it was my birthday.
I had never had a birthday party before and I didn't expect much.
The party was far beyond my expectations.
Twenty people from five different countries celebrated with me.
I had never felt happier.
