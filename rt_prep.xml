<p><NS type="RT"><i>Because of</i><c>For</c></NS> the <NS type="AGN"><i>reason</i><c>reasons</c></NS> above, I, indeed, spent <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> awful last night in London.</p>
<p>I WANT TO <NS type="S"><i>THAK</i><c>THANK</c></NS> YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US <NS type="RT"><i>TO</i><c>ON</c></NS> THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH. IT <NS type="RV"><i>CONSISTS <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS></i><c>INVOLVES</c></NS> VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> ENGLISH LANGUAGE. <NS type="ID"><i>ON THE OTHER HAND</i><c>ALSO</c></NS>, WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL.</p>
<p>FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION. AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY <NS type="RV"><i>ACT</i><c>BEHAVE</c></NS> IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>FOR</c></NS> INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON <NS type="FN"><i>HOLIDAYS</i><c>HOLIDAY</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> it is more suitable for me. I think I will really enjoy <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if I <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i> it</i><c>.  It</c></NS> is going to be a new experience and looks exciting.</p>
<p>About the activities while at the Camp<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>enjoy</i><c>do</c></NS> swimming, not because I am good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it, just because I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> keen on <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> and the other one is Photography.</p>
<p>Last month, I enjoyed <NS type="FV"><i>to help</i><c>helping</c></NS> at a pop concert in Portugal. Everything <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> new for me. I had to <NS type="R">(lyd)</NS> tidy up the place where they have to wait <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>for</c></NS> their turn. The group asked me <NS type="FV"><i>make</i><c>to make</c></NS> sure that in the fridge they always could find a <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>wide</c></NS> variety of drinks including honey and lemon for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> throat.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Other</i><c>The other</c></NS> thing I had to do <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> keep an eye <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the towels, I mean, <NS type="RJ"><i>dried</i><c>dry</c></NS> towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>and</c></NS> they have to change <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> clothes and <NS type="AGV"><i>looks</i><c>look</c></NS> fresh; don't ask me why.</p>
<p>The festival was <NS type="S"><i>excenent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> in many ways, and <NS type="RY"><i>especially</i><c>in particular</c></NS> it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>proper</i><c>normal</c></NS> price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.</p>
<p>However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars  <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of <NS type="RN"><i>audiences</i><c>attendees</c></NS>. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="X"><i>neither the films nor</i><c>either the films or</c></NS> the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more <NS type="UQ"><i>numbers of</i></NS> plays and films next year.</p>
<p>Above all, realistic stories teach me something <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.</p>
<p>The musical should <NS type="TV"><i>started</i><c>have started</c></NS> at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. When I went to <NS type="FV"><i>asked</i><c>ask</c></NS> for the discount <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> ticket <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the cashier desk they told me no discount <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> available <NS type="U"><i>for this</i></NS>. I had seen the advertisement <NS type="FV"><i>say</i><c>saying</c></NS> that <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> available.</p>
<p>I think in the next 100 years people will wear <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="DN">space clothes</NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> small engine in the back<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the earth <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> now <NS type="RV"><i>starting</i><c>deteriorating</c></NS> badly every <NS type="AGN"><i>years</i><c>year</c></NS>.</p>
<p>MY NAME <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> JAMES CAMIREZ AND <NS type="UP"><i>I'AM</i><c>I AM</c></NS> WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME <NS type="S"><i>COMPLEINTS</i><c>COMPLAINTS</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>FOR</i><c>REGARDING</c></NS> THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT.</p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT <NS type="TV"><i>SAYS</i><c>SAID</c></NS> THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM <NS type="MY"><c>THERE</c></NS> WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING!</p>
<p>THEN I READ <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE ADVERTISEMENT, <NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS>DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS>, AND I DIDN'T <NS type="FV"><i>GOT</i><c>GET</c></NS> ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM.</p>
<p>On Wednesday after <NS type="M"><c>we have</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>viseted</i><c>visited</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>national</i><c>National</c></NS> Art Gallery, we can have a chat about <NS type="DD"><i>ours</i><c>our</c></NS> next holiday <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>during</c></NS> the free time in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The advertisement that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> students saw is <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need <NS type="FV"><i>cancel</i><c>to cancel</c></NS> the tour on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00.</p>
<p>It is really interesting how people like <NS type="FV"><i>knowing</i><c>to know</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> famous <NS type="MP"><i>people</i><c>people's</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>. Without someone famous <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>knowing</c></NS>, <NS type="RN"><i>photographs</i><c>photographers</c></NS> take pictures secretly, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> try to get money <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that moment she understood that something was wrong!</p>
<p>Thank you for organising <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good programme, <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> especially like <NS type="R">sightseeing from River trip to Greenwich</NS> in London for three days. I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> the information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> and to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>huggest</i><c>suggest</c></NS></i><c>offer</c></NS> our opinion.</p>
<p>Whenever I <NS type="S"><i>recollet</i><c>recollect</c></NS> it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Army, I was able to apply to <NS type="M"><c>join the</c></NS> Korea Auxiliary Police.</p>
<p>As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. Is <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> suitable for you?</p>
<p>I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to <NS type="FV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> just two of them because in my opinion I'm good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> almost <NS type="MQ"><c>all</c></NS> of <NS type="AGQ"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>facinating</i><c>fascinating</c></NS></i><c>fascinated</c></NS> with the sea and <NS type="RP"><i>it's</i><c>its</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>misteries</i><c>mysteries</c></NS> and I also like the <NS type="S"><i>watter</i><c>water</c></NS>, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> I'm tall and very fast with the ball.</p>
<p>I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>one month</i><c>one-month</c></NS> break <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> July, so please <NS type="RV"><i>make my log cabin ready</i><c>book my log cabin</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer <NS type="FV"><i>stay</i><c>to stay</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> cabin because I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> some experience <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> tents <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> my childhood and it was not <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very good experience<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> therefore I would like to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> cabin.</p>
<p>Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. <NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>First</c></NS>, we couldn't get <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>a</c></NS> discount, although you mention it <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>. And the only tickets left were <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> £20. Then the <NS type="RN"><i>spectacle</i><c>show</c></NS> began 45 minutes later than <NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>stated</c></NS>. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. <NS type="UY"><i>Afterwards we</i><c>We</c></NS> are used to <NS type="FV"><i>eat</i><c>eating</c></NS> at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good <NS type="UN"><i>price</i></NS> value but also for it's original <NS type="RN"><i>decoration</i><c>decor</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was <NS type="RV"><i>following</i><c>doing</c></NS> a course all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> week in Berne. The kids were <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> their grandmother, who <NS type="AGV"><i>take</i><c>takes</c></NS> care of them.</p>
<p>I drove to Ouchy where I <NS type="RV"><i>took</i><c>had</c></NS> a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>swimming-clothes</i><c>swimming costume</c></NS>. I knew a good place. I parked the car and <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>waited</c></NS> ten <NS type="S"><i>minuts</i><c>minutes</c></NS>. As I had <NS type="IV"><i>planed</i><c>planned</c></NS>, the place was deserted. I took my clothes <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>off</c></NS> and swam <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come <NS type="S"><i>accross</i><c>across</c></NS> anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In the name of</i><c>On behalf of</c></NS> the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a <NS type="S"><i>galery</i><c>gallery</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RV"><i>Could</i><c>Would</c></NS> it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping <NS type="RN">time</NS> and to replace them <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> the London Show? We <NS type="RV"><i>may</i><c>could</c></NS> go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon <NS type="M"><c>during our</c></NS> free time.</p>
<p>It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim <NS type="RT"><i>in the middle of</i><c>with</c></NS> sharks.</p>
<p>One Saturday I got <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>into</c></NS> my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks.</p>
<p>I went to your show called "Over The Rainbow" and I was really <NS type="RJ"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>by</c></NS> many <NS type="RN"><i>points</i><c>things</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started <NS type="R">at this time</NS>. I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me <NS type="UY"><i>yet</i></NS> but when I came <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and <NS type="S"><i>suddently</i><c>suddenly</c></NS> left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RJ"><i>all the</i><c>whole the</c></NS></i><c>the whole</c></NS> story. She said that I had to be strong and <NS type="UV"><i>didn't</i><c>not</c></NS> care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to <NS type="FV"><i>stopped</i><c>stop</c></NS> because he loved me and wanted to be with me. <NS type="R"><i>At this time</i><c>Then</c></NS> all the girls became jealous and stopped <NS type="FV"><i>to laugh</i><c>laughing</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes.</p>
<p>Since we <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> kids people <NS type="TV"><i>tell</i><c>have told</c></NS> us stories <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> two sides in <NS type="S"><i>conflit</i><c>conflict</c></NS>: the good and the bad side. The good always <NS type="AGV"><i>wins</i><c>win</c></NS>, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting?</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the tale "It's a good life", the author gives much more emphasis to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and <NS type="RJ">uningative</NS>. He controls the other people using the power of his mind.</p>
<p>Although the other people <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the story are the good ones and suffer <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>from</c></NS> his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> us by the author.</p>
<p>First thing is <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> computer. When I was a university student, I had to find out some <NS type="S"><i>imformation</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> my homework. I could not get <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS>. but a computer <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>allowed</c></NS> me <NS type="FV"><i>get</i><c>to get</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I have recently been <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening.</p>
<p>I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> that there were some discounts available. I asked <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> it but the answer I received was that there <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> any kind of <NS type="AGN"><i>discount</i><c>discounts</c></NS>. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant <NS type="MN"><c>idea</c></NS> to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!</p>
<p>The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> fantastic cappuccino with my <NS type="S"><i>coffe</i><c>coffee</c></NS> machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> my office is to switch on my computer. <NS type="UT"><i>During all</i><c>All</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> day I speak with the majority of my <NS type="S"><i>collegues</i><c>colleagues</c></NS> by telephone or e-mail. <NS type="RY"><i>Sometime</i><c>Sometimes</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>stay</i><c>am</c></NS> alone all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> day but I have <NS type="FN"><i>contacts</i><c>contact</c></NS> with many people.</p>
<p>First of all I want to thank you for the <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme that you <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>mack</i><c>make</c></NS></i><c>made</c></NS></i><c>arranged</c></NS> for my class in such a short time. The students are especially <NS type="UY"><i>very</i></NS> happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>make</c></NS> on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> morning <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> 14th March.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the show is going to take place on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your programme. My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> is the last day that the show is going to be <NS type="RV">showed</NS>.</p>
<p>What about rooms which can <NS type="RV"><i>feel</i><c>sense</c></NS> your mood and <NS type="FV"><i>acting</i><c>act</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>according to</c></NS> that<NS type="RP"><i>, if</i><c>? If</c></NS> you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing <NS type="S"><i>musik</i><c>music</c></NS> on and turn down the light a little bit. <NS type="MD"><i>Next</i><c>The next</c></NS> step might be a robot<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which would do all your housework, but what would <NS type="FV"><i>happened</i><c>happen</c></NS> to the people?</p>
<p>I think that everyone should <NS type="W"><i>not think</i><c>think not</c></NS> just about the positive <NS type="FN"><i>sides</i><c>side</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>technologi</i><c>technology</c></NS> but also the negative.</p>
<p>I find it unbearable to witness such <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>lying</i><c>deceitful</c></NS> advertising and to <NS type="W"><i>pay even</i><c>even pay</c></NS> ten pounds to <NS type="RV"><i>spend</i><c>have</c></NS> such a disappointing evening. Consequently, I ask for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> money back, and I will <NS type="W"><i>not obviously</i><c>obviously not</c></NS> go back <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the Circle Theatre. I <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>attach</c></NS> my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>has</c></NS> caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested <NS type="U"><i>in it</i></NS>, and decided to lead her own enquiry <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>into</c></NS> this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story <NS type="RV"><i>looked</i><c>seemed</c></NS> very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat <NS type="RV"><i>reached</i><c>achieved</c></NS> her purpose by <NS type="W"><i>questioning carefully</i><c>carefully questioning</c></NS> her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to <NS type="RV"><i>rob</i><c>steal</c></NS> this camera <NS type="R"><i>unless</i><c>or else</c></NS> he <NS type="RV"><i>wanted</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to be</i><c>be</c></NS> hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the <NS type="W"><i>adults' help</i><c>the help of adults</c></NS>. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She <NS type="MV"><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>convicted the two criminals</i><c>the two criminals convicted</c></NS>, and <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>recovered</c></NS> the calm <NS type="UV"><i>gone back</i></NS> within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> telling a secret, and she realized she had made <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> good choice.</p>
<p>We are all looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> answer.</p>
<p>I decided to do something <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> this man<NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> first move was to check <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>was there</i><c>there was</c></NS> any solid or liquid which could <NS type="TV"><i>blocked</i><c>have blocked</c></NS> his <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>breathe</i><c>breathing</c></NS></i><c>airways</c></NS>. And <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>checking</i><c>checked</c></NS> his <NS type="R">body condition</NS>. After that I turned on the <NS type="MP"><i>car</i><c>car's</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>light</i><c>lights</c></NS> in order to <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>warn</c></NS> the passing cars.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry they were not <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this road<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>. They</c></NS> were <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RJ">next</NS> road.</p>
<p>AS YOU KNOW, I AM A SOUND <NS type="S"><i>TECHNICH</i><c>TECHNICIAN</c></NS>, SO I <NS type="TV"><i>HELP</i><c>HELPED</c></NS> THEM TO <NS type="RV"><i>PUT</i><c>SET UP</c></NS> THE SOUND <NS type="CN"><i>EQUIPMENTS</i><c>EQUIPMENT</c></NS> AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY. THEN SOME HOURS BEFORE THE CONCERT, I MET THE BAND AND THEY LET ME <NS type="FV"><i>STAYED</i><c>STAY</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>FOR</c></NS> THE SOUND <NS type="RN"><i>TEST</i><c>CHECK</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>IT</c></NS> WAS <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>ALREADY</i><c>REALLY</c></NS> SPECIAL TIME FOR ME! THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND WERE VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY <NS type="RT"><i>WITH</i><c>TO</c></NS> ME.</p>
<p>THEN, WHEN THE CONCERT STARTED<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> THE ORGANISERS GAVE ME AN IDENTITY CARD, <NS type="M"><c>WHICH WAS</c></NS> ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE STAFF. THAT CARD WAS THE BEST THING THAT SOMEONE HAD EVER <NS type="TV"><i>GAVE</i><c>GIVEN</c></NS> TO ME, BECAUSE I WAS <NS type="RJ"><i>UNABLE</i><c>ABLE</c></NS> TO BE <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> THE <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>SCENARY</i><c>SCENERY</c></NS></i><c>STAGE</c></NS> WITH THE WHOLE BAND! IT WAS THE BEST TIME <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>OF</c></NS> MY LIFE. I FELT REALLY LUCKY.</p>
<p>Secondly the show <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was meant</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>start</c></NS></i><c>to start</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any <NS type="FN"><i>explanations</i><c>explanation</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of <NS type="AGN"><i>gadgets</i><c>gadget</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> old clothes, like a dress <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>middle-Age</i><c>Middle Ages</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which informed me that I have won the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Here <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> some information as requested.</p>
<p>Shopping is an ordinary <NS type="RN">way of life</NS>. We always need fresh food such as vegetables, <NS type="FN"><i>fruits</i><c>fruit</c></NS>, milk <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> etc. <NS type="RY">At least</NS> most people will do their shopping twice a week for <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> always enjoyable. You have to try to park your <NS type="S"><i>cark</i><c>car</c></NS> first<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>which</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>sometime</i><c>sometimes</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>space</i><c>car parks</c></NS> are <NS type="DJ"><i>fulled</i><c>full</c></NS> and after you have parked your car and <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>went</i><c>gone</c></NS></i><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> the supermarket the product you wanted <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> run out so you have to <NS type="FV"><i>changes</i><c>change</c></NS> your plan for dinner or <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> to another supermarket to <NS type="FV"><i>facing</i><c>face</c></NS> a long queue. <NS type="RP"><i>that</i><c>That</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> <NS type="R">you whole day for shopping</NS> which was not fun at all.</p>
<p>Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> the <NS type="DN">promotion paper</NS> said they <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>gave</c></NS> discounts to people <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got <NS type="W"><i>late to the show</i><c>to the show late</c></NS>, when I got to my <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>seat</c></NS>, it was <NS type="RV"><i>used</i><c>taken</c></NS> (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>seat</c></NS> the show started<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>find</i><c>found</c></NS></i><c>discovered</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS> that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor.</p>
<p>That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>climbed</c></NS> out <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> my window. I had told Pat to pick me up<NS type="RP"><i>, she</i><c>. She</c></NS> was the only one <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>new</i><c>knew</c></NS> my plan. I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret. So when we arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the disco there was my guy waiting for me. To <NS type="S"><i>sumarize</i><c>summarise</c></NS> the night<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am going steady with him, and he took me home. The next morning Pat came to my house<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive <NS type="MN"><c>home</c></NS> last night?...</p>
<p>I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my <NS type="RN"><i>tests</i><c>exams</c></NS>. I will <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> F.C.E <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> University of Cambridge and other <NS type="RN"><i>tests</i><c>exams</c></NS> in several subjects <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> my high school.</p>
<p>Among those activities <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>from which</c></NS> you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is <NS type="R"><i>my</i><c>a</c></NS> challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it.</p>
<p>I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> that. Here is the information you want, I hope <NS type="AGA"><i>they</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> useful.</p>
<p>First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June. And in August, I have to go back to school to do some <NS type="FN"><i>classes</i><c>class</c></NS> work and I have got a camp to organise. So I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> in tents. Since I haven't been camping in tents <NS type="UY"><i>so</i></NS> I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what <NS type="AS"><i>will it be</i><c>it is like</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="ID">By the following</NS>, I would like to inform you that <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>I've assisted</i><c>I've attended</c></NS></i><c>I attended</c></NS> your new musical show, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>which name</i><c>name of which</c></NS> is "Over the rainbow", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you to make a complaint <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> your advertisement, which I consider <NS type="UT"><i>like</i></NS> a lying advertisement. Let me explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you why I'm now so disappointed. <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>I've spent</i><c>I spent</c></NS></i><c>I had</c></NS> one <NS type="MP"><i>week</i><c>week's</c></NS> holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had <NS type="S"><i>preparred</i><c>prepared</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> a long time ago, this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> to the capital and <NS type="RV"><i>spared</i><c>saved</c></NS> a lot of money as well.</p>
<p>Please find enclosed my <NS type="RN"><i>thinking</i><c>thoughts</c></NS> about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the <NS type="RN"><i>manner</i><c>way</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RY"><i>actually</i><c>at present</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>how the</i></NS> people are dressing</i><c>people are dressing at present</c></NS> to see how it's going to be <NS type="IV"><i>developped</i><c>developed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> the future. Everyone has <NS type="SX"><i>is</i><c>his</c></NS> own style but it's obvious that many of us <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> wearing the same clothes <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing <NS type="UP"><i>short-trousers</i><c>short trousers</c></NS> and yesterday <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was wearing <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="UP"><i>broken-jeans</i><c>broken jeans</c></NS></i><c>torn jeans</c></NS>. What we wear is also influenced by models, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>medias</i><c>media</c></NS>, or new <NS type="AGN"><i>collection</i><c>collections</c></NS>, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that's</i><c>which's</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="MY"><c>why</c></NS> maybe</i><c>maybe why</c></NS> not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that <NS type="R"><i>each people</i><c>everyone</c></NS> will <NS type="S"><i>developp</i><c>develop</c></NS> his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> everything possible, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>as</c></NS> a way to create <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> own clothes.</p>
<p>Finally, <NS type="DT"><i>concerned</i><c>concerning</c></NS> the price <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less <NS type="DJ"><i>stress</i><c>stressed</c></NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>so</i><c>because</c></NS> they can visit <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="IY"><i>more longer</i><c>longer</c></NS>. It <NS type="TV"><i>will be</i><c>would be</c></NS> better<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if we <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>hold</c></NS> this festival at the end of summer. I hope <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to give</i><c>have given</c></NS> you enough information.</p>
<p>It began when my <NS type="FN"><i>parent</i><c>parents</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>sand</i><c>and</c></NS> I were going to the South of France for <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> holidays. We <NS type="RV"><i>took</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> car. When we were near Geneva, my father<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who was driving the car, <NS type="TV"><i>had been flashed</i><c>was flashed</c></NS> by a radar and the police stopped him. After that, <NS type="MC"><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="AS"><i>it <NS type="IV"><i>maked</i><c>made</c></NS> a long time that he drove</i><c>he had been driving for a long time</c></NS>, <NS type="UC"><i>so</i></NS> we decided to stop <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>service</c></NS> area. We <NS type="TV"><i>were going</i><c>went</c></NS> to the toilet and ate something <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>had forgotten</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>close</i><c>lock</c></NS> the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the <NS type="CN"><i>luggages</i><c>luggage</c></NS>. We called the police but they said <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> us <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> if <NS type="RA"><i>you</i><c>we</c></NS> didn't <NS type="RV"><i>close</i><c>lock</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>our</c></NS> car <NS type="RA"><i>we</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>didn't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Secondary</i><c>Secondly</c></NS>, the advertising <NS type="RV"><i>shows</i><c>states</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> the musical <NS type="AGV"><i>start</i><c>starts</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20:15<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RA"><i>it's</i><c>that's</c></NS></i><c>. That's</c></NS> 45 <NS type="S"><i>minuts</i><c>minutes</c></NS> late, and also<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>I'd asked</i><c>I asked</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>for a</c></NS> discount ticket <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the ticket counter, but <NS type="AS"><i>there <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> not available any discount tickets</i><c>no discount tickets were available</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> "Over The Rainbow", which <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>organised</i><c>performed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was <NS type="AGQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor instead of him, which <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>was</c></NS> to me as a great disappointment</i><c>was a great disappointment to me</c></NS>. Secondly, as for the times <NS type="M"><c>of the performance</c></NS>, instead of 19.30 it <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> started at 20:15, which <NS type="RV"><i>involved</i><c>meant</c></NS> being stranded <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre for such a long time. <NS type="ID"><i>Added to this</i><c>In addition</c></NS>, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. <NS type="RY"><i>Nevertheless</i><c>However</c></NS>, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a full refund or at least <NS type="R"><i>part</i><c>some</c></NS> of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI</p>
<p>Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I <NS type="RV"><i>determined</i><c>decided</c></NS> to fall out with her. Since then, I <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="S"><i>hasen't</i><c>hasn't</c></NS></i><c>haven't</c></NS> talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. <NS type="ID">Of course</NS>, I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and <NS type="AGQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>after</c></NS> we had quarrelled was: "It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!"</p>
<p>I am really happy to get such wonderful news from you. In order to <NS type="MV"><c>claim</c></NS> the prize, I would like to travel, if it is possible, <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I am a student and my <NS type="RN"><i>winter</i><c>summer</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>brake</i><c>break</c></NS> is <NS type="UV"><i>taking place</i></NS> during <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month, July.</p>
<p>I would <NS type="RV"><i>prepare</i><c>prefer</c></NS> to stay in a cabin because I have not <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>had</c></NS> really</i><c>really had</c></NS> good experiences <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> camping in tents<NS type="RP"><i>, last</i><c>. Last</c></NS> time a bear came inside while I was in <NS type="M"><c>the tent</c></NS>. I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp<NS type="RP"><i>, by</i><c>. By</c></NS> the way<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my team and I won the last <NS type="S"><i>scholl</i><c>school</c></NS> championship<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I play guard on my team<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I also like tennis but I am not very good<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was wondering if you could give me some <NS type="AGN"><i>lesson</i><c>lessons</c></NS> while I am there.</p>
<p>This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have <NS type="TV"><i>develop</i><c>developed</c></NS> such an <NS type="S"><i>instinc</i><c>instinct</c></NS> for shopping that we can proudly say<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that we are some sort of kings <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the urban jungle.</p>
<p>But where is the bad <NS type="RN"><i>poet</i><c>part</c></NS> of it<NS type="RP"><i>, well</i><c>? Well</c></NS> shopping can became horrible <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>christmast</i><c>Christmas</c></NS> for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>houndred</i><c>hundred</c></NS></i><c>hundreds</c></NS> of people <NS type="AGV"><i>goes</i><c>go</c></NS> to the shopping <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> and it also can <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>cause</c></NS> many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.</p>
<p>About <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> nature.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> human <NS type="MN"><c>history</c></NS> and that without it we couldn't be where we are <NS type="S"><i>wright</i><c>right</c></NS> now.</p>
<p>I would like to do singing and swimming. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very <NS type="CQ"><i>few</i><c>little</c></NS> experience in it.</p>
<p>Concerning swimming, I <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>do</c></NS> this sport once a week <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer!</p>
<p>But technology doesn't only <NS type="AGV"><i>makes</i><c>make</c></NS> my life better. By <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>using</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> car I <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> not only get an easy way to move <NS type="MY"><c>around</c></NS>, but I <NS type="MY"><c>also</c></NS> destroy <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>enviroment</i><c>environment</c></NS>. Also, if I use the car<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> small distances when I <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> go on foot, I <NS type="RV">destroy</NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>physical situation</i><c>health</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Technology is very important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> my life. It makes my life <NS type="IJ"><i>more easier</i><c>easier</c></NS>, and it would be much more difficult to live without it<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you to complain about the musical show which took place <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> last 1st of May <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> "the Circle Theatre" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was surprised <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> its facade and also I was anxious <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to see</c></NS> the beginning of the performance.</p>
<p>Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>a</c></NS> marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> us were not the same as the <NS type="M"><c>ones charged at the</c></NS> theatre<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> asked for our special discount for <NS type="FV"><i>be</i><c>being</c></NS> students <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> less than eighteen years but we only obtained a <NS type="DJ"><i>rudely</i><c>rude</c></NS> answer <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> the woman who sold the tickets.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>At top of everything</i><c>On top of everything</c></NS> the restaurant was closed and we could not eat <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre.</p>
<p>Nowadays we think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology as something usual in our lives.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>For instances</i><c>For instance</c></NS> with the <NS type="DN"><i>arrive</i><c>arrival</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet, the new digital television <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> the researchers in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>medecin</i><c>medicine</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> we are discovering how we can change our lives <NS type="W"><i>only with</i><c>with only</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> press <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>botton</i><c>button</c></NS>, or look for something new <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> only <NS type="FV"><i>think</i><c>thinking</c></NS> about it... we realize that the new technology <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> just begun <NS type="MV"><c>to advance</c></NS>, and <NS type="M"><c>it is</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>lively</i><c>likely</c></NS> in a few years we will be very <NS type="S"><i>avanced</i><c>advanced</c></NS> in this way.</p>
<p>But however<NS type="MP"></NS> it is a good idea to spend <NS type="SX"><i>out</i><c>our</c></NS> money <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>make</i></NS> new enterprises which pay <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> researchers <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>they</i><c>who</c></NS> could investigate how <NS type="M"><c>we could</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to improve</i><c>improve</c></NS> ourselves.</p>
<p>I asked <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them.</p>
<p>Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>promised</c></NS> and that we all <NS type="RV"><i>wished</i><c>wanted</c></NS> turned out to be <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>regret</i><c>regrettable</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm <NS type="RV"><i>including</i><c>enclosing</c></NS> my ticket and this list of complaints <NS type="R">as the reason for returning</NS> some money.</p>
<p>Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out <NS type="UY"><i>until</i></NS> later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet and its <NS type="RN"><i>arriving</i><c>arrival</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want.</p>
<p>In brief, <NS type="R"><i>my life is</i><c>I am</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>taking the most out of</i><c>making the most of</c></NS> the discoveries <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> science and technology and <NS type="ID"><i>it can't be hidden</i><c>I can't conceal</c></NS> that I'm really glad of that.</p>
<p>If it is possible I would like to travel in July because school is finishing on the 28th June and I have already <NS type="SX"><i>excepted</i><c>accepted</c></NS> a job <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> August.</p>
<p>At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf. I belonged to a climbing club at my <NS type="RP"><i>highschool</i><c>high school</c></NS> and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a <NS type="SA"><i>practicing</i><c>practising</c></NS> centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> golf.</p>
<p>There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement and <NS type="R">the ones it actually was</NS>. Firstly the <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS></i><c>stars</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the musical show. Secondly <NS type="R">time starts</NS> at 19:30 on the <NS type="S"><i>leafet</i><c>leaflet</c></NS> but it actually started at 20:15. Thirdly it said there were discounts available <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS>, there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not any at all. Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was <NS type="S"><i>colsed</i><c>closed</c></NS> because <NS type="R">your excuse of being used at that moment</NS>.</p>
<p>It said <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>leafet</i><c>leaflet</c></NS> that <NS type="R"><i>your</i><c>this would be a</c></NS> perfect evening out, while it was not <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> at all. I felt very <NS type="RJ"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> after seeing the music show in your theatre. <NS type="R">As I said the reasons above</NS>, I want to ask for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> money back! I look forwards to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was so kind that <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>he</c></NS> couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>stop</i><c>resist</c></NS> telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> After <NS type="RV"><i>finishing</i><c>doing</c></NS> that<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Pat left <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> room. Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart <NS type="RV"><i>throbbing</i><c>beating</c></NS> quickly. She went <NS type="W"><i>quietly <NS type="S"><i>downstair</i><c>downstairs</c></NS></i><c>downstairs quietly</c></NS> and closed the door as soon as she went into her room. At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which seemed <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>just happened</i><c>had just happened</c></NS> yesterday. "Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?" <NS type="RP"><i>She</i><c>she</c></NS> said to herself<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> "I am just a servant in this castle<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="AGV"><i>loves</i><c>love</c></NS> him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle." <NS type="UC"><i><NS type="RP"><i>while</i><c>While</c></NS> it</i><c>It</c></NS> seemed as <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> a shadow came in <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>through</c></NS> the window and disappeared quickly. Everything in the room <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> quiet except the sound of the clock<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as if everything <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> going to die. She was so <NS type="DJ"><i>frighten</i><c>frightened</c></NS> and sad that she had no <NS type="S"><i>energry</i><c>energy</c></NS>. She fell <NS type="UY"><i>down</i></NS> onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her.</p>
<p>I am Writing this letter to <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>express</c></NS> my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>entertament</i><c>entertainment</c></NS></i><c>show</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Fathermore</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, <NS type="X"><i>discounts <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> unavailable</i><c>no discounts were available</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>. Even</i><c>, even</c></NS> though we had a student card. In the advertisement they said that <NS type="FN"><i>tickets</i><c>ticket</c></NS> discounts <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> available. I think it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> a <NS type="DN">bombastic</NS>. Anyway I was so <NS type="DJ"><i>unpleasement</i><c>unhappy</c></NS>. It was not <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> marvellous evening. Could you <NS type="RV"><i>back</i><c>return</c></NS> my money please? You have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>responsoiblity</i><c>responsibility</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the audiences.</p>
<p>If I <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> addicted <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> problem. I do not want to spend much time <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> computers.</p>
<p>And you need some <NS type="S"><i>imformation</i><c>information</c></NS> from me. About when would I like to go<NS type="RP"><i>? <NS type="UC"><i>And</i></NS></i><c>,</c></NS> I think I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> love <NS type="RP"><i>togo</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good time for camping and the weather is lovely at this time of the year.</p>
<p>And the most important reason is because <NS type="UP"><i>I'</i><c>I</c></NS> am still a student. And I study at London International School. So July is my end of year holiday. So I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> be happy to go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS>. And about the accommodation at camp<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to <NS type="FV"><i>stays</i><c>stay</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent because it <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> more <NS type="M"><c>of a</c></NS> feeling <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> adventure that's <NS type="TV"><i>call</i><c>called</c></NS> camping.

So I will choose two activities that I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> good at and not good at. The first one is the one that I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> good at <NS type="M"><c>and it</c></NS> is Basketball. I <NS type="DY"><i>use</i><c>usually</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to play</i><c>play</c></NS> basketball at school and play for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> school team. And the second <NS type="AGN"><i>activities</i><c>activity</c></NS> is the one that I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> not good at <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>never try</i><c>have never tried</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> before is surfing. I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> love to try surfing because it is a very <NS type="S"><i>interessting</i><c>interesting</c></NS> sport and <NS type="AGV"><i>use</i><c>uses</c></NS> a lot of power and <NS type="S"><i>enigy</i><c>energy</c></NS> so now is the end of the letter. And I want to know more about the money<NS type="MP"><i> can</i><c>. Can</c></NS> you give me more <NS type="S"><i>imformation</i><c>information</c></NS> about the money that I need to bring <NS type="S"><i>whith</i><c>with</c></NS> me<NS type="MP"><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p>I want to ask you to come to our party and also to help us <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> what present <NS type="W"><i><NS type="TV"><i>shall</i><c>should</c></NS> we</i><c>we should</c></NS> buy for Mr. Brown.</p>
<p>I live in Greece, and <NS type="RY"><i>especially</i><c>to be exact</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> an island, so I know very well what summer means. It means swimming at the <NS type="DJ"><i>wonderfull</i><c>wonderful</c></NS> beaches, tasting the delicious <NS type="CN"><i>foods</i><c>food</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>ad</i><c>and</c></NS> having <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> wonderful time every day and every night with your friends.</p>
<p>Also it means <NS type="FV"><i>to meet</i><c>meeting</c></NS> other people, <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>having</c></NS> fun together, <NS type="FV"><i>to travel</i><c>travelling</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> all the places <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> the island. I think that the summer makes people <NS type="FV"><i>to feel</i><c>feel</c></NS> great, <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>have</c></NS> fun, <NS type="FV"><i>to enjoy</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> themselves. I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>they</c></NS> go.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I was reading when I suddenly <NS type="SX"><i>hard</i><c>heard</c></NS> a big bang. I looked out through the window and saw a big strange "thing". It looked like a floating potato, a brown potato. After that a being <NS type="S"><i>climed</i><c>climbed</c></NS> out <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the potato. It looked at me and said.</p>
<p>I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my <NS type="RN"><i>main-teacher</i><c>head teacher</c></NS> walking through the door with the being <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>behind</c></NS> him. The being moved its hand <NS type="S"><i>farward</i><c>forward</c></NS> and.....</p>
<p>I am writing to thank <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> for <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>the</c></NS> interesting and excellent programme<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that you <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> organised, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> especially <NS type="RT"><i>concerning</i><c>for</c></NS> the opportunity to visit the National Art Gallery and the Science Museum.</p>
<p>Peter, my husband, was a tall, strong man in his <NS type="DN"><i>mid-forty</i><c>mid-forties</c></NS>. We used to <NS type="RV"><i>remember</i><c>recount</c></NS> our <NS type="RN"><i>daytime</i><c>day</c></NS> before <NS type="RV"><i>felling</i><c>falling</c></NS> asleep. As a postman, Peter<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> had to deliver letters <NS type="S"><i>aroud</i><c>around</c></NS> our little village. He knew everybody, <NS type="R"><i>especially</i><c>including</c></NS> Mrs Rilke, an elderly, eagle-eyed <NS type="W"><i>teacher <NS type="DJ"><i>in retirement</i><c>retired</c></NS></i><c>retired teacher</c></NS>, who lived in <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> old cottage with her five bad-tempered dogs. She <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>had</c></NS> never received any <NS type="FN"><i>letter</i><c>letters</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>till</c></NS> that morning.</p>
<p>I received your letter. I do not want to keep you curious any longer. The <NS type="S"><i>oppurnity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance. I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert. I, <NS type="RP"><i>ofcourse</i><c>of course</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> jumped <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>at</c></NS> it. The idea of meeting a <NS type="W"><i>worldwide known pop singer</i><c>pop singer known worldwide</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> just made my heart punch my ribcage. The concert <NS type="MN"></NS> was <NS type="DY"><i>all ready</i><c>already</c></NS> filled up with thousands <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS>, although it was really early. We, the volunteers<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> first unravelled the cables, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> set <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> the microphones and some instruments. Then we<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> were told go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>back stage</i><c>backstage</c></NS> and make sure everything was perfect. After a fantastic concert<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears. She is a very nice person<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I managed to <NS type="S"><i>scavange</i><c>scavenge</c></NS> an <NS type="S"><i>authograph</i><c>autograph</c></NS> for you as well<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I will put it in the envelope.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you because my class want to give a surprise birthday party for your husband Mr Brown. We need your help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the details.</p>
<p>Family life <NS type="DY"><i>in our days</i><c>nowadays</c></NS> is very important because both <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> parents work and they haven't any time for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> children. In addition <NS type="IN"><i>childrens</i><c>children</c></NS> have so <NS type="AGQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> lessons at school that they <NS type="AGV"><i>doesn't</i><c>don't</c></NS> have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> home.</p>
<p>In <NS type="S"><i>spide</i><c>spite</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> that fact there are of course many families <NS type="DY"><i>especialy</i><c>especially</c></NS> in small towns <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> eat lunch all together and <NS type="SX"><i>they</i><c>then</c></NS> they solve their problem all together. Parents play with <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> children and have fun. And the difference <NS type="SX"><i>in</i><c>is</c></NS> that <NS type="MD"><c>those</c></NS> children <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="DY"><i>effectivily</i><c>effectively</c></NS></i><c>effective</c></NS> when they <NS type="TV"><i>grown</i><c>grow</c></NS> up and want to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>have</c></NS> a family<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> they do the same <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>as</c></NS> their parents and <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>have</c></NS> a happy family.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the only month I have holidays in.</p>
<p>I'M <NS type="IV"><i>WRITTING</i><c>WRITING</c></NS> THIS LETTER BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I WENT TO THE THEATRE TO SEE YOUR MUSICAL SHOW.

<p>I am very happy to have the opportunity to do some sports. I'm very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> swimming and surfing. <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>Swiming</i><c>Swimming</c></NS> I won last <NS type="RP"><i>summer</i><c>summer's</c></NS></i><c>I won last summer's swimming</c></NS> competition in the school<NS type="RP"><i>, although</i><c>.

<p>It's wonderful that you are going to <NS type="RV"><i>listen</i><c>attend</c></NS> a pop concert. I'm sure you will <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> enjoy <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. You asked me to tell you about my experience <NS type="FV"><i>to help</i><c>helping</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>concencert</i><c>concert</c></NS> last week.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you, first of all I was very nervous<NS type="MP"><i> you</i><c>. You</c></NS> know <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was my first time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> such <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> event. I was asked to put <NS type="W"><i>in order all the <NS type="FN"><i>chair</i><c>chairs</c></NS></i><c>all the chairs in order</c></NS> for the singer<NS type="RP"><i>, this</i><c>.

After that all the <NS type="FN"><i>singer</i><c>singers</c></NS> arrived and I was in <NS type="S"><i>charche</i><c>charge</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> greeting them and <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>giving</c></NS> them something to drink. You <NS type="MV"><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>immagine</i><c>imagine</c></NS> how <NS type="RJ"><i>existing</i><c>excited</c></NS> I was<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> because I always wanted some <NS type="AGN"><i>photograph</i><c>photographs</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> them and this was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> special moment and I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>realice</i><c>realise</c></NS></i><c>realised</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>didn't bring</i><c>hadn't brought</c></NS> my camera<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I was very sad.</p>
<p>The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> because the owners were <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> hearing from you.</p>
<p>Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing <NS type="RY"><i>fine</i><c>well</c></NS>, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe <NS type="M"><c>what happened</c></NS> last month!!! I helped Korn <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they <NS type="RV"><i>pleased</i><c>wanted</c></NS>. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even <NS type="AS"><i>took pictures</i><c>had our pictures taken</c></NS> with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all. Please write back. Love, Lolita.</p>
<p>To begin with<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> you say that Danny Brooks will be starring <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the show but instead <NS type="SX"><i>their</i><c>there</c></NS> was a different actor<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which made us very disappointed. Another thing that is <NS type="RV"><i>written</i><c>said</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> is that the <NS type="RN"><i>night</i><c>evening</c></NS> show will start at 7:30 but <NS type="U"><i>instead of that</i></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>their</i><c>there</c></NS> was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minute delay<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> The <NS type="DN"><i>crowded</i><c>crowd</c></NS> got really upset and we were going to leave <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> the first <NS type="S"><i>chanse</i><c>chance</c></NS> we <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>got</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>

<p>I believe <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern <NS type="S"><i>techonology</i><c>technology</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>changed</i><c>has changed</c></NS> everyone<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>especiale</i><c>especially</c></NS> now with <NS type="FN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS> and all the <NS type="S"><i>athers</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>machins</i><c>machines</c></NS>. Personally<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS> modern technology <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>has changed</c></NS> me a lot. First I <NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>want</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>say</i><c>to say</c></NS></i><c>to talk</c></NS> about the <NS type="S"><i>combuter</i><c>computer</c></NS>. Before<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I used <NS type="SX"><i>same</i><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>ather</i><c>other</c></NS> ways to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> information or play or <NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS> with people.

I can spend so many <NS type="SX"><i>ours</i><c>hours</c></NS> because day by day I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>discavered</i><c>discovered</c></NS></i><c>discover</c></NS> new things. <NS type="S"><i>Maby</i><c>Maybe</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not good because you don't have the <NS type="S"><i>oportunite</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to <NS type="S"><i>meed</i><c>meet</c></NS> people and talk <NS type="MP"><i>face <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>to</c></NS> face</i><c>face-to-face</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>Exepted</i><c>Excepted</c></NS></i><c>Apart</c></NS> from computers we have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone, <NS type="UP"><i>T.V</i><c>TV</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i><NS type="S"><i>gymnastick</i><c>gymnastic</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>centers</i><c>centres</c></NS></i><c>gyms</c></NS>. All <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> are <NS type="M"></NS> in my life.</p>
<p>I am writing to express my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the musical show I <NS type="TV"><i>had seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> yesterday, called 'Over The Rainbow'.</p>
<p>Peter got very angry and <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> Pat why <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>had</c></NS> they</i><c>they had</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>say</i><c>said</c></NS> that to him. Pat did not answer <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> him. The next day all the school knew that Peter was gay and even though he didn't mind what <NS type="TV"><i>happened</i><c>had happened</c></NS> he didn't <NS type="FV"><i>talked</i><c>talk</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> Pat <NS type="UY"><i>no</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>more</i><c>again</c></NS> in his life.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> 1st "F" is <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> "<NS type="UP"><i>fast-food</i><c>fast food</c></NS>", something fast and <NS type="R">easy to be spotted</NS>, which is <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> ancient <NS type="R">wearing style</NS>. This is not <NS type="S"><i>nomally</i><c>normally</c></NS> what people wear <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>.</p>
<p>This so-called "Perfect Evening" was <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> disappointing as well as discouraging <NS type="MA"><c>us</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>coming</i><c>going</c></NS> to <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>the</c></NS> Circle Theatre again.</p>
<p>The biggest achievement of modern technology <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>has broken</i><c>broke</c></NS></i><c>came</c></NS> into my house as soon as I <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>reached</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> my studies, <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS> and projects for school. With the Internet, I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>became</c></NS> more <NS type="RJ"><i>socialised</i><c>sociable</c></NS> using the Relay Chat clients, but also <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>developed</c></NS> a kind of boredom, which is known as "Internet Freak Disease"! I use it a lot<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands.</p>
<p>To sum up, my life is <NS type="RV">surrounded by</NS> modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It <NS type="RY"><i>only</i><c>just</c></NS> depends <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> your judgement and the way <NS type="RV"><i>you're</i><c>you plan</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> to use technology.</p>
<p>I received your letter, so I <NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>am writing</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you to give you some <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I finish school <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> June and I go to Great Britain <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August for one month.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>beggining</i><c>beginning</c></NS></i><c>At first</c></NS> they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him.</p>
<p>Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't <NS type="RV"><i>explain</i><c>tell</c></NS> her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend. It could <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>from</c></NS> her.</p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>NOTICE</i><c>NEWS</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>ABOUT</c></NS> MY PRIZE. <NS type="RT"><i>ABOUT</i><c>REGARDING</c></NS> YOUR QUESTIONS I WOULD RESPOND THAT JULY WOULD BE THE MONTH I COULD GO TO THE CAMP, <NS type="U"><i>ALL THIS IS OF</i></NS> BECAUSE MY JOB FINISHES AT THE END OF JUNE. THAT WAY I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE CAMP.</p>
<p><NS type="FV"><i>ANSWERING</i><c>TO ANSWER</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>TO</i></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>YOU'RE</i><c>YOUR</c></NS> NEXT QUESTION, I <NS type="MV"><c>WOULD</c></NS> RATHER STAY <NS type="RT"><i>AT</i><c>IN</c></NS> A LOG CABIN<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> THE THING IS<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I HAVE <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>FOBIA</i><c>PHOBIA</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>TOWARDS</i><c>ABOUT</c></NS> INSECTS AND MY DOCTOR <NS type="S"><i>RECOMENDED</i><c>RECOMMENDED</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>ME</i><c>THAT</c></NS> I SHOULD SLEEP IN <NS type="RJ"><i>A CLOSED</i><c>AN ENCLOSED</c></NS> AREA.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>FOR</i><c>REGARDING</c></NS> THE QUESTION YOU <NS type="RV"><i>MADE</i><c>ASKED</c></NS> ABOUT ACTIVITIES MY ANSWER WOULD BE CLIMBING AND SWIMMING. I CHOOSE <NS type="AGD"><i>THIS</i><c>THESE</c></NS> TWO ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I USED TO <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>PRACTICE</i><c>PRACTISE</c></NS></i><c>DO</c></NS> THEM <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> LONG TIME AGO AND BESIDES I WOULD SAY I HAVE THE SKILLS AND ABILITY TO <NS type="RV"><i>MAKE</i><c>DO</c></NS> THEM.</p>
<p>IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO THAT THEY SHOULD <NS type="UV"><i>GET</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>FOUCOSED</i><c>FOCUSED</c></NS></i><c>FOCUS</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> OUR WRITING AND <NS type="S"><i>CULTURS</i><c>CULTURE</c></NS> LESSONS.

<p>STUDENTS SHOULD BE AWARE <NS type="RT"><i>ABOUT</i><c>OF</c></NS> WHAT'S HAPPENING <NS type="RT"><i>WITH</i><c>IN</c></NS> THEIR LIVES<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>DON'T</i><c>SHOULDN'T</c></NS> THEY?</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because my <NS type="S"><i>hollydays</i><c>holidays</c></NS> are only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>it</i><c>that month</c></NS> and the <NS type="S"><i>wheather</i><c>weather</c></NS> in California is better <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS>. I am that kind of person who <NS type="AGV"><i>enjoy</i><c>enjoys</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>having</c></NS> a wild and simple life, so I prefer to <NS type="RV"><i>be accommodated</i><c>stay</c></NS> in tents.</p>
<p>About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I have a lot of experience <NS type="MV"><c>playing</c></NS>. The second one is sailing, but I am not so good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this sport.</p>
<p>In your last letter <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I <NS type="TV"><i>enjoy</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> it very much<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>.  It</c></NS> was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>responsable</i><c>responsible</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> lights and sound. I told <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>them</c></NS> that I will think about it but I <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> I will accept the job.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>about</i><c>About</c></NS> the things you asked me in your letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would like to go to camp California <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> because that's the month when <NS type="R"><i>I go out from school</i><c>term ends</c></NS> and I have my vacations and I think it would be much easier that month. About my <NS type="S"><i>acommodations</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the camp<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more <NS type="DY"><i><NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS></i><c>comfortably</c></NS>. The activities that I would like to do are <NS type="SX"><i>signing</i><c>singing</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because my friend told me that <NS type="MP"><i>im</i><c>I'm</c></NS> good at it<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> and the other <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> that I would like to do is climbing because I <NS type="SX"><i>thing</i><c>think</c></NS> it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> very exciting although I have never tried climbing<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> because <NS type="W"><i>in my city there are no mountains</i><c>there are no mountains in my city</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I just want to ask you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> something else. How many jeans, Pants, <NS type="AGN"><i>sweater</i><c>sweaters</c></NS> etc... do I have to take? <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> how much money <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>do</c></NS> I need to bring in my pocket?</p>
<p>Dear Kim <NS type="MP"><i>Im</i><c>I'm</c></NS> having a great time here in <NS type="RP"><i>brazil</i><c>Brazil</c></NS>, I have been going out with some friends <NS type="R"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> now I have a girlfriend. <NS type="MP"><i>Shes</i><c>She's</c></NS> very nice and very Pretty too.<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> Well on march 11th there was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> group here in brazil <NS type="L"><i>named</i><c>called</c></NS> "Los Jagoares"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> they sing pop music. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i><NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS></i><c>they are</c></NS> one of my <NS type="SA"><i>favorites</i><c>favourites</c></NS> and as you know I have a cousin that works as <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in <NS type="RP"><i>brazil</i><c>Brazil</c></NS> and when my cousin knew that my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> band was coming he called me and <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> me <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> if I would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and I said<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "<NS type="RP"><i>sureman".</i><c>Sure man."</c></NS> That night I went to the stadium and I met the singer<NS type="MP"><i> his</i><c>. His</c></NS> name is saul Hernañdez and he is very funny<NS type="MP"><i> that</i><c>. That</c></NS> night I had a lot of fun with them and of course I was <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the first <NS type="RN"><i>line</i><c>row</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert. It was the best day of my life. I hope you are having fun and that you are OK. Your friend Henrique.</p>
<p>"Over the <NS type="RP"><i>rainbow</i><c>Rainbow</c></NS>" was supposed to start at seven thirty. We went there on time. We waited <NS type="S"><i>ther</i><c>there</c></NS> for <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it. We really got bored<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> all the other <NS type="S"><i>peaple</i><c>people</c></NS> there.</p>
<p>The party will be organised on Tuesday the 16th of June at three to six pm <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> college <NS type="RP"><i>Canteen</i><c>canteen</c></NS>. We will have food and drink and we will have music because we know that Mr Brown loves music. <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>To</c></NS> the party will come his students, the teachers and the principal</i><c>His students, the teachers and the principal will come to the party</c></NS>. My last question is about <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> present. My fellow students have suggested <NS type="FV"><i>to buy</i><c>buying</c></NS> a CD or a <NS type="RP"><i>Book</i><c>book</c></NS>. We would like <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> to tell us which is the best present for him.</p>
<p>At that moment we saw the bus <NS type="FV"><i>to come</i><c>come</c></NS>, it stopped and one man <NS type="TV"><i>come</i><c>came</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i>sit</i><c>sat</c></NS> near <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> us. I <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>recognise</i><c>recognised</c></NS> him. He was my father. I couldn't <NS type="S"><i>beleive</i><c>believe</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to see</i><c>seen</c></NS> him for five years. I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> that I was dreaming but I wasn't. It was true<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> my father <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>had</c></NS> come <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> his country after five years.</p>
<p>As requested, I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosed</i><c>chosen</c></NS> two activities - sailing and surfing. I am quite experienced <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> surfing - I have participated <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> some competitions - whereas <NS type="M"><c>I am</c></NS> not at all experienced <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> sailing.</p>
<p>I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp. Also, I would like to know if there is going to be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> qualified instructor for activities since I am a <NS type="RN"><i>beginning</i><c>beginner</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> sailing as mentioned before.</p>
<p>Because you are the manager <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> the theatre, you have to know<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the problems which it has.</p>
<p><NS type="SX"><i>Eve</i><c>Every</c></NS> summer <NS type="TV"><i>I'm going</i><c>I go</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>with my family abroad</i><c>abroad with my family</c></NS>. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer (<NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>) I can speak <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> my friends<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>as far</i><c>wherever</c></NS> they are.</p>
<p>The leisure activities sound fantastic<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. <NS type="TV"><i>I've joined</i><c>I joined</c></NS> a climbing <NS type="RN"><i>group</i><c>club</c></NS> in my town <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> 2 years <NS type="MY"><c>ago</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> it but I <NS type="RV"><i>wish</i><c>want</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>I'd</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>learn</i><c>to learn</c></NS> a lot.</p>
<p>Why don't <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> include some sports, for example, <NS type="S"><i>voleyball</i><c>volleyball</c></NS>? The team has been training very hard during <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the video.</p>
<p>The <NS type="RN"><i>musical</i><c>music</c></NS> lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> students <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> it also said<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> you could visit <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>your</c></NS> restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.</p>
<p>I would prefer <NS type="RV"><i>living</i><c>staying</c></NS> in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is <NS type="R">more natural</NS>. A log cabin doesn't sound like a <NS type="RN"><i>camp</i><c>camping</c></NS> holiday. It sounds like a <NS type="RP"><i>summer-holiday</i><c>summer holiday</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>beach</i><c>coast</c></NS> of Italy.</p>
<p>From the activities <NS type="M"><c>you've offered</c></NS> I want <NS type="RV"><i>to take</i><c>to do</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Golf and Surfing</i><c>golf and surfing</c></NS>. <NS type="X"><i>Both activities I've never done in my life</i><c>I've never done either in my life</c></NS>, so I am a complete beginner <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> playing <NS type="RP"><i>Golf and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Surfing</i><c>golf and at surfing</c></NS>. But the reason I want to try these two activities <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> their image. Golf <NS type="R"><i>play the</i><c>is played by</c></NS> wealthy people, <NS type="W"><i>the upper class of a town</i><c>a town's upper class</c></NS>, and surfing sounds like freedom.</p>
<p>Dear Sir: I am writing <NS type="W"><i>to you this letter</i><c>this letter to you</c></NS> because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>became</c></NS> very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It <NS type="TV"><i>supposed</i><c>was supposed</c></NS> to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a £20 ticket because <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the advertisement for the show <NS type="RV"><i>was put</i><c>said</c></NS> that discounts were available for £10 £15, £20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore, <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the advertisement <NS type="RV"><i>was put</i><c>said</c></NS> that the theatre restaurant was <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RN"><i>chief</i><c>chef</c></NS> of the restaurant</i><c>the restaurant chef</c></NS> was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, <NS type="ID"><i>in the other case</i><c>otherwise</c></NS>, I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>I am writing to you <NS type="FV"><i>complaining</i><c>to complain</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the Play you are advertising as the "London's Newest and Best Musical Show" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my whole life. I cannot bear <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when somebody says something and then does just the <NS type="S"><i>opposit</i><c>opposite</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>way</i></NS>.</p>
<p>The last thing I would like to complain <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because, as <NS type="R"><i>it said</i><c>we were told</c></NS>, of "VACATIONS". If <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the advertisements and leaflets <NS type="AGV"><i>says</i><c>say</c></NS> "VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW" there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>not</i><c>no</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>reasons</i><c>reason</c></NS> for <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> being closed. It should be <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> at least until <NS type="R"><i>all people</i><c>everyone</c></NS> gets out of the place. It must be our <NS type="S"><i>decission</i><c>decision</c></NS> whether to stay and eat there, or not.</p>
<p>First, we have to admit that technology has really increased <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>access to</i><c>ability</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>communication</i><c>to communicate</c></NS>, <NS type="R"><i><NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>to travel</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>geting</i><c>getting</c></NS></i><c>to get</c></NS> information. You can now know what <NS type="TV"><i>happens</i><c>is happening</c></NS> on the other side of the world<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> at the same time <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the "enter" key <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a computer.</p>
<p>Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can <NS type="RV"><i>involve</i><c>get involved</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>during</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>camping</i><c>camp</c></NS>. I would like to choose painting and photography which are my <NS type="IJ"><i>favourites</i><c>favourite</c></NS> ones. I have recently finished a <NS type="MP"><i>three year</i><c>three-year</c></NS> course <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> painting and I <NS type="TV"><i>always be</i><c>have always been</c></NS> fascinated by <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> photography.</p>
<p><NS type="ID">On the other hand,</NS> I would also like to know <NS type="W"><i>some about</i><c>about some</c></NS> further details like <NS type="S"><i>wether</i><c>whether</c></NS> we need to bring <NS type="W"><i><NS type="R"><i>we</i><c>with</c></NS> us some clothes</i><c>some clothes with us</c></NS> or <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> will be provided <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> us and if we need some money in case we have to <NS type="RV"><i>afford</i><c>buy</c></NS> something.</p>
<p>Although I found the <NS type="RP"><i>tickets's</i><c>ticket's</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>prize</i><c>price</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>too much</i><c>much too</c></NS> expensive I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> that there would be some discounts available, but there were not. As a <NS type="S"><i>conclution</i><c>conclusion</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed.</p>
<p>One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> could be the final answer sheet <NS type="M"><c>to the</c></NS> exam on the top of his desk. <NS type="R">Suddenly</NS>, when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>into</c></NS> my notebook<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I couldn't believe it<NS type="RA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS></i><c>. This</c></NS> would be the easiest exam I would <NS type="TV"><i>had ever done</i><c>do</c></NS>. As I went out of the office I found <NS type="W"><i>walking down the corridor Pat, my best friend</i><c>Pat, my best friend, walking down the corridor</c></NS>. As she was also <NS type="RV"><i>making</i><c>doing</c></NS> the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she <NS type="RV"><i>hadn't</i><c>mustn't</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to talk</i><c>talk</c></NS> about <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my <NS type="RP"><i>class mates</i><c>classmates</c></NS> were <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the front door of my house asking me if I had the <NS type="RN"><i>solutions</i><c>answers</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the exam day everybody <NS type="S"><i>anwered</i><c>answered</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>correctly to <NS type="RQ"><i>each</i><c>every</c></NS> question</i><c>every question correctly</c></NS>. And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>do</c></NS> basketball and swimming, because in my school I used to <NS type="RV"><i>train</i><c>do</c></NS> those sports a lot. <NS type="M"><i>Even</i><c>I still do so even</c></NS> now <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> center, but not much.</p>
<p>Nowadays most <NS type="U"><i>of the</i></NS> people are <NS type="S"><i>atractted</i><c>attracted</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>to</c></NS> shopping centers, which <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> not always enjoyable. So, I have some opinions <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>about</c></NS> this, which I would like to tell.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think people have to be careful <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> the things that they buy because probably <NS type="M"></NS> are not <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> good quality, <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>which</c></NS> is very <NS type="RJ"><i>annoyed</i><c>annoying</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and <NS type="UV"><i>don't</i><c>not</c></NS> spend it <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> that they don't need<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because by the end of the month they won't have <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> money.</p>
<p>Finally I think the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>product</i><c>products</c></NS> of the shops</i><c>shops' products</c></NS> are <NS type="U"><i>in a</i></NS> good quality and <NS type="DY"><i>reasonable</i><c>reasonably</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>price</i><c>priced</c></NS>, but sometimes the <NS type="W"><i>staff of the shop</i><c>shop's staff</c></NS> is not very friendly <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> you<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="X"><i>think is not</i><c>don't think it's</c></NS> very nice to buy <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> there, with these people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately your advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> it wasn't true!</p>
<p>Firstly, <NS type="TV"><i>it's</i><c>it was</c></NS> written that <NS type="W"><i><NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>be played</i><c>be playing</c></NS></i><c>be performing</c></NS> by Danny Brook</i><c>Danny Brook would be performing in it</c></NS>, but in fact <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>he</c></NS> wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. In addition to this, the <NS type="RN"><i>timetable</i><c>time</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> 19.30<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> wasn't correct. <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>We've lost</i><c>We lost</c></NS></i><c>We wasted</c></NS> our time waiting outside in the cold <NS type="MY"><c>until</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> the doors <NS type="UV"><i>would get</i></NS> opened 45 minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>reduce</i><c>reduction</c></NS></i><c>discount</c></NS>. Again, it wasn't true. When I enquired about the discounts, <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>with</c></NS> the cashier<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> they told me that they didn't have any information about <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Anyway<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> shopping is not always enjoyable as the title <NS type="MV"><c>states</c></NS> because firstly you will get <NS type="RJ"><i>tied</i><c>tired</c></NS> because you have to walk <NS type="CL"><i>out and in</i><c>in and out</c></NS> the shops. Secondly you will get angry <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> bad <NS type="RN"><i>treatment</i><c>manners</c></NS> of the <NS type="RN"><i>sellers</i><c>assistants</c></NS> in the shop. Thirdly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if you're fat you won't find <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> size. <NS type="S"><i>Forthly</i><c>Fourthly</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by <NS type="RP"><i>your self</i><c>yourself</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="R">I could bare it by the time</NS>. Moreover<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but <NS type="SX"><i>he</i><c>the</c></NS> actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> the excuse <NS type="M"><c>that it was</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to be</i><c>being</c></NS> repaired. In fact, the notice had been <NS type="RV"><i>showed</i><c>displayed</c></NS> since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Considering</c></NS> my experience<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was not. I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered. I am looking <NS type="S"><i>foward</i><c>forward</c></NS> to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the prize <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the USA. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the following there is some further information from me.</p>
<p>I would like to answer your questions about this trip. <NS type="R"><i>Before everything</i><c>First of all</c></NS>, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a college. <NS type="R"><i>Such being the case</i><c>Therefore</c></NS>, I need to wait until my college's lessons <NS type="TV"><i>finishes</i><c>have finished</c></NS>. If <NS type="U"><i>it's</i></NS> possible <NS type="U"><i>for you</i></NS> I would prefer to come in July. Before <NS type="R"><i>this time</i><c>now</c></NS>, I <NS type="TV"><i>usually stay</i><c>have usually stayed</c></NS> in log cabins, <NS type="RP"><i>But</i><c>but</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>never had</i><c>have never had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> chance <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>staying</i><c>to stay</c></NS> in a tent. <NS type="ID"><i>According to me</i><c>In my opinion</c></NS>, <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to say</i><c>saying</c></NS></i><c>staying</c></NS> in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> tents is <NS type="S"><i>mor</i><c>more</c></NS> exciting than <NS type="FV"><i>to stay</i><c>staying</c></NS> in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> log cabins. That's why<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I would love <NS type="R"><i>to choose tents for living for 2 weeks</i><c>to live in a tent for 2 weeks</c></NS>!</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On the other hand</i><c>In addition</c></NS>, I've just learnt from your letter that I can <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>do</c></NS> some <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sporting</c></NS> activities during the camp. I'm very happy about this<NS type="UP"><i>. Because</i><c>because</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I spent most of my <NS type="S"><i>scholl</i><c>school</c></NS> life <NS type="MV"><c>playing</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> sports, <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> basketball. But, after <NS type="RV"><i>staring</i><c>starting</c></NS> to work, I <NS type="TV"><i>hadn't</i><c>haven't had</c></NS> any <NS type="RN"><i>chance</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>playing</i><c>to play</c></NS> basketball. Now, you <NS type="TV"><i>gave</i><c>are giving</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> opportunity. As <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> my second <NS type="AGN"><i>activities</i><c>activity</c></NS>, I would like to choose photography, because my education <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>including</i><c>included</c></NS> photography<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I love <NS type="FV"><i>to take</i><c>taking</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> photographs <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> nature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'd like to ask <NS type="W"><i>some questions <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> you</i><c>you some questions</c></NS>. When <NS type="TV"><i>I'm coming</i><c>I come</c></NS>, what <NS type="SX"><i>king</i><c>kind</c></NS> of clothes <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> be able to wear <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> there? And also, <NS type="UA"><i>what</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>do you think how much money</i><c>how much money do you think</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I'll need <NS type="UV"><i>to spend</i></NS> for two weeks<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> I'm looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your answers.</p>
<p>As you know, I was there to help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the <NS type="UJ"><i>good</i></NS> running of the concert and there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> a lot of different things to do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had to make announcements <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>over</c></NS> the loudspeaker for the children who <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> lost.</p>
<p>But the most amazing thing happened later, when<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from <NS type="R"><i>the backside of the stage</i><c>backstage</c></NS>. For a while I thought it was a dream. The <NS type="RN"><i>playing</i><c>music</c></NS> was excellent, the <NS type="RN"><i>public</i><c>audience</c></NS> enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there, <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always <NS type="ID"><i>keep it like a treasure</i><c>treasure it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="U"><i>for entrance</i></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> says that the actor was Danny Brook and <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> he was not. <NS type="W"><i>In the show <NS type="S"><i>apears</i><c>appears</c></NS> a different actor</i><c>A different actor appears in the show</c></NS>, so I was very disappointed.</p>
<p>Then, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> says that the show <NS type="TV"><i>started</i><c>starts</c></NS> at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very <NS type="DJ"><i>unpolited</i><c>impolite</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>side</i><c>part</c></NS>, and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> also, <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>make me lose time</i><c>wasted my time</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Other</i><c>The other</c></NS> thing is that <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>apears</i><c>appears</c></NS> that discounts were available but when I asked <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> it, there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>no one</i><c>none</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The second <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>thing</c></NS> is that it has <NS type="TV"><i>make</i><c>made</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="FJ"><i>easy</i><c>easier</c></NS> my life</i><c>my life easier</c></NS>. <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="UD"><i>The <NS type="S"><i>comunications</i><c>communications</c></NS></i><c>Communications</c></NS></i><c>communication</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>over</c></NS> the world <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute. It <NS type="TV"><i>allowed</i><c>has allowed</c></NS> me to worry about other things <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> life.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the final examination.</p>
<p>First of all, we went to the <NS type="SA"><i><NS type="S"><i>theather</i><c>theater</c></NS></i><c>theatre</c></NS> to pick up our tickets. We were thinking <NS type="M"><c>we would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to get</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>some</i><c>a</c></NS> discount on our tickets, because we had <NS type="UY"><i>already</i></NS> read <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>complete</i><c>full</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>money</i><c>price</c></NS> for the show. We were ready for the show at 19.30. We sat <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>out</i><c>our</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>sits</i><c>seats</c></NS> and waited for the show but it didn't <NS type="RV"><i>come out</i><c>start</c></NS> on time, it started at 20.15 which was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>redicoulus</i><c>ridiculous</c></NS> time. We waited for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Finally, we had a totally <NS type="RJ"><i>unhappy</i><c>miserable</c></NS> night <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> your show. You can't take this bad feeling <NS type="RY"><i>back</i><c>away</c></NS> but you might give us our money back. This would be the first good <NS type="RN"><i>memory</i><c>thing</c></NS> for us <NS type="MV"><c>to come</c></NS> from your show.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the other hand, <NS type="SX"><i>thy</i><c>they</c></NS> use all this too much. For example <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> mobile phone<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>:</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>People</i><c>people</c></NS> talk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> it on the street, in the car<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> almost everywhere. Some of them <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>necessiraly</i><c>necessarily</c></NS></i><c>because they need to</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> some of them not. <NS type="M"><i>Just</i><c>They are just</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wersting</i><c>wasting</c></NS> time on it. They don't even think how they <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>make</c></NS> the communication lines <NS type="UV"><i>are</i></NS> busy<NS type="RP"><i>, how</i><c>. How</c></NS> many people <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> on the phone at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> same time<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> Too many<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Anyway<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> technology is the most important thing <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> our life. It <NS type="S"><i>developes</i><c>develops</c></NS> day by day. The problem is<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>"</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>Do</i><c>do</c></NS> we really use it properly or not?<NS type="UP"><i>"</i></NS></p>
<p><NS type="UT"><i>For those</i><c>Those</c></NS> who need to travel in order to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> their destination safely or have their problems solved <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>via</c></NS> telephone.</p>
<p>Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> a company, and I'll only have two weeks off<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July. I'd love to come earlier, but I <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> can't because this job is very important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me, and I'll need it as <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> work experience<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> for my further studies <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> University.</p>
<p>But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you <NS type="TV"><i>are going</i><c>go</c></NS> with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>all</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they <NS type="RV"><i>are</i><c>do</c></NS> not <NS type="FV"><i>buying</i><c>buy</c></NS> anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I <NS type="TV"><i>spent</i><c>have spent</c></NS> the whole morning doing nothing, except <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> looking at them trying <NS type="MY"><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>diferent</i><c>different</c></NS> clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> annoying.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already <NS type="S"><i>resistered</i><c>registered</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> another summer course which starts <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of July. Sorry about that but I can make that <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> only in July.</p>
<p>A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that <NS type="RN"><i>short shots</i><c>close-ups</c></NS> should be taken <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> each subject.</p>
<p>My name is Paula and I'm one of your <NS type="RJ"><i>latest</i><c>most recent</c></NS> visitors <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> your show "Over the Rainbow'', this is also the reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my letter.</p>
<p>The first disappointment confronted us <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the main entrance<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> there was no discount for our <NS type="FN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS> available. Despite <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> this we <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS></i><c>were</c></NS> still <NS type="UV"><i>been</i></NS> looking forward to the show and Danny Brook.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, please, because that <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> when I am <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> vacation. That is really the only time I have, unfortunately.</p>
<p>About the activities listed <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've <NS type="MV"><c>been</c></NS> in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too. I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade. I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you <NS type="RV"><i>will</i><c>like</c></NS>, in which I also play the guitar.</p>
<p>There was a huge Madonna show in a soccer stadium here in São Paulo. The most amazing thing is that I helped <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> it!</p>
<p>But the <NS type="RJ"><i>unpredicted</i><c>unexpected</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> was that I actually got to meet Maddy, and talk to her for almost one hour! The Material girl's the sweetest person in the world, totally unlike <NS type="MA"><c>what</c></NS> the media says <NS type="M"><c>about her</c></NS>. Mo' told me everything about her new album, "Music", and how the single <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> the same name had slipped <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>onto</c></NS> the Internet in the UP3 format. She sang to me part of the album's second single, "How it feels like for a girl"!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> on Friday almost half of my class knew <NS type="TV"><i>what's</i><c>what was</c></NS> going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I <NS type="TV"><i>would pass</i><c>passed</c></NS> the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I <NS type="TV"><i>hope</i><c>hoped</c></NS> that nobody <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>was</c></NS> watching me. Unfortunately<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The <NS type="S"><i>instractur</i><c>instructor</c></NS> opened the car <NS type="MN"><c>door</c></NS> and asked me to sit <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="MP"><i>drivers</i><c>driver's</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>sit</i><c>seat</c></NS>. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very <NS type="S"><i>ofen</i><c>often</c></NS> crossing the white line on the road. I looked <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the mirror and I saw how my friends were <NS type="S"><i>lauthing</i><c>laughing</c></NS>. It made <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> crazy. I started doing stupid things: <NS type="FV"><i>turn</i><c>turning</c></NS> right instead of left and so on.</p>
<p>I just <NS type="TV"><i>receive</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter with the good news. I am very happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but I can only travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have to work until the end of June.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would like to have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> rather than <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy.</p>
<p>First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the delay and <NS type="RV"><i>excuse</i><c>apologise</c></NS> about it. If there <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>had been</c></NS> someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something.</p>
<p>Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles. The best bakery was <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the other side of the town so there was no danger <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> him <NS type="FV"><i>to see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> Alison and <NS type="FV"><i>reveal</i><c>revealing</c></NS> the party.</p>
<p>He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery. On his way he saw lots of places he could <NS type="TV"><i>buy</i><c>have bought</c></NS> the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>as</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>andy</i><c>handy</c></NS></i><c>handiest</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>for</c></NS> Alison's house<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> he kept on riding.</p>
<p>Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. Yes, 45 minutes<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>!</c></NS> I want to see you in that <NS type="RN"><i>case</i><c>position</c></NS>. What would you do? I felt like a <NS type="DN"><i>dumb</i><c>fool</c></NS>, and all the <NS type="RN"><i>people</i><c>audience</c></NS> felt <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>me</i><c>I did</c></NS>.</p>
<p>And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist. More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>under</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>repairing</i><c>repair</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school, a car stopped <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>beside</c></NS> her and a man said<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "I know who is your <NS type="RN"><i>love</i><c>lover</c></NS>, it's Peter".</p>
<p>Obviously, Pat first <NS type="RV"><i>refused</i><c>denied</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>, but then she accepted that she was wrong, and <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>apologyse</i><c>apologise</c></NS></i><c>apologised</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> Maria<NS type="RP"><i>, after</i><c>. After</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>then</i><c>that</c></NS> Pat never again talked about <NS type="RA"><i>someone</i><c>anyone</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>within</i><c>without</c></NS> his or her permission.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity because we can <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> more about leisure and fashion <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> this city. If you allow us to go we could change the programme in <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="MJ"><c>following</c></NS> way.</p>
<p>If you think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the future you <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>might</c></NS> think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> faster and better machines, advanced technology or <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> better life. All this will happen in the next 50 years, how can we be prepared to receive all these things in our homes?</p>
<p><NS type="RD"><i>A</i><c>My</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>least</i><c>last</c></NS> suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some "salsa" <NS type="FN"><i>band</i><c>bands</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> It would be great to listen and dance <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> "salsa" music.</p>
<p>When it <NS type="RV"><i>goes</i><c>comes</c></NS> to my home, I think I have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> usual duties<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. <NS type="RY"><i>However</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my parents aren't demanding<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>:</c></NS> I have to be home <NS type="W"><i>at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>least</i><c>latest</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>by</c></NS> 11 o'clock</i><c>by 11 o'clock at the latest</c></NS> and tell them where I <NS type="TV"><i>go</i><c>am going</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS>.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING <NS type="UA"><i>YOU</i></NS> WITH REFERENCE <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>TO</c></NS> THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE <NS type="RV"><i>HAVING</i><c>MAKING</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>PRERY</i><c>VERY</c></NS> SOON.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>REPRECENTATION</i><c>REPRESENTATION</c></NS></i><c>BEHALF</c></NS> OF MY GROUP, AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR <NS type="FV"><i>TAKE</i><c>TAKING</c></NS> US ABROAD.</p>
<p>WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD <NS type="RT"><i>FOR</i><c>TO</c></NS> YOUR ANSWER.</p>
<p>I WAS LIVING QUITE <NS type="S"><i>CLOUSE</i><c>CLOSE</c></NS> TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW <NS type="W"><i>VERY WELL THE AREA</i><c>THE AREA VERY WELL</c></NS> BECAUSE ALL <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> THE <NS type="S"><i>COURNER</i><c>CORNER</c></NS> OF MY <NS type="RN"><i>HOUSE</i><c>STREET</c></NS>. BUT THAT DAY, <NS type="RC"><i>LIKE</i><c>AS</c></NS> I WAS KIND OF DRUNK, I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT <NS type="RN"><i>WAY</i><c>ROUTE</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>.</c></NS> SO<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> WHEN I NOTICED IT<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF, BECAUSE WE <NS type="SX"><i>WHERE</i><c>WERE</c></NS> IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO. I TOLD HIM<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> BUT HE JUST <NS type="S"><i>SEID</i><c>SAID</c></NS> SORRY.</p>
<p>HE TOOK ME RIGHT <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>TO</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> FRONT OF MY HOUSE. I <NS type="TV"><i>THANK</i><c>THANKED</c></NS> HIM <NS type="RY"><i>SO</i><c>VERY</c></NS> MUCH, AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED <NS type="UT"><i>TO</i></NS> THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>WRON</i><c>WRONG</c></NS></i><c>BAD</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>HAPPEN</i><c>HAPPENED</c></NS> TO ME.</p>
<p>First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also <NS type="RV"><i>refers</i><c>goes</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> the exhibitions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival that you <NS type="TV"><i>had organized</i><c>organized</c></NS>. Furthermore, it's <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>worthful</i><c>worthwhile</c></NS> experience for people <NS type="M"><c>who want</c></NS> to know <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> other countries' arts.</p>
<p>But I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>suggest</i><c>make</c></NS> some requests <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the festival.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Long</i><c>A long</c></NS> long time ago, there were <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> old man and old woman <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> lived <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> foot of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> mountain.</p>
<p>First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement but when I sat <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> my seat, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>seeing</i><c>to see</c></NS> them<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages.</p>
<p>In addition, when I entered <NS type="UT"><i>into</i></NS> the theatre I couldn't have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount in spite of <NS type="MV"><c>being</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> student and I couldn't use <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> your restaurant either after the show. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. <NS type="TV"><i>It's</i><c>It was</c></NS> nonsense, wasn't it?</p>
<p>I am writing an article about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> fashion of the future <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the international student magazine.</p>
<p>Despite my <NS type="S"><i>appriciation</i><c>appreciation</c></NS> of all kinds of sports and activities, <NS type="TV"><i>I'd choose</i><c>I've chosen</c></NS> my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis. As I was a champion <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to <NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS> my skills. Also I like to play tennis, which is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> beautiful "game" itself and good for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> figure.</p>
<p>"Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not" - my English teacher has asked me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the class discussion about shopping.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I must admit<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores.</p>
<p>I am happy to receive it. Of course I will able to go to Camp California in the U.S.A. However, I <NS type="W"><i>only will able</i><c>will only be able</c></NS> to go to there <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July 2001 because I have a job which is <NS type="DY"><i>extreme</i><c>extremely</c></NS> busy work. Our department, which is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> sales department, have to make good sales <NS type="FN"><i>result</i><c>results</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>befor</i><c>before</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> end of June because of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> financial month. So, if I can choose days, I would like to go to the U.S.A <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July 2001. About <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, I prefer <NS type="FV"><i>stay</i><c>to stay</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> log cabins because I don't like to stay in tents which are <NS type="S"><i>unconfortable</i><c>uncomfortable</c></NS> for me. I am <NS type="W"><i>not also</i><c>also not</c></NS> keen on preparing it.</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Finaly</i><c>Finally</c></NS>, I have some <NS type="AGN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS>. When I join this camp, what kind of clothes should I carry? <NS type="RC"><i>Moreover</i><c>Also</c></NS>, how much money do I <NS type="UV"><i>have to</i></NS> need? Please reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me as soon as possible</p>
<p>Hello Kim. How are you? I am well. I have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> big news. I could enjoy helping at a pop concert <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> last week which is "The Max". As you know, I am <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> big <NS type="SX"><i>fun</i><c>fan</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> "The Max". Can you believe it?</p>
<p>I have got good experience and fantastic <NS type="FN"><i>memory</i><c>memories</c></NS>. At the same time<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I have got a small <NS type="MQ"><c>amount of</c></NS> money<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but it was not important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me. I was so happy.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Hellow</i><c>Hello</c></NS>! <NS type="UP"><i>I'am</i><c>I am</c></NS> very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it. So your advice <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> going to a camp suits me very well.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you about my sports <NS type="S"><i>preferances</i><c>preferences</c></NS>. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>came</c></NS> out from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>candidat</i><c>candidate</c></NS> to</i><c>applying to do a</c></NS> masters <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> sports in water polo. And <NS type="R">only out of that reason</NS>, but also because I like water very much.</p>
<p>As a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>economical</i><c>economics</c></NS> form I think I should tell you about one day in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>time table</i><c>timetable</c></NS> of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have <NS type="RD"><i>such</i><c>these</c></NS> lessons<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> English, <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS>, Economics and <NS type="S"><i>Phisics</i><c>Physics</c></NS>. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them<NS type="RP"><i>. Especially</i><c>, especially</c></NS> English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists.</p>
<p>I am writing to you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>your advertisement for</i></NS> the festival.</p>
<p>I believe <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>plays and films should be more</i><c>should be more plays and films</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>than it was for</i></NS> next year and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> stars and artists should be from <NS type="RT"><i>round</i><c>around</c></NS> the world.</p>
<p>One <NS type="MP"><i>reasonably priced</i><c>reasonably-priced</c></NS> <NS type="R">weeker</NS> ticket for all events was excellent because <NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>alway</i><c>always</c></NS> busy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>at</c></NS> the weekend and people prefer to go any <NS type="RP"><i>week day</i><c>weekday</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In my <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="FN"><i>countries</i><c>country</c></NS></i><c>country's</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>school</i><c>schools</c></NS> we are not allowed to have an argument with <NS type="UP"><i>class-mates</i><c>classmates</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> not allowed to eat <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> class. We can't listen <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> music <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> class <NS type="RY"><i>as well</i><c>either</c></NS>. We <NS type="S"><i>alway</i><c>always</c></NS> have to keep <NS type="W"><i>clean <NS type="RP"><i>every where</i><c>everywhere</c></NS></i><c>everywhere clean</c></NS>, but <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of rules are not very strict I believe.</p>
<p>I am writing to you in reply <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>your</c></NS> letter, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>had</i></NS> let me know I am the winner of the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> your competition.</p>
<p>First of all, I am very happy to <NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the USA. Yet, I could only travel <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because I am a student and so my holidays begin <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July.</p>
<p>To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to <NS type="RV"><i>make come</i><c>bring</c></NS> out the best <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> ourselves.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>On</c></NS> the evening I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>have passed</i><c>have spent</c></NS></i><c>spent</c></NS> in your theatre, I was supposed to see "Over the rainbow" (as you wrote on the <NS type="DN"><i>publicity paper</i><c>flyer</c></NS>).</p>
<p>However, it was <NS type="UY"><i>absolutely</i></NS> not <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> you described!</p>
<p>First, there was a big <NS type="R"><i>late</i><c>delay</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>time</i><c>performance</c></NS>. The show <NS type="TV"><i>begun</i><c>began</c></NS> 45 minutes later than <NS type="RV"><i>supposed</i><c>expected</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I think we have to take <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> consideration our <NS type="S"><i>enviroment</i><c>environment</c></NS></i><c>our environment into consideration</c></NS>: <NS type="UD"><i>The</i></NS> pollution makes <NS type="IJ"><i>more and more the atmosphere warmer</i><c>the atmosphere warmer and warmer</c></NS>. In fact, <NS type="DN"><i>winterseason</i><c>winters</c></NS> will be rare or will maybe even disappear. The ice will <NS type="S"><i>smellt</i><c>melt</c></NS>, the weather will be warmer.</p>
<p>Community: <NS type="RP"><i>Another</i><c>another</c></NS> very important point! <NS type="MD"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>Electronical</i><c>Electronic</c></NS></i><c>The electronic</c></NS> community <NS type="R">takes more and more pace</NS> in our <NS type="UJ"><i>habitual</i></NS> lifestyle. We <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> see<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> objects <NS type="UV"><i>will</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>become</c></NS> smaller. So small that I can <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> imagine, they will be <NS type="TV"><i>introduce</i><c>introduced</c></NS> (maybe like chips) <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> our clothes.</p>
<p>Our feelings will be <NS type="TV"><i>transmit</i><c>transmitted</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>electronical</i><c>electronically</c></NS> through our clothes to other people. I think <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> internet. "<NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Internet on our body".. I'm <NS type="S"><i>shure</i><c>sure</c></NS> that is not impossible!</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Unfortunatly</i><c>Unfortunately</c></NS> I have to suggest a change for the programme <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the "Fashion and Leisure Show" takes place that <NS type="RN"><i>date</i><c>day</c></NS> in London. All of the students - including <NS type="RP"><i>my self</i><c>myself</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> think of this as a great opportunity that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> would be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>pitty</i><c>pity</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>be missed</i><c>miss</c></NS>, especially when students can enter for free.</p>
<p>According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative <NS type="UN"><i>solution</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show.</p>
<p>I'm a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> your college and I <NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>am writing</c></NS> this letter for my class because I'm the class chief.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the hall <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>outside</c></NS> our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>is <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS></i><c>that is</c></NS> possible.</p>
<p>As I see <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> your programme<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the shopping <NS type="MN"><c>trip</c></NS> is at the same time <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>as</c></NS> the London Fashion <NS type="MN"><c>Show</c></NS> so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall without doing <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> shopping.</p>
<p>I'm a student in <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> English class which <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>representative student</i><c>student representative</c></NS> from my class <NS type="M"></NS> to <NS type="DV"><i>thanks</i><c>thank</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>the</c></NS> programme that you've <NS type="RY">already</NS> organised for us. It's really wonderful<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> can't wait until that time.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> 7:30 p.m<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>, it started <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> 8:15 p.m. What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off. On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available.</p>
<p>I was really disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>with</c></NS> your show. I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> discomfort which I suffered. I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days.</p>
<p>All <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show. I think that will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very good <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>event</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> especially the part <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> the Latest Fashions, because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is something which <NS type="AGV"><i>affect</i><c>affects</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people of all ages today.</p>
<p>But also the <NS type="R"><i>rest</i><c>other</c></NS> parts of the show <NS type="AGV"><i>seems</i><c>seem</c></NS> to be very interesting. Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting. I think that young people are affected <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> that in the way they <NS type="TV"><i>dressed</i><c>dress</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="MP"><i>Make up</i><c>Make-up</c></NS> and Hairstyles are also very important<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially For our class, because <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> most <NS type="M"><c>of the</c></NS> students <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our class are girls. The girls are <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RJ"><i>interesting</i><c>interested</c></NS> more</i><c>more interested</c></NS> than boys<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and <NS type="FN"><i>hairstyle</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and they want to know all the latest news about these <NS type="MN"><c>things</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I think that they have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> right because<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> they are also people like <NS type="W"><i>me or like you</i><c>you or like me</c></NS> and they should have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> private life. <NS type="MD"><i>Private</i><c>A private</c></NS> life is very important <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>anyone</i><c>everyone</c></NS>, because your job <NS type="AGV"><i>create</i><c>creates</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> stress and you should rest<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>charge</i><c>recharge</c></NS> your batteries For the next day.</p>
<p>On the other hand<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I believe that Journalists <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> doing their <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>job</c></NS>, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and <NS type="M"><c>they are</c></NS> always<NS type="UP"><i>. Following</i><c> following</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Famous people in order to discover something new <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> their <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Last week I <NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter in <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> you told me that I won first prize. I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> in response <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>during</c></NS> my school holidays, in order not to <NS type="RV"><i>lose</i><c>miss</c></NS> classes.</p>
<p>You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> both of them I am very good</i><c>I am very good at both of them</c></NS>. I did a <NS type="RN"><i>surf</i><c>surfing</c></NS> course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life.</p>
<p>ENGLISH: the classroom is <NS type="DJ"><i>beautifull</i><c>beautiful</c></NS>, and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the same day we do a lot of <NS type="IJ"><i>diferents</i><c>different</c></NS> activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.</p>
<p>So I phoned her and told her the whole story. Last weekend <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Local Festival, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is held every year in our Town, I was walking with my little sister, who is three years old. She started running and got lost. So while I was looking for her I saw the Director of my school, Mr Smythe, stealing money from a small shop. I could not believe my eyes! When Mr Smythe saw me there, he told me: "If you say a word you're going to be in serious trouble."</p>
<p>But Pat could not resist the <NS type="S"><i>temptention</i><c>temptation</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>calling</i><c>to call</c></NS> the police. We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "May I talk to you?". <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I <NS type="TV"><i>faint</i><c>fainted</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The two activities I would like to choose are<NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Photography</i><c>photography</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Surfing</i><c>surfing</c></NS>. <NS type="W"><i>Photography I never <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>took</i><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>pratice</i><c>practice</c></NS> in</i><c>I never really got any practice in photography</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, yes</i><c>. Yes</c></NS> I have <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>taken</c></NS> some holiday pictures but I would like to learn more about this. So I am not very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Photography</i><c>photography</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology.</p>
<p>A good example is the <NS type="S"><i>celular</i><c>cellular</c></NS> phone<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I can contact my family without <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> problem, I can inform my company if I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> an accident <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> my car.</p>
<p>I am writing with reference to the <NS type="MP"><i>three day</i><c>three-day</c></NS> trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting. <NS type="RY"><i>Especially</i><c>In particular</c></NS>, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> sightseeing by bus <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>should</c></NS> be enjoyable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March. We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping. We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>during</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> free time.</p>
<p>I am Carlos Gregore and during my last holiday I stayed in London for a week. <NS type="M"><i>Then</i><c>It was then</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I read the advertisement for the show <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre and I decided to see it.</p>
<p>So I decided to write you this letter to <NS type="R"><i>note that wrong</i><c>complain about the inaccurate</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> and to ask for <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>restitution</i><c>refund</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the price of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> ticket or a part of that. I hope you read this and write <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me to <NS type="MV"><c>let</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> know <NS type="IA"><i>somethings</i><c>something</c></NS> about my money</p>
<p>I think <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern <NS type="S"><i>tecnology</i><c>technology</c></NS> is very important <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> my life. I also think I am lucky, because I live in a period of <NS type="S"><i>tecnologic</i><c>technological</c></NS> boom.</p>
<p>My daily life should be changed by these innovations! <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the present day, for <NS type="S"><i>ecsample</i><c>example</c></NS>, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>large</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>part</i><c>proportion</c></NS> of <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>those</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>have also</i><c>also have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, the new frontier of <NS type="FN"><i>computers</i><c>computer</c></NS> evolution.</p>
<p>If I look back <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the past I <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> find that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer is following the same <NS type="RN"><i>street</i><c>route</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>as</c></NS> television, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>telephon</i><c>telephone</c></NS> and a lot of other things<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that now the <NS type="RJ"><i>biggest</i><c>largest</c></NS> part of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> population have at home.</p>
<p>. I'M AFRAID I CAN ONLY GO <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> JULY BECAUSE DURING THAT <NS type="RN"><i>TIME</i><c>MONTH</c></NS> I WILL HAVE <NS type="MD"><c>MY</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>HOLIDAYS FROM SCHOOL</i><c>SCHOOL HOLIDAYS</c></NS>, SO THAT WILL <NS type="MV"><c>BE</c></NS> FOR ME THE ONLY <NS type="RN"><i>POSSIBILITY</i><c>CHANCE</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>OF</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>TO TAKE</i><c>TAKING</c></NS> 2 WEEKS OFF.</p>
<p>. THE KIND OF <NS type="S"><i>ACCOMODATION</i><c>ACCOMMODATION</c></NS> I PREFER IS <NS type="UT"><i>IN</i></NS> A TENT BECAUSE <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>A</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>SOMMER</i><c>SUMMER</c></NS> CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING <NS type="UP"><i>'OUTSIDE'</i><c>OUTSIDE</c></NS> UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM.</p>
<p>. THERE ARE TWO ACTIVITIES I WOULD LIKE TO <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>PRACTICE</i><c>PRACTISE</c></NS></i><c>DO</c></NS>: BASKETBALL AND PAINTING. <NS type="MP"><i>IM</i><c>I'M</c></NS> QUITE GOOD <NS type="MT"><c>AT</c></NS> PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> WE USED TO HAVE <NS type="CN"><i>TRAININGS</i><c>TRAINING</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>SESSIONS</c></NS> TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES <NS type="R"><i>AT</i><c>A</c></NS> MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER <NS type="AGN"><i>SCHOOLS</i><c>SCHOOL</c></NS>, WHICH WAS GREAT. PAINTING ALWAYS DID <NS type="FV"><i>FASCINATED</i><c>FASCINATE</c></NS> ME, EVEN <NS type="MC"><c>THOUGH</c></NS> I'M NOT SO GOOD <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>AT</c></NS> IT, BUT MY FRIENDS <NS type="UA"><i>THEY</i></NS> SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> THE <NS type="S"><i>TECHNIK</i><c>TECHNIQUE</c></NS> I LIKE THE MOST IS <NS type="SA"><i>WATERCOLORS</i><c>WATERCOLOURS</c></NS>.</p>
<p>THEN CAME THE GUY WHO INSTALLED THE SOUND <NS type="MN"><c>EQUIPMENT</c></NS> (CABLES, BOXES, WIRES, ETC) AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SEEING HIM AT WORK<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> EVERYTHING HAD TO BE <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE RIGHT PLACE, PERFECTLY INSTALLED AND PROTECTED<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> TO AVOID ACCIDENTS.</p>
<p>AT ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK EVERYTHING WAS READY AND THE BAND CAME <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> THERE WERE ALREADY PLENTY OF <NS type="UP"><i>'FANS'</i><c>FANS</c></NS> WAITING FOR THE CONCERT TO BEGIN, WHICH STARTED AT 7 O'CLOCK. I KNOW THE MUSICIANS FROM <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> SCHOOL <NS type="UN"><i>TIME</i></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>THAT'S</i><c>WHICH IS</c></NS> WHY IT WAS EVEN MORE FUN TO HELP AND TO TAKE PART <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THIS EVENT, SPECIALLY BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC THEY PLAY.</p>
<p>My name is Gabriel and I <NS type="TV"><i>represented</i><c>represent</c></NS> our class. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would particularly like to go to the show. As <NS type="DN"><i>representant</i><c>representative</c></NS> of my class may I kindly ask you to <NS type="W"><i>change partially</i><c>partially change</c></NS> your plan <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> our visit <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The</i></NS> Monday 13 March <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="RJ">fine</NS>. The morning <NS type="M"></NS> visiting interesting places in the City and <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon <NS type="M"></NS> make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent.</p>
<p>I knew<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>can't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>swimm</i><c>swim</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>then</i><c>so</c></NS> I realized it might be dangerous for me as well. But <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this particular moment it wasn't important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me. The most important <NS type="FN"><i>things</i><c>thing</c></NS> was a little boy <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> about ten years old, who was in the <NS type="S"><i>watter</i><c>water</c></NS> without <NS type="MD"><c>his</c></NS> parents and couldn't <NS type="S"><i>swimm</i><c>swim</c></NS>. It was <NS type="S"><i>diffucult</i><c>difficult</c></NS> for me because I am afraid of <NS type="S"><i>watter</i><c>water</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Although</i><c>However</c></NS> I went quickly to him and took him <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>hands</i><c>arms</c></NS>. He was <NS type="S"><i>exhaused</i><c>exhausted</c></NS> and couldn't <NS type="DV"><i>breath</i><c>breathe</c></NS>. In the meantime a man told me he <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> a doctor and could help the boy. I was very happy that I managed to save the <NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS> of the boy. Now, when I consider <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> the events<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it's clear <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me that if I got <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> a few minutes later <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> probably <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>would have been</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> late.</p>
<p>Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the great <NS type="S"><i>sucess</i><c>success</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the festival.</p>
<p>As regards the time that I can travel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July. I hope that it <NS type="TV"><i>wouldn't</i><c>won't</c></NS> be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July. I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an <NS type="S"><i>allergie</i><c>allergy</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>to</c></NS> grass.</p>
<p>Finally<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="W"><i>have also</i><c>also have</c></NS> some questions <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you. Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>possibilies</i><c>possibilities</c></NS></i><c>facilities</c></NS> for cooking.</p>
<p>Having finally decided and got what you wanted <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS>, the next torture comes at the <NS type="UP"><i>cash-desk</i><c>cash desk</c></NS>, when you have to pay. You have to wait <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a long queue for more than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> next year's International Arts Festival, <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> in my opinion has been a great idea <NS type="UV"><i>to create</i></NS>.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>spent</i><c>had</c></NS> a good time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I <NS type="DY"><i>personaly</i><c>personally</c></NS> think that <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.</p>
<p>In your letter you <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> your homework <NS type="RP"><i>?Don't</i><c>, don't</c></NS> you?</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> reference to the programme for the English class<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I <NS type="RV"><i>agree with</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS>, I think that the class will like going <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Sightseeing</i><c>sightseeing</c></NS> by bus and in the afternoon going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>River</i><c>river</c></NS> trip to Greenwich<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> Also, they can visit <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Science Museum, and they can <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> shopping<NS type="RP"><i>, on</i><c>. On</c></NS> Wednesday 15 March they <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> going to visit <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> National Art Gallery, really, I think that is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good programme.</p>
<p>The first thing that <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>dissapoint</i><c>disappoint</c></NS></i><c>disappointed</c></NS> me was the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS>. I expected to see Danny Brook because <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the paper that you <NS type="TV"><i>have given</i><c>gave</c></NS> to me it <NS type="TV"><i>wrote</i><c>was written</c></NS> that Danny Brook <NS type="TV"><i>came</i><c>was coming</c></NS> but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>started</c></NS> at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> available but they <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> not available. You wrote <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> "visit our restaurant after the show" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> but the <NS type="S"><i>reastaurant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> was closed because the show started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20:15 and <NS type="S"><i>finissed</i><c>finished</c></NS> at 00.15 and the restaurant was <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> until 00.00. Finally you wrote that <NS type="M"><c>it would be</c></NS> "your perfect evening out" but after all <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> problems how would you expect <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>me</c></NS> to have a perfect evening out<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p>The reality was <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> Marine's parents <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> not her real parents, they found her in their <NS type="MP"><i>houses</i><c>house's</c></NS> garden. They <NS type="TV"><i>try</i><c>tried</c></NS> so many things to find her family<NS type="MP"><i> for</i><c>. For</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS> year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find <NS type="MA"><c>them</c></NS>. In this one year they <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to be her parents. When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and <NS type="SX"><i>sad</i><c>said</c></NS> that he <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> Marine's father and <NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="SX"><i>wont</i><c>want</c></NS></i><c>wanted</c></NS> to take her<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> and he added that he <NS type="TV"><i>leave</i><c>left</c></NS> Marine because her mother <NS type="TV"><i>was dead</i><c>died</c></NS> two days after Marine's birth<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> prison<NS type="MP"><i> he</i><c>. He</c></NS> had nobody that he <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> give <NS type="RP"><i>marry</i><c>Marine</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> so he <NS type="TV"><i>leave</i><c>left</c></NS> her <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> their garden. <NS type="UD"><i>The</i></NS> Marine's real father <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> her back but the other <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>cuples</i><c>couples</c></NS></i><c>couple</c></NS> didn't want to give her <NS type="MY"><c>back</c></NS> because they loved Marine so much. They <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>gave</c></NS> a lot of money to Marine's real father to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>keep</c></NS> her. After that Marine's father <NS type="TV"><i>take</i><c>took</c></NS> the money &amp; left her. The <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>cuples</i><c>couples</c></NS></i><c>couple</c></NS> couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>tell</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>reality</i><c>truth</c></NS> to Marine because they were afraid of losing her.</p>
<p>After I told <NS type="W"><i>the <NS type="RN"><i>reality</i><c>truth</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Pat</i><c>Pat the truth</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> Pat said this <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>to</c></NS> Marine. Marine said to Pat <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> "I <NS type="TV"><i>had <NS type="IV"><i>knowed</i><c>known</c></NS></i><c>knew</c></NS> that because I <NS type="TV"><i>talked</i><c>talk</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> my real father every month but my parents <NS type="AGV"><i>doesn't</i><c>don't</c></NS> know that because I am waiting for them to <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>tell</c></NS> me the <NS type="RN"><i>reality</i><c>truth</c></NS>".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is one of my <NS type="RN"><i>colleges</i><c>colleagues</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> the office. She works with me. We get on very well. She is a single mum. She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very <NS type="RJ"><i>understandable</i><c>understanding</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, I went to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> toilet<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="S"><i>overherd</i><c>overheard</c></NS> two people talking about my son<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I felt <NS type="DJ"><i>pity</i><c>sorry</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> myself and I burst into tears. I quickly got out of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> toilet. I don't remember how I finished work that day.</p>
<p>I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London for a week of "pure holiday"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> thinking <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>have</c></NS> some fun <NS type="RV"><i>coming</i><c>going</c></NS> to see your musical show.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the advertisement it <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>was</c></NS> written that <NS type="W"><i>there would <NS type="FV"><i>have been</i><c>be</c></NS> Danny Brook</i><c>Danny Brook would be there</c></NS> too. (I like him very much and, <NS type="RY"><i>truly</i><c>frankly</c></NS>, I came to the theatre just to see him)</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the end, I asked for <NS type="MD"><c>I</c></NS> money back (and <NS type="S"><i>paiment</i><c>payment</c></NS> for my <NS type="S"><i>orrible</i><c>horrible</c></NS> night): do you think anybody <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> give me <NS type="W"><i>back something</i><c>something back</c></NS>?!</p>
<p>I hope, that in the future, you will understand that it isn't right to write false things <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> an advertisement.</p>
<p>Science and technology characterize our <NS type="S"><i>moder</i><c>modern</c></NS> society. They have <NS type="RV"><i>taken</i><c>made</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> big progress in our <NS type="RP"><i>every day</i><c>everyday</c></NS> life and they <NS type="TV"><i>have always become</i><c>are always becoming</c></NS> more important for us. If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of <NS type="FN"><i>comfort</i><c>comforts</c></NS> (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by <NS type="FN"><i>hands</i><c>hand</c></NS> or by animal <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>labour</c></NS>: I think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> that time life was really <NS type="MY"><c>much</c></NS> harder than now! We have to say that technological <NS type="RN"><i>searches</i><c>advances</c></NS> have <NS type="RV"><i>taken in</i><c>given</c></NS> our society "their good fruits" but, at the same time, <NS type="M"><c>they have</c></NS> negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or "green" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and <NS type="S"><i>noize</i><c>noise</c></NS> are the main problems of our society. I know I'm <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> "daughter of this <NS type="S"><i>techological</i><c>technological</c></NS> world" and <NS type="DY"><i>unluckly</i><c>unluckily</c></NS> I think I <NS type="S"><i>could'n</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>stay</i><c>live</c></NS> without it: it's rather strange that today there's <NS type="RY"><i>already</i><c>still</c></NS> somebody without <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> phone, dishwasher, TV... But, sometimes I ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological <NS type="RN"><i>discoveries</i><c>innovations</c></NS> and industries was more authentic than <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> our one.</p>
<p>As I'm an <NS type="RN"><i>artist</i><c>art</c></NS> student <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a particular College, I <NS type="W"><i>only can</i><c>can only</c></NS> go to <NS type="UD"><i>your</i></NS> Camp California in July, because in <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month I <NS type="X"><i>got no</i><c>haven't got</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>class</i><c>classes</c></NS>, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>for</c></NS> my <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, because it's safer and cleaner than <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> and I wouldn't share it <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> anyone.</p>
<p>Painting and Photography are <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>activities good for me</i><c>good activities for me</c></NS>. They <NS type="RV"><i>fit to</i><c>suit</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>myself</i><c>me</c></NS> because my art work develops <NS type="UA"><i>itself</i></NS> in these areas. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>Through</c></NS> Painting I talk about human beings in this world, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> big canvases; and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>through</c></NS> Photography, <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> Collages, I talk about anger and <NS type="DN"><i>guilty</i><c>guilt</c></NS> in the <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="FN"><i>families'</i><c>family's</c></NS></i><c>family</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>lines</i><c>line</c></NS>. So <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Camp California I would like to keep <NS type="UA"><i>me</i></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>on touching to</i><c>in touch with</c></NS> these areas.</p>
<p>I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>To</c></NS> summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>so I do</c></NS> not forget my artistic life.</p>
<p>There is joy in shopping when it is <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>done</c></NS> by ourselves <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> ourselves. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>That</c></NS> means buying whatever we like, <NS type="UY"><i>just</i></NS> like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our <NS type="FN"><i>relationship</i><c>relationships</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> people, <NS type="R"><i>in the</i><c>at</c></NS> work or in the family. So we have <NS type="RJ"><i>enjoyable</i><c>fun</c></NS> when we buy what we like <NS type="R"><i>following</i><c>according to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> people's views.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sickness in ourselves <NS type="MC"><c>or</c></NS> our relatives <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>makes</c></NS> us <NS type="RJ"><i>unhappy</i><c>reluctant</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>buy</i><c>shop</c></NS>. It is an obligation <NS type="FV"><i>shopping</i><c>to shop</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> medicines, clothes <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> winter, <NS type="MP"><i>doctor</i><c>doctor's</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>visites</i><c>visits</c></NS>, and so forth. A death in the family is <NS type="W"><i>not also</i><c>also not</c></NS> an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is <NS type="R">the highest point of the sickness</NS>. Buying coffins and <NS type="RN"><i>graveyards</i><c>graveyard plots</c></NS> to bury <NS type="S"><i>relatieves</i><c>relatives</c></NS> is not as enjoyable as buying clothes.</p>
<p>In <NS type="DN"><i>summarizing</i><c>summary</c></NS> shopping can be enjoyable or not depending <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> our <NS type="W"><i>healthy state</i><c>state of health</c></NS>. <NS type="FV"><i>Giving</i><c>To give</c></NS> examples: <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves; <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> we are sick, or our relatives <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS>, we buy medicines <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> we <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation.</p>
<p>Danny Brook is my <NS type="S"><i>favorit</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor &amp; to see him was my dream <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>since</c></NS> my childhood! It was a <NS type="S"><i>suprise</i><c>surprise</c></NS> when we were told there <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be another actor. Also<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we expected to get a <NS type="AGN"><i>discounts</i><c>discount</c></NS> as <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> students, but international students cards are not <NS type="RJ"><i>available</i><c>valid</c></NS> in your <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> (that is very strange - even your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> has <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>postpone</i><c>postponed</c></NS></i><c>delayed</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> 45 minutes! <NS type="RP"><i>so</i><c>So</c></NS> we were late <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> our supper in the hotel and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre restaurant was also closed without any <NS type="S"><i>risons</i><c>reasons</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>given</c></NS>.</p>
<p>And I think that I made <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> right choice <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> profession - it is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> perfect combination: <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very <NS type="S"><i>progressiv</i><c>progressive</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>form</c></NS> of <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> modern technology, and the most important thing - it is <NS type="DY"><i>extremly</i><c>extremely</c></NS> interesting <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>Accomodation</i><c>Accommodation</c></NS></i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS>, I would prefer the tents, because it is something different <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> you don't <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I <NS type="S"><i>recentely</i><c>recently</c></NS> had a week's holiday in London, and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> during my stay, I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre to see "Over the Rainbow" because I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> seen an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> this show and I was really <NS type="S"><i>interrested</i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> it for many reasons, one of <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> reasons <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is that I love the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Danny Brook. And I would like <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>to know</c></NS> that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw.</p>
<p><NS type="DD"><i>Mine</i><c>my</c></NS> name is John and I <NS type="TV"><i>have been</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the latest International Arts Festival. The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event.</p>
<p>First, I would like to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be <NS type="RJ"><i>profitable</i><c>useful</c></NS> for next year's <NS type="RP"><i>Festival</i><c>festival</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>would</c></NS> be a position related <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> our <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>carreer</i><c>career</c></NS></i><c>degree</c></NS>. Next year I expect <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>finishing</i><c>to finish</c></NS> my studies in LAW. And by that time I will <NS type="W"><i>have already</i><c>already have</c></NS> some experience, so that I will <NS type="W"><i>more easily <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> able to apply</i><c>be able to apply more easily</c></NS> for a really good job.</p>
<p>So, <NS type="RP"><i>Why</i><c>why</c></NS> don't we think more about the future, instead of being upset <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> how to get some money to <NS type="RV"><i>spend</i><c>pay for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> next party?</p>
<p>In the advertisement, it <NS type="AGV"><i>state</i><c>states</c></NS> that the actor <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE. As a result I asked my <NS type="S"><i>acquintance</i><c>acquaintance</c></NS> to come with me to the show. As soon as the show started<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY.</p>
<p>The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> had <NS type="RV"><i>planned</i><c>thought up</c></NS> the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. <NS type="RY"><i>As a result</i><c>However,</c></NS> the only way to get into the building was at the top of the <NS type="RN"><i>build</i><c>building</c></NS>. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>through</c></NS> the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond<NS type="RP"><i>. He</i><c>, he</c></NS> ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him. By the time he got out of the building, the cops <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="SX"><i>ever</i><c>every</c></NS> where</i><c>everywhere</c></NS> but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his <NS type="S"><i>unpredicatable</i><c>unpredictable</c></NS> mind. He ran into the old <NS type="RN"><i>build</i><c>building</c></NS>, and <NS type="TV"><i>hidden</i><c>hid</c></NS> a diamond in there. Unfortunately<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the building was a police station.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>To</i><c>For</c></NS> the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager:</p>
<p>We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> each other.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the name of all the students who will go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="UP"><i>London's</i><c>London</c></NS> trip.</p>
<p>We hope you consider our request which would be <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>much</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>appreciate</i><c>appreciated</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>by</c></NS> the class.</p>
<p>I know that everyone is excited about what happened <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> far.</p>
<p>It was <NS type="TV"><i>writing</i><c>written</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>star</c></NS> with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>starred</c></NS>. That disappointed <NS type="UQ"><i>both</i></NS> me and the people who just went to see him.</p>
<p>And <NS type="MT"><c>regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Times</i><c>times</c></NS></i><c>time</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> the show <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was meant</c></NS> to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> was said <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to be</i><c>would be</c></NS> discounts <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS> but I <NS type="RV"><i>saw</i><c>had</c></NS> nothing like this. All <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people there <NS type="RV"><i>gave</i><c>paid</c></NS> the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day.</p>
<p>It all started two years ago. Rod was a happy man at that <NS type="AGN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS>. One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange <NS type="FN"><i>man</i><c>men</c></NS>, who he ran after and <NS type="W"><i><NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> caught one of whom</i><c>one of whom he caught</c></NS>. Just then, the strange man took out his gun. Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself <NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS><NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> his own gun. Nobody saw <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> nobody heard what had happened.</p>
<p>To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>think</i><c>thinking</c></NS> I did well, I had to play against <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very strong <NS type="RN"><i>competence</i><c>competition</c></NS>. The idea <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> going to California for 2 weeks <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> me feel very excited.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According</i><c>Referring</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter, July is the <NS type="U"><i>period of</i></NS> time <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> suits me best. My job is less demanding in July.</p>
<p>But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when I have to try on <NS type="IJ"><i>differents</i><c>different</c></NS> sizes because the small <NS type="MN"><c>size</c></NS> doesn't fit <NS type="R"><i>on my body</i><c>me</c></NS> because I have <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>put on</c></NS> weight. It is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this moment when really I <NS type="S"><i>realiase</i><c>realise</c></NS> I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling.</p>
<p><NS type="UP"><i>Thank's</i><c>Thanks</c></NS> for <NS type="FV"><i>accept</i><c>accepting</c></NS> me in the competition. I hear that the competition there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> very <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>intense</c></NS>, and <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> Camp California is very famous for <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>its</c></NS> competitions. I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because before <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS> it's impossible for me and <NS type="W"><i>in July it's my birthday</i><c>it's my birthday in July</c></NS> and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full. Another thing is my accommodation<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I prefer to have log cabins because it's <NS type="IJ"><i>easyeast</i><c>easiest</c></NS> for me. I will choose for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> activities tennis and swimming<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I'm good <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> tennis because I <NS type="TV"><i>play</i><c>have played</c></NS> since 1990 and I <NS type="TV"><i>loved</i><c>love</c></NS> it and <NS type="M"><c>I chose</c></NS> swimming because I like to swim and I've been <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> two <NS type="AGN"><i>competition</i><c>competitions</c></NS> and I won both.</p>
<p>For me <NS type="FV"><i>went</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>to shop</i><c>shopping</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> not the best thing I can do. Well I <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>thought</c></NS> the opposite <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>about</c></NS> a year <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>ago</c></NS> but recently I <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>have thought</c></NS> this because I see all the people <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> shopping <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> they don't <NS type="TV"><i>realised</i><c>realise</c></NS> that <NS type="U"><i>they are</i></NS> outside in the real world <NS type="M"><c>there are</c></NS> poor people who need that money <NS type="R"><i>and</i><c>which</c></NS> they are only <NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spending</c></NS> on material things<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>might</c></NS> put <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and <NS type="R"><i>not</i><c>I don't like</c></NS> spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>As to</c></NS> the rest of you who don't understand this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it's <NS type="ID"><i>on your memories</i><c>on your mind</c></NS> to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.</p>
<p>Bye and think <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> this.</p>
<p>Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining <NS type="RN">way</NS>. Some people <NS type="W"><i>when they are <NS type="U"><i>in a</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>sadness</i><c>sad</c></NS>, <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> will go shopping</i><c>will go shopping when they are sad</c></NS> to forget <NS type="RP"><i>every thing</i><c>everything</c></NS> and the fact is that <NS type="RP"><i>every body</i><c>everybody</c></NS> knows how to <NS type="FV"><i>shopping</i><c>shop</c></NS>. If you have <NS type="S"><i>chilldren</i><c>children</c></NS>, you will know <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> very well <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> when you are busy doing something and the <NS type="S"><i>chilldren</i><c>children</c></NS> see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, <NS type="RY"><i>sometime</i><c>sometimes</c></NS> they even cry or shout <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> you and it is really <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>anoy</i><c>annoy</c></NS></i><c>annoying</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS>. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> they are happy <NS type="RY"><i>after</i><c>once</c></NS> they have it. Anyway, <NS type="UY"><i>even</i></NS> in families they <NS type="S"><i>usauly</i><c>usually</c></NS> have this problem that when they <NS type="TV"><i>bought</i><c>buy</c></NS> a new <NS type="R">one</NS>, suddenly they have a problem <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>about</c></NS> where the old one is going to be and that is the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> argument between mother and <NS type="SX"><i>farther</i><c>father</c></NS> or parents and <NS type="S"><i>chilldren</i><c>children</c></NS>. <NS type="RY">Eventually</NS> I like shopping <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> and I <NS type="S"><i>beleive</i><c>believe</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>every body</i><c>everybody</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>like</i><c>likes</c></NS> shopping, but before you buy something think <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>first</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough <NS type="S"><i>meney</i><c>money</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>survive</i><c>to survive</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The reason I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> this letter <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> you is that <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> my <NS type="DN"><i>staying</i><c>stay</c></NS> in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre.</p>
<p>When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> actually didn't appear<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> I noticed <NS type="R"><i>there</i><c>that</c></NS> in the show, <NS type="M"><c>there was</c></NS> someone completely different <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> him so I felt bad.</p>
<p><NS type="MY"><c>When</c></NS> I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> any <NS type="FN"><i>discounts</i><c>discount</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>it</i><c>the one that</c></NS> was written on the folder. After the show I wanted <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>from</c></NS> the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed.</p>
<p>Technology nowadays is something everybody has on <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>his</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>own</i></NS> mind. Every person in the world looks <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> technology <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS> to improve the way they live their own <NS type="AGN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> your house, and when you have to do <NS type="R"><i>a</i><c>some</c></NS> homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school<NS type="RP"><i>, also</i><c>. Also</c></NS> you can search for new subjects on the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Finally, technology is a word that <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how <NS type="UN"><i>technology</i></NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> speed<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it will develop <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the future. Maybe, technology will never stop <NS type="RV"><i>growing</i><c>advancing</c></NS> and our life will never work without computers.</p>
<p>You need more explanations <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>from</c></NS> me to understand my <NS type="FN"><i>motivations</i><c>motivation</c></NS> at the end of this story. In fact, I did this kind of <NS type="AGN"><i>studies</i><c>study</c></NS> because of my interests in programming. The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam <NS type="UV"><i>to succeed</i></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, we got our tickets <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as <NS type="DY"><i>usual</i><c>usually</c></NS> we do in London <NS type="AGN"><i>theatre</i><c>theatres</c></NS>, we could <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> discounts<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>and</c></NS> it's written on your advertisement <NS type="M"></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Surprisily</i><c>Surprisingly</c></NS>, there were no <NS type="S"><i>discounds</i><c>discounts</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we were astonished <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>by</c></NS> the actors<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>whose</i><c>whom</c></NS> we know from <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>musical</i><c>musicals</c></NS>. Why did you not change the <NS type="AGN"><i>name</i><c>names</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> your advertisement?</p>
<p>I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I <NS type="TV"><i>came</i><c>come</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p>As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came &amp; bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said "Congratulations <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the new baby."</p>
<p><NS type="ID">In my opinion,</NS> I would suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> going to the show on <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>wensday</i><c>wednesday</c></NS></i><c>Wednesday</c></NS> morning and <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon, we can choose between free time or <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> National Art Gallery.</p>
<p>They found <NS type="S"><i>hime</i><c>him</c></NS> two months <NS type="RY"><i>after</i><c>later</c></NS> and six months <NS type="RY"><i>after</i><c>later</c></NS> he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a small house in the countryside. Everything was going <NS type="R">on</NS>, when one day, I <NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>am writing</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>this</c></NS> letter to complain about your advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the musical show "over the rainbow", <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> is misleading in a number of <NS type="AGN"><i>way</i><c>ways</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The aim of this report is to suggest which activities <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our daily life at school <NS type="S"><i>shoud</i><c>should</c></NS> be filmed to give the other students <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> idea of what we usually do<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.</p>
<p>Most of the students agree in saying that <NS type="M"><c>there are</c></NS> two <NS type="U"><i>are the</i></NS> main features <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to <NS type="RV"><i>dwell</i><c>concentrate</c></NS> on us working and speaking together<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> without the help of the teacher<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="CE">to show our efforts and sometimes successful and sometimes ridiculous</NS> and also to film some amusing moments we <NS type="TV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> waiting for the teacher.</p>
<p>First of all, there were no <NS type="S"><i>diccounts</i><c>discounts</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>avaible</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>were promised</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>anouncement</i><c>announcement</c></NS></i><c>advertisement</c></NS> so I had to pay the original price <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> wasn't cheap at all.</p>
<p>Then, I was forced to wait <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="S"><i>fourty five</i><c>forty five</c></NS></i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 <NS type="RP"><i>in stead</i><c>instead</c></NS> of 19:30 and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when it finally started, I was really <NS type="S"><i>disapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it <NS type="TV"><i>said</i><c>had said</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>anouncement</i><c>announcement</c></NS></i><c>advertisement</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my decision is that other activities are <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>availiable</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>to take</i></NS> also</i><c>also available</c></NS> in my <NS type="RN"><i>county</i><c>country</c></NS>, except climbing, but I have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> fear of heights so this one is not <NS type="DV"><i>destinated</i><c>destined</c></NS> for people like me.</p>
<p>I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the newspaper.</p>
<p>On the other hand what will happen <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> us in the future? Our <NS type="AGN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> will be managed by robots and they will replace us <NS type="R"><i>in our jobs</i><c>at work</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>During</i><c>Over</c></NS> the centuries man's clothes <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> been changing and even developing in some <NS type="AGN"><i>way</i><c>ways</c></NS>. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS> clothes. I think we can <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>draw</c></NS> a conclusion: <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>over</c></NS> the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am very happy to have won the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the competition, and I am going <NS type="RV"><i>to clear up</i><c>to clarify</c></NS> some details you asked me <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> in your letter.</p>
<p><NS type="U"><i>On the other hand</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>During</i><c>, during</c></NS> my stay <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Camp California, I want to go swimming because I <NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS> this <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> regularly and I often <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>enter</c></NS> competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish <NS type="U"><i>I am</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to sail</i><c>sailing</c></NS>: I have never <NS type="TV"><i>try</i><c>tried</c></NS> it, but it <NS type="R"><i>seems to be</i><c>looks</c></NS> great!</p>
<p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LETTER YOU SENT ME LAST WEEK. I'M VERY PROUD TO BE THE WINNER OF YOUR COMPETITION! I HAVE NEVER BEEN <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>TO</c></NS> SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING <NS type="S"><i>FORWART</i><c>FORWARD</c></NS> TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE. HERE <NS type="AGV"><i>ARE</i><c>IS</c></NS> THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR:</p>
<p>IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY <NS type="DJ"><i>UNREGULAR</i><c>IRREGULAR</c></NS> WORK. <NS type="R"><i>IN JULY WE HAVE GOT</i><c>JULY IS THE</c></NS> LOW SEASON AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO GO <NS type="W"><i>THEN ON <NS type="S"><i>HOLLYDAY</i><c>HOLIDAY</c></NS></i><c>ON HOLIDAY THEN</c></NS>. FURTHER I WOULD PREFER <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>TENTS</i><c>TENT</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>HAVE BEEN</i><c>WAS</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> A <NS type="DJ"><i>SPORT</i><c>SPORTS</c></NS> CAMP LAST YEAR AND IT WAS <NS type="RJ"><i>FUNNY</i><c>FUN</c></NS> TO SLEEP IN TENTS.</p>
<p>WHEN I ARRIVED WE FIRST HAD A MEETING. ALL <NS type="RT"><i>FROM</i><c>OF</c></NS> THE STAFF <NS type="UN"><i>TEAM</i></NS> AND THE ORGANISATION <NS type="S"><i>SPOK</i><c>SPOKE</c></NS> ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE. AFTER THE MEETING <NS type="W"><i>WE <NS type="S"><i>RECIEVED</i><c>RECEIVED</c></NS> ALL</i><c>WE ALL RECEIVED</c></NS> THE SAME CLOTHES. WE WERE A <NS type="S"><i>GROUPE</i><c>GROUP</c></NS>! ONE TEAM! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE <NS type="RJ"><i>OTHER</i><c>DIFFERENT</c></NS> HOBBIES AND <NS type="RN"><i>WORK</i><c>JOBS</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two <NS type="DN"><i>starrings</i><c>stars</c></NS> but, in fact, only <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>one</c></NS> actor <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> performing <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the show.</p>
<p>Secondly, there was a delay <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>with</c></NS> the show<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="TV"><i>supposed</i><c>was supposed</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>started</i><c>start</c></NS> at 19.30 but<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> actually started at 20:15. This really upset me as no notice <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> given before the show.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> money back <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket due to the <NS type="S"><i>disapointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> evening out and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>unreliable</i><c>misleading</c></NS> advertisement you have <NS type="RV">created</NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that we have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and <NS type="S"><i>Laisure</i><c>Leisure</c></NS> Show" and we have found it very interesting. There will <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> a lot of <NS type="R">show for instance</NS> latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles. I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great opportunity, because <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> entrance is free for students. The <NS type="SX"><i>even</i><c>event</c></NS> is planned <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 14th of March between <NS type="ID"><i>10.00 am and 19.00 p.m.</i><c>10.00 and 19.00.</c></NS> If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme. We <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be able to visit the Science Museum on <NS type="UP"><i>Wednesday's</i><c>Wednesday</c></NS> afternoon. We have checked that it is open every day. As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> nice <NS type="RN"><i>prize</i><c>reward</c></NS> for our work during this year.</p>
<p>My dog was very angry. I was <NS type="S"><i>affraid</i><c>afraid</c></NS> that someone was near my house and wanted to get <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> my house.</p>
<p>Suddenly someone broke my window. I had no time to think<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>kept</i><c>grabbed</c></NS> one of the pots and hit him <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> his head. One moment later I called <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> police.</p>
<p>I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice. The only thing which really <NS type="S"><i>disapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> me was a visit <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show.</p>
<p>Since everyone can afford modern technology <NS type="W"><i>the life of everyone</i><c>everyone's life</c></NS> in the more developed countries has changed <NS type="DY"><i>completly</i><c>completely</c></NS>. We can't imagine <NS type="FV"><i>to live</i><c>living</c></NS> without it anymore because we are so dependent <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> my ticket, it <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>occuried</i><c>occurred</c></NS></i><c>happened</c></NS> to be impossible to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> one.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> someone. It was far too <NS type="RJ"><i>heavy</i><c>hard</c></NS> to keep it <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> myself. So I made a mistake and I told her.</p>
<p>I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was <NS type="RD"><i>not</i><c>no</c></NS> discount <NS type="RQ"><i>neither</i><c>either</c></NS> for her <NS type="UY"><i>not</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>or</c></NS> anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.</p>
<p>Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> all her <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the excellent international arts festival we <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>enjoy</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> last November. I <NS type="RV"><i>found</i><c>think</c></NS> it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> be improved in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>following</i><c>future</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>editions</i><c>years</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> the weekend ticket was really good because it gave <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the people the opportunity to <NS type="S"><i>attemp</i><c>attend</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a whole weekend for a cheap price.</p>
<p>Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> changing the film rolls, <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> cleaning the toilets or <NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>doing</c></NS> some other small jobs.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> my job. It will be impossible <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> another <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>choise</i><c>choice</c></NS></i><c>time</c></NS>, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the best month to travel<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons.</p>
<p>In my opinion shopping is not <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful, <NS type="M"><c>there are</c></NS> too many people in the shops, so I prefer <NS type="FV"><i>spend</i><c>to spend</c></NS> my free time <NS type="UV"><i>go</i></NS> swimming or painting and I go shopping <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the days <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>when</c></NS> usually there are not too many people.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>accommodations</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at this camp, I would prefer <NS type="RV"><i>being</i><c>staying</c></NS> in a tent to <NS type="RV"><i>being</i><c>staying</c></NS> in a log cabin. It is more <NS type="L"><i>amusing</i><c>fun</c></NS> and <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="FJ"><i>friendly</i><c>friendlier</c></NS></i><c>more sociable</c></NS>. It will allow me to make friends more quickly.</p>
<p>I'm so happy <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the experience I <NS type="RV"><i>lived</i><c>had</c></NS> last month.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>Firstly</i><c>First</c></NS> I was <NS type="RN"><i>designed</i><c>chosen</c></NS> to sell the tickets. I was <NS type="RY"><i>already</i><c>really</c></NS> happy to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>such a big concert than the Mylene Farmer's concert</i><c>a concert as big as Mylene Farmer's</c></NS>.</p>
<p>But, the principal reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> this letter is to ask for some money back. I think that <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> best for everyone, and <NS type="TV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'd</c></NS> like to give you <NS type="CQ"><i>an</i><c>some</c></NS> advice<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> if somebody <NS type="AGV"><i>pay</i><c>pays</c></NS> you for a ticket, try to give the best you can.</p>
<p>Many years ago, more or less seventy years <NS type="MY"><c>ago</c></NS> a young man<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>exellent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> capacity <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> thinking and <NS type="FV"><i>to invent</i><c>inventing</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>materials</i></NS> things, started building a big thing called <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> "time machine". He worked day and night.</p>
<p>The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really <NS type="MY"><c>more</c></NS> interesting than I expected. My job <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> behind the stage was helping <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> make-up, <NS type="RN"><i>hare</i><c>hair</c></NS> and clothes <NS type="DN">staylist</NS>. It was very hard. The singers often changed <NS type="DD"><i>them</i><c>their</c></NS> clothes and <NS type="DD"><i>them</i><c>their</c></NS> make-up was <NS type="R">easy to be off</NS> because of the sweat. It was different from <NS type="MY"><c>when</c></NS> I did <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous <NS type="AGN"><i>singer</i><c>singers</c></NS> and spoke to them. <NS type="W"><i>In front of the stage <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> so many people</i><c>So many people were in front of the stage</c></NS> and they couldn't see them very well, but I was <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> very near <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> the stage and I could see them just there.</p>
<p>Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't <NS type="RV"><i>met</i><c>seen</c></NS> each other <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> so long time and I'll tell you more <NS type="AGN"><i>story</i><c>stories</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> this.</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to complain about the show which I saw <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p>For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> freezing morning. We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house. The <NS type="DN"><i>housekeeping work</i><c>housework</c></NS> doesn't take much time thanks to electrical <NS type="CN"><i>equipments</i><c>equipment</c></NS>. And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad. Further, we can get <NS type="CQ"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> information <NS type="R">as you like at a moment</NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. In addition, we can travel <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> anywhere in the world <NS type="RT"><i>within</i><c>in</c></NS> a few days.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage is pollution. <NS type="UT"><i>In these</i><c>These</c></NS> days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern <NS type="RN"><i>life</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS>. Air pollution <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> cars, Soil pollution <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> industrial <NS type="CN"><i>wastes</i><c>waste</c></NS>. The sea is also polluted by oil and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> chemical <NS type="FN"><i>detergent</i><c>detergents</c></NS> which <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> used <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> home. Even food is polluted. All these facts mean that our modern life <NS type="RV"><i>gives</i><c>causes</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>great</c></NS> damage to the earth. All of us must notice this fact. And we should <NS type="DV">keep our attention paid</NS> in order <NS type="FV"><i>save</i><c>to save</c></NS> our precious earth.</p>
<p>Your advert promised me <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> "Perfect evening out", but it was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> terrible evening <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me. So I want you to give me a refund.</p>
<p>I write this letter to <NS type="FV"><i>informed</i><c>inform</c></NS> you about the bad experience I had last week <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> one of the shows your are <NS type="RV"><i>presenting</i><c>putting on</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the sheet I <NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS>, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the <NS type="AGN"><i>actor</i><c>actors</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="UN"><i>thing</i></NS> that</i><c>. That</c></NS> is not true, because <NS type="S"><i>insted</i><c>instead</c></NS> of him, there was another actor, <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>and</c></NS> I don't know <NS type="UV"><i>what's</i><c>what</c></NS> his name is.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter to let you know my decision <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>reply to</c></NS> your letter, which I have received recently. I would like to thank you for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition.</p>
<p>I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I could have <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> holiday <NS type="RY"><i>just</i><c>only</c></NS> in July because I will have been working <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> my <NS type="UJ"><i>previous</i></NS> company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a <NS type="MP"><i>one month</i><c>one-month</c></NS> holiday <NS type="UN"><i>period</i></NS> from my company. I would <NS type="UY"><i>rather</i></NS> prefer to stay in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent than <NS type="FV"><i>to stay</i><c>stay</c></NS> in the log cabin because <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent is more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I might say that I am really good at swimming and <NS type="S"><i>sailling</i><c>sailing</c></NS> because I have been <NS type="RV"><i>joining</i><c>doing</c></NS> these kinds of activities for five <NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS> and I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> really good training <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>sea-sports</i><c>water sports</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'd never been to any activities <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>to be</i></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>valunteer</i><c>volunteer</c></NS> before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an <NS type="S"><i>adversitement</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> on <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>tv</i><c>TV</c></NS>. It said, "<NS type="RP"><i>be</i><c>Be</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>valunteer</i><c>volunteer</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>at</c></NS> our concert and get a free ticket<NS type="RP"><i>".</i><c>."</c></NS> After that I applied and they accepted my application.</p>
<p>All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him. The party <NS type="SX"><i>in</i><c>is</c></NS> on Tuesday 16 of June. You should come <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> 3 pm <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> college <NS type="RP"><i>Canteen</i><c>canteen</c></NS></i><c>to the college canteen at 3 pm</c></NS>. We have bought some <NS type="S"><i>snaks</i><c>snacks</c></NS> to eat and three students will sing for him, <NS type="RY"><i>also</i><c>too</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Besides this, we have invited all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> other teachers and the Principal of our school. Of course all the class will take <NS type="RN"><i>party</i><c>part</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> this party. <NS type="RY"><i>Furthermore</i><c>However</c></NS>, we don't know what present <NS type="FV"><i>buying</i><c>to buy</c></NS> for him. So we would appreciate <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if you <NS type="MV"><c>could</c></NS> help us with this matter. We have thought <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to buy</i><c>buying</c></NS> a <NS type="RP"><i>cd</i><c>CD</c></NS> or a book. He loves to read books. What do you <NS type="RV"><i>believe</i><c>think</c></NS>? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this.</p>
<p>Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>regarding</c></NS> difficulties <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend.</p>
<p>The way <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> which <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> family comes in contact with the members so easily is love. So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> our problems.</p>
<p>You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite <NS type="S"><i>dificult</i><c>difficult</c></NS> for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a <NS type="S"><i>choise</i><c>choice</c></NS>, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather <NS type="RJ"><i>trained</i><c>experienced</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> climbing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I have done it once a <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS> since I was 17. But <NS type="ID"><i>in the other hand</i><c>on the other hand</c></NS>, I have never <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>been</c></NS> surfing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am a <NS type="DJ"><i>completely</i><c>complete</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>Beginer</i><c>Beginner</c></NS></i><c>beginner</c></NS> but I am <NS type="IV"><i>dieing</i><c>dying</c></NS> to do it.</p>
<p>After that, we should have a morning <NS type="RN"><i>view</i><c>shot</c></NS> of one of the <NS type="IJ"><i>most busiest</i><c>busiest</c></NS> London tube <NS type="AGN"><i>station</i><c>stations</c></NS> in order to show stressed people going in and out, <NS type="R"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Including</i><c>including</c></NS></i><c>among them</c></NS> our protagonist <NS type="RV"><i>going out</i><c>leaving</c></NS> peacefully with a couple of books <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> his hand - then the school's door, and him going in.</p>
<p>It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of <NS type="DN"><i>keeness</i><c>keenness</c></NS> on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed.</p>
<p>I hope to have news <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>from</c></NS> you as soon as possible</p>
<p>Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> strike. On top of everything, the main <NS type="RN"><i>cast</i><c>actor</c></NS>, Danny Brook, did not appear <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the show. The actor who <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>appeared</c></NS> instead of him was terrible.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <NS type="W"><i>clothes <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>in</c></NS> 100 years</i><c>in 100 years clothes</c></NS> will not <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> as fashionable as they are now. We should consider <NS type="R">wearing as in more practical way</NS>.</p>
<p>I have just returned from my holiday in London. During my stay I went to see a musical show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle Theatre and I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very disappointing evening.</p>
<p>One day he invited us <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> his party. I was very happy and nervous. Everything was great. But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me. Everybody started to <NS type="S"><i>laught</i><c>laugh</c></NS> at me. I was angry and I <NS type="TV"><i>run</i><c>ran</c></NS> away to the forest.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to tell you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I'm really disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> for the musical show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle Theatre. First of all, I was really looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>which</c></NS> disappointed me very much. Also, the show didn't start <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> time, it started half an hour <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS>. And you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> written in your advert<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that there would be discounts available, <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>possible</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> evening. After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN">painting-works</NS> inside the restaurant. Finally we <NS type="X"><i>had no</i><c>did not have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> perfect evening at all! And <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> of these <NS type="DN"><i>circumstands</i><c>circumstances</c></NS>, I would like to have a part of my money back.</p>
<p>I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>answer</i><c>reply</c></NS>!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I knew that he's <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very talkative person, but it was <NS type="S"><i>nessesery</i><c>necessary</c></NS> because I wanted him to be the main <NS type="RN"><i>director</i><c>organiser</c></NS> of that birthday party for <NS type="R">tenes</NS>. It started a week before that day. Pat found <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> great place for the party called "Blue Box". I made <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>beautifull</i><c>beautiful</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>invite</i><c>invitation</c></NS></i><c>invitations</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>cards</i></NS> for <NS type="AGQ"><i>every</i><c>all of</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>Agatha</i><c>Agatha's</c></NS> friends with a <NS type="RN"><i>sign</i><c>note</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> "Do not tell Agatha about <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, this</i><c>. This</c></NS> is a <NS type="S"><i>suprise</i><c>surprise</c></NS> party for her<NS type="RP"><i>, please</i><c>. Please</c></NS> keep the secret!" Pat arranged <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> perfect <NS type="FN"><i>decoration</i><c>decorations</c></NS> with <NS type="S"><i>ballons</i><c>balloons</c></NS> and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was <NS type="RP"><i>breath taking</i><c>breathtaking</c></NS>. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who <NS type="RV"><i>should come</i><c>was expected</c></NS> at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so <NS type="S"><i>exaiting</i><c>exciting</c></NS>!!! We <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>turned</c></NS> off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard "What the hell is going on?!!" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR! She was so touched that we started to cry. <NS type="S"><i>Enyway</i><c>Anyway</c></NS> the disco was great, <NS type="R">music also</NS>. We had fun <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>until</c></NS> 5 o'clock! Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>receive</c></NS>!</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm worried <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently <NS type="RV"><i>achieved</i><c>got</c></NS> a new job and I started working just three months ago. For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to <NS type="TV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>period</i><c>time</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> my holidays.</p>
<p>Consequently I hope that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>for</c></NS> suspends its activities. As far as I am concerned, I would prefer <NS type="R"><i>an <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS></i><c>to stay</c></NS> in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a <NS type="SX"><i>tend</i><c>tent</c></NS> as well.</p>
<p>In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. <NS type="DY"><i>Actualy</i><c>Actually</c></NS> most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant <NS type="RN"><i>situation</i><c>occasion</c></NS>. In fact, the shopping you do for <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> daily needs is seldom <NS type="S"><i>enjouble</i><c>enjoyable</c></NS>, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and <NS type="S"><i>morover</i><c>moreover</c></NS> you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need <NS type="R"><i>it</i><c>to</c></NS>, shopping can be a very nice activity.</p>
<p><NS type="TV"><i>I've <NS type="RV"><i>seen</i><c>attended</c></NS></i><c>I attended</c></NS> your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> it. I must say that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> International Arts Festival is really <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great idea. And your last festival was very <NS type="S"><i>intresting</i><c>interesting</c></NS> too.</p>
<p>I think that one reasonably-priced weekend <NS type="MN"><c>ticket</c></NS> for all events is <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>exellent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> idea because it isn't so <NS type="RP"><i>Expensive</i><c>expensive</c></NS> as buying <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> ticket <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>making</i><c>holding</c></NS> your festivals.</p>
<p>I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my <NS type="S"><i>favourate</i><c>favourite</c></NS>, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show, you said it would begin at 19.30<NS type="RP"><i>, actually</i><c>. Actually</c></NS> it <NS type="AS"><i>was 45 minutes delay</i><c>was delayed 45 minutes</c></NS>. The discounts <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> tickets that you mentioned <NS type="RV"><i>were</i><c>did</c></NS> not exist. It <NS type="TV"><i>could make</i><c>made</c></NS> things worse that <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> lack of customers, was <NS type="IV"><i>canceled</i><c>cancelled</c></NS>. <NS type="RY"><i>However</i><c>Really</c></NS>, what a <NS type="RP"><i>let down</i><c>letdown</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I am really looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>taking</c></NS> part <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> Camp California.</p>
<p>First of all, <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>in</c></NS> your letter you asked me my <NS type="IV"><i>prefered</i><c>preferred</c></NS> travel dates. If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>be</c></NS> on <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> holiday in July.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> your letter, <NS type="CE">you are going to provid me one of tents and log cabins with accommodation</NS> at Camp California. I would like to be in tents because I <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> find <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert. I'll tell you <NS type="W"><i>my experience about</i><c>about my experience</c></NS> helping <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the pop concert.</p>
<p>However, there was something good <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me. I saw a lot of singers and entertainers. I didn't need to pay <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>enterence</i><c>entrance</c></NS> fee because I was working there.</p>
<p>I'll tell you more <NS type="M"><c>about the</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> next letter.</p>
<p>I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> which my family can eat together. For me, it's very <NS type="DJ"><i>stressfull</i><c>stressful</c></NS> and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like <NS type="RV">cheat</NS> with my <NS type="RP"><i>class mates</i><c>classmates</c></NS> after our lessons.</p>
<p>I am very happy that I won this competition. I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday. My holidays will finish <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of September and <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> will be good to travel during this <NS type="RN"><i>time</i><c>period</c></NS>. (August-September).</p>
<p>For the time that I will spend there I would like to <NS type="FV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> more <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>than</c></NS> two activities but I know <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not possible so I <NS type="FV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> swimming and singing. I <NS type="DY"><i>usualy</i><c>usually</c></NS> sing in my spare time and my friends love <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when I sing and <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>regarding</c></NS> swimming I was champion last year in my city. So, I am quite good.</p>
<p>This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> our daily life at school.</p>
<p>- <NS type="FV"><i>ask</i><c>asking</c></NS> for money <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>from</c></NS> your parents (mum is better)<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is the most traditional way but also the safest one</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to start my <NS type="RN"><i>journey</i><c>trip</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the second week of July because I will have a <NS type="DJ"><i>3 weeks</i><c>3-week</c></NS> holiday in July. I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months.</p>
<p>I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first <NS type="S"><i>entred</i><c>entered</c></NS> the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the right place. It was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> tiring work because I had to run from place to place <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>hanging</i><c>to hang</c></NS> the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert <NS type="TV"><i>was started</i><c>started</c></NS>. There were many people at the show and I was sitting <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> a good seat to watch the concert.</p>
<p>I had a really good time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is?</p>
<p>I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> time. Although<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the accommodation isn't so important for me<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed.</p>
<p>I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>as my</c></NS> activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> both activities.</p>
<p>The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="CE">,,customer treat with order"</NS>.</p>
<p>Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>!</c></NS> He wanted everything <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> his eyes saw. All the stuff for children <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the same level as <NS type="U"><i>they have</i></NS> their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and <NS type="DJ"><i>unsatisfy</i><c>unsatisfied</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>with</c></NS> the store.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>First</c></NS>, all the students and I would <NS type="RV"><i>thank</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>to thank</c></NS> you for this great idea of a trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> three days. The programme is very <NS type="S"><i>exating</i><c>exciting</c></NS> and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich.</p>
<p>So, <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>one</c></NS> day I decided to <NS type="RV"><i>steal</i><c>rob</c></NS> the bank. <NS type="RT"><i>During</i><c>For</c></NS> weeks, I had prepared my <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>plan</c></NS>, trying not to forget <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> important. Everything was ready and <NS type="FA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> too. So I knew that the day after would be the <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>right</c></NS> one.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>get up</i><c>got up</c></NS> very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had <NS type="RV"><i>founded</i><c>found</c></NS> a little window at the back of the building, so I entered <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>in</c></NS> this way and by chance I just arrived in the <NS type="DN"><i><NS type="UP"><i><NS type="S"><i>monney</i><c>money</c></NS>'s</i><c>money</c></NS> room</i><c>vault</c></NS>. I <NS type="X"><i>hadn't never</i><c>hadn't ever</c></NS> seen so much money. I took it, <NS type="CE">the most of possible</NS> and went out <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> the same way. I ran to my house and went back <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> my bed <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>sleep</i><c>to sleep</c></NS> a little bit.</p>
<p>My <NS type="DN"><i>live record</i><c>personal best</c></NS> is 27.66 for <NS type="S"><i>fivety</i><c>fifty</c></NS> meters. I would like to ask you about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> weather <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>California's</i><c>California</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>Julay</i><c>July</c></NS>. What kind of clothes <NS type="W"><i>I should</i><c>should I</c></NS> bring with me<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> Are there any <NS type="S"><i>discoteks</i><c>discotheques</c></NS> or something<NS type="MP"><c>?</c></NS> I would like to know if my wife can come with me, <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>withou't</i><c>without</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>she</i><c>her</c></NS> I can't be there.</p>
<p>However, all my expectations failed to <NS type="RV"><i>become</i><c>come</c></NS> true. First of all, I found that no discounts <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> tickets were available<NS type="UP"><i>. Although</i><c> although</c></NS> you mentioned <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the <NS type="DN"><i>starting</i><c>start</c></NS> they announced that Danny Brook <NS type="S"><i>woud</i><c>would</c></NS> not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor. After the show I was not <NS type="S"><i>surpised</i><c>surprised</c></NS> at all to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration.</p>
<p>Among the greatest inventions of man I <NS type="TV"><i>came</i><c>come</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accross</i><c>across</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>dayly</i><c>daily</c></NS> are <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> day I may contact any person <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> any part of the world over <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - <NS type="FN"><i>thousand</i><c>thousands</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>kilometres'</i><c>kilometres</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>away</c></NS> from me. <NS type="MD"><i>Computer</i><c>The computer</c></NS>, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> access to <NS type="RJ">huge</NS> <NS type="S"><i>informatonal</i><c>informational</c></NS> sources through the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. <NS type="MD"><i>Automobile</i><c>The automobile</c></NS> saves <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> time when I'm travelling.</p>
<p>We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> cleaning.</p>
<p>Nowadays the aim <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves. People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes.</p>
<p>The things we wear may not seem <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>if</i></NS> 'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now. I <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> they will wear very <NS type="S"><i>diffrent</i><c>different</c></NS> things.</p>
<p>The only time available for me to travel is July<NS type="RP"><i>, any time</i><c>. Any time</c></NS> during the month suits me. I need to insist <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Finally I'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life. Can you believe that I was helping <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the last Britney <NS type="UP"><i>Spears's</i><c>Spears</c></NS> Concert?</p>
<p>She was so kind <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> all of us<NS type="RP"><i>, of course</i><c>. Of course</c></NS> I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I can't wait to show it <NS type="M"><c>to you</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I received your letter last week and I would like to thank you very much. I was really surprised and happy to hear that I <NS type="TV"><i>won</i><c>had won</c></NS> the first prize<NS type="MP"><c>. </c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> your letter you ask me some questions about my <NS type="RN"><i>wishes</i><c>preferences</c></NS>:</p>
<p>The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> to prepare this report I visited <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> many occasions the classrooms</i><c>the classrooms on many occasions</c></NS> and talked to the students and teachers.</p>
<p>To sum up, I would suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to film</i><c>filming</c></NS> our library<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because it is a pleasant place that students really like<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and the English <NS type="RN"><i>course</i><c>lesson</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which will help foreign students <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> their future <NS type="RN"><i>choice</i><c>decisions</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>is</c></NS> a very long time since I was in Year 7. I told Pat that my father and mother were going to <NS type="S"><i>seperate</i><c>separate</c></NS>. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my <NS type="FN"><i>feeling</i><c>feelings</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>May be</i><c>Maybe</c></NS> it was <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> wrong decision to tell her<NS type="RP"><i>, she</i><c>. She</c></NS> began to <NS type="RV"><i>spread</i><c>share</c></NS> that <NS type="S"><i>secrect</i><c>secret</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> everybody<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> including the teachers. They tried to contact <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what <NS type="TV"><i>happened</i><c>had happened</c></NS>. All my friends were trying to <NS type="FV"><i>kept</i><c>keep</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>their</c></NS> distance <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>from</c></NS> me. That was all because of Pat.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the competition<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> which I need more information.</p>
<p>To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to <NS type="S"><i>travell</i><c>travel</c></NS>. Well, I would <NS type="W"><i>be only</i><c>only be</c></NS> available in July, because at that time I would be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> winter holidays. Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent <NS type="RT"><i>than</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>sleeping</c></NS> in a <NS type="SX"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabin because it is easier to clean.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>As</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accommnodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> because I think it is <NS type="IJ"><i>safier</i><c>safer</c></NS> than <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> a tent.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In that occasion</i><c>On that occasion</c></NS> I hadn't the opportunity <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>giving</i><c>to give</c></NS> my opinion <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>on</c></NS> this task.</p>
<p>Manager<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="S"><i>spect</i><c>expect</c></NS> that you <NS type="TV"><i>considered</i><c>have considered</c></NS> my bad experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it was a very bad evening.</p>
<p>Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate. The class had organized a secret party for our friend<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> Nick <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> was leaving the school <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> 2 more weeks. <NS type="MA"><i>All</i><c>It all</c></NS> started when Pat, <NS type="W"><i>the best friend of Nick</i><c>Nick's best friend</c></NS>, wanted to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>have</c></NS> the party <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> his house<NS type="RP"><i>, most</i><c>. Most</c></NS> of the class <NS type="TV"><i>disagree</i><c>disagreed</c></NS> with that because the <NS type="W"><i>house of Pat</i><c>Pat's house</c></NS> is <NS type="DY"><i>extremly</i><c>extremely</c></NS> little, they started to say <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> him that his house was like a box. Pat got very <NS type="S"><i>angree</i><c>angry</c></NS> and sad. Pat<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> affected <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> this situation<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> told Nick all <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the situation and the <NS type="W"><i>secret of the class</i><c>class secret</c></NS>. <NS type="ID"><i>At the beginning</i><c>At first</c></NS> Nick got <NS type="S"><i>angree</i><c>angry</c></NS> but then he <NS type="TV"><i>forgive</i><c>forgave</c></NS> him because they were <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> and each of <NS type="RA"><i>one</i><c>them</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> trust <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the other. Nick told the situation to the class and <NS type="S"><i>ofered</i><c>offered</c></NS> his house <NS type="R"><i>to do</i><c>for</c></NS> the party, because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was very big, with large gardens and a big <NS type="S"><i>swimingpool</i><c>swimming pool</c></NS>. The day of the party <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everyone</c></NS> had fun<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially Pat <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>at the <NS type="S"><i>beggining</i><c>beginning</c></NS></i><c>to start with</c></NS> was sad.</p>
<p>Firstly, I can only travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>play</c></NS> Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some <NS type="S"><i>excersise</i><c>exercise</c></NS> while I am on vacation. I also chose <NS type="S"><i>Fotography</i><c>photography</c></NS> because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have <NS type="RV"><i>practised</i><c>done</c></NS> them all my life.</p>
<p>It was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great idea <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>doing</i><c>to do</c></NS> something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some <NS type="IN"><i>concerts hall</i><c>concert halls</c></NS> were too small for all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> who <NS type="RV"><i>took <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> part <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS></i><c>attended</c></NS> that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>a great idea was</i><c>was a great idea</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>that it was</i><c>to have</c></NS> one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.</p>
<p>I've <NS type="TV"><i>been just receiving</i><c>just received</c></NS> this letter <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> you, so I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you. I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years.</p>
<p>As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'm not a secondary <NS type="UP"><i>school's</i><c>school</c></NS> student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On <NS type="S"><i>Sathurday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS> and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> a lot of <NS type="FN"><i>drawings</i><c>drawing</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>paintings</i><c>painting</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and some other subjects <NS type="DJ"><i>doing</i><c>done</c></NS> by <NS type="FN"><i>hands</i><c>hand</c></NS>. We also learn how to design <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the morning, till <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> class, for example <NS type="RT"><i>next to</i><c>near</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> lake, and there we <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>are paintings</i><c>are painting</c></NS></i><c>paint</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature.</p>
<p>I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see "Over the Rainbow"<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> - the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>-</i></NS>. At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show, <NS type="RY"><i>nevertheless</i><c>however</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it <NS type="RV"><i>has</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>wrong information</i><c>misleading</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot.</p>
<p>When we were <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> his 10th birthday by <NS type="RV"><i>preparing</i><c>arranging</c></NS> a fancy dress party <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the school.</p>
<p>When I found the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is <NS type="L">great</NS> to hold an annual international arts festival in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world<NS type="RP"><i>. Jazz</i><c>, jazz</c></NS>, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance <NS type="FN"><i>show</i><c>shows</c></NS> etc. The <NS type="RJ">specified</NS> thing <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> is worth <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to remind</i><c>reminding</c></NS></i><c>remembering</c></NS> here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most <NS type="AGN"><i>tourist</i><c>tourists</c></NS> could <NS type="RV">offer</NS> what they <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>liked</c></NS>.</p>
<p>You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This <NS type="AGV"><i>remind</i><c>reminds</c></NS> me of what I experienced during my <NS type="S"><i>teeenage</i><c>teenage</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>years</c></NS>. In my country the children go to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> secondary school when they are <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the first year of <NS type="M"><c>being a</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>teenage</i><c>teenager</c></NS>. <NS type="DA"><i>Your</i><c>You</c></NS> know, this age is the <NS type="DJ"><i>trouble</i><c>troublesome</c></NS> age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. <NS type="RA"><i>These</i><c>They</c></NS> always annoy the <NS type="RP"><i>school teacher</i><c>schoolteacher</c></NS> and <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> parents. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>As</c></NS> a result of <NS type="AGA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> each other in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> class. They <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> to finish homework <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>within</c></NS> a limited time. They cannot <NS type="RV">oppose</NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the teacher, girls are not allowed to <NS type="MV"><c>wear</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> wear any <NS type="RN"><i>accessories</i><c>jewellery</c></NS>. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me <NS type="RQ"><i>much</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>amsh</i></NS> homework to do, even in the holiday. They also <NS type="TV"><i>forbidden</i><c>forbade</c></NS> me to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>have</c></NS> a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> many of my <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> had the same experience.</p>
<p>Now I'm a mother of two children. They are <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>both</c></NS> in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school. <NS type="TV"><i>Comparing</i><c>Compared</c></NS> to my experience, I want to give them <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> them and a friend <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> them. But at school, although I hope the teacher <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> give students so much homework, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>forbidden</i><c>forbid</c></NS> the <NS type="R">opposite voice</NS> of the students, there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad.</p>
<p>Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we <NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>are writing</c></NS> this letter to you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is because we would like to thank you for this short trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. We believe that the programme is very <NS type="S"><i>cood</i><c>good</c></NS> and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time <NS type="RY">especially</NS> for that.</p>
<p>The class is very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="SX"><i>exiting</i><c>exciting</c></NS></i><c>excited</c></NS> about that because the Show <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>conteins</i><c>contains</c></NS></i><c>covers</c></NS> the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>hair styles</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS>. We believe that <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> is a great opportunity because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is one of the best shows of the year<NS type="RP"><i>, also</i><c>. Also</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> majority of the class <NS type="TV"><i>never had</i><c>has never had</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>chance</c></NS> to visit a show <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> this and the most important and best part is that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> admission is Free for Students. And that we <NS type="RV"><i>found</i><c>thought</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> very good as otherwise we could not afford it.</p>
<p>We hope we do not cause any problems <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> your programme and hope that you will <NS type="SX"><i>except</i><c>accept</c></NS> our request. From all your class</p>
<p>Of course <NS type="R"><i>on</i><c>if</c></NS> you are <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the public eye, the reasons <NS type="AS"><i>are different when you want privacy</i><c>why you want privacy are different</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>. <NS type="S"><i>Becaues</i><c>Because</c></NS></i><c>, because</c></NS> if you are a politician<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>exmaple</i><c>example</c></NS>, you fear for your life. You need to protect your life <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> any danger. <NS type="S"><i>Becaue</i><c>Because</c></NS> </p>
<p>I would like to go in July <NS type="L"><i>for</i><c>because</c></NS> it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer to <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS> in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to <NS type="RV"><i>attend</i><c>go</c></NS> to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>be in</c></NS> the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing.</p>
<p>I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to <NS type="R"><i>be aware of</i><c>know</c></NS> what clothes I should take. Another thing I am interested in is general information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> prices in the USA.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be <NS type="UJ"><i>long</i></NS> enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> other holidays because for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Easter holiday I need to <NS type="RV"><i>attend</i><c>take part in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Tennis competition <NS type="R">in the name of</NS> my school and we need time to practise. In <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="RN">ferry trip</NS> with my relatives. <NS type="AGD"><i>That</i><c>Those</c></NS> are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other <NS type="AGN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS>. I do <NS type="S"><i>appologize</i><c>apologize</c></NS> about that.</p>
<p>I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I <NS type="TV"><i>say</i><c>said</c></NS> before<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> I have to <NS type="RV"><i>attend</i><c>take part in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tennis competition<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9<NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county <NS type="RN">player</NS> <NS type="MC"><c>when</c></NS> I was 12. I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>attended</i><c>took part in</c></NS></i><c>have taken part in</c></NS> 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad <NS type="RV"><i>influences</i><c>encourages</c></NS> me to play tennis and <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> enjoy it. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> climbing, I started to be interested in it <NS type="RC"><i>since</i><c>when</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>I</c></NS> was 14. My family live near the sea so we <NS type="TV"><i>have got</i><c>get</c></NS> quite a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>chance</i><c>chances</c></NS> to go climbing. I'm not scared of <NS type="FN"><i>height</i><c>heights</c></NS> and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.</p>
<p>As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>liked</c></NS> it and <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> quite good marks for my project<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether <NS type="AGA"><i>I</i><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS></i><c>would</c></NS> be able and willing to help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the concert in two <NS type="MP"><i>weeks</i><c>weeks'</c></NS> time in the concert hall. I immediately <NS type="TV"><i>say</i><c>said</c></NS> "yes" and <NS type="R"><i>also</i><c>so did</c></NS> my friend. I really <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>thought</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>sounds</i><c>sounded</c></NS> so interesting. I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> never done light and sound for <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> real pop concert before and I <NS type="TV"><i>think</i><c>thought</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be a good experience for me. Actually <NS type="TV"><i>I've</i><c>I'd</c></NS> just done light and sound <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>drama's</i><c>drama</c></NS> day <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> my school at the end of last term. But this time <NS type="TV"><i>it'll</i><c>it'd</c></NS> be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p><NS type="ID">At the end of the day</NS>, my ambition is to be like one of <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>those</c></NS> professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> me <NS type="TV"><i>to try</i><c>try</c></NS> to work very hard and this term I <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much<NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> I have my aim <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder.</p>
<p>Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> the show, we will be able to see the latest <NS type="FN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>leisure and sports wear</i><c>leisure- and sports-wear</c></NS>, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles. It <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>is</c></NS> essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. <NS type="UD"><i>The entrance</i><c>Entrance</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>fee</i></NS> is free for students so the show is well worth seeing.</p>
<p>The pop singer <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert <NS type="TV"><i>was start</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 7.00 p.m. At that time I was <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the second floor where I had to work <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS>. <NS type="R">I did a part of gard job.</NS> I stood up in front of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>audiences</i><c>audience</c></NS> and <NS type="R">I had given an attention to them</NS>. I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs. I thought if you were here I could really enjoy <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> with you.</p>
<p>I must say though, I would have to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it's the summer <NS type="S"><i>holydays</i><c>holidays</c></NS> for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> if <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> is possible.</p>
<p>Well, you want to know what I did <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert? Help..</p>
<p>To sum up, there are many other discoveries <NS type="R"><i>in relation</i><c>related</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology which affect my daily life. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it would <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>take</c></NS> too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you <NS type="R"><i>also know</i><c>are also familiar with</c></NS> them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is very hot and I prefer going <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> summer to going <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> winter or during <NS type="MQ"><c>it</c></NS> other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> would be impossible to do.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Thirsthly</i><c>Thirdly</c></NS>, I would prefer to <NS type="FV"><i>swimming</i><c>swim</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i>playing</i><c>play</c></NS> tennis, because I have been <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>doing</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>this</c></NS> since I was I child, and I think I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> each <NS type="R"><i>other</i><c>activity</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> everything is provided <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> the organisers. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take.</p>
<p>What I really liked doing was <NS type="FV"><i>to helped</i><c>helping</c></NS> them with their clothes and <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> make-up <NS type="UA"><i>them</i></NS>, because I learnt how to <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> make-up <NS type="R"><i>a</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>person</i><c>someone</c></NS> and I <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> a few minutes with the most popular <NS type="S"><i>grup</i><c>group</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS></i><c>Concerning</c></NS> the table <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> activities, I <NS type="TV"><i>will choose</i><c>choose</c></NS> singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and <NS type="M"><c>have been a</c></NS> very <NS type="RJ"><i>fanatic</i><c>keen</c></NS> singer from <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very young <NS type="MN"><c>age</c></NS>. I joined my choir<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts.</p>
<p>I am really impressed <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> your interest <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> my experience <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and <NS type="R">things have to deal with that</NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, if <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> possible I would like to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>camping</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I think <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is a relaxing place <NS type="UY"><i>where</i></NS> to stay. <NS type="RY"><i>Further</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS> because I like to live in contact with <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature. Also <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is possible to meet a lot of people, and <NS type="FV"><i>chatting</i><c>to chat</c></NS> during the night, <NS type="RY"><i>might</i><c>perhaps</c></NS> around the fire, playing a <NS type="DN">clutone</NS> and singing<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I think <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is a nice way to have fun.</p>
<p>To begin with the <NS type="S"><i>wchool</i><c>school</c></NS> rules<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>for</c></NS> your lesson, you have to apologize <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> to your teacher. Also<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when you have forgotten to do your <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS>. What's more, you had better <NS type="FV"><i>have done</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>if</i><c>or</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>would have</i><c>will have</c></NS> to go to the blackboard!</p>
<p>I would like to complain <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> four things <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>concerning</c></NS> your theatre. <NS type="SX"><i>Fist</i><c>First</c></NS> thing, the actor is <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> horrible so I recommend you <NS type="FV"><i>to change</i><c>change</c></NS> the actor because he will <NS type="AS"><i>make an audience who <NS type="AGV"><i>visit</i><c>visits</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> theatre disappoint</i><c>disappoint an audience who visits your theatre</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the advertisement, it said <NS type="R">tickets £ 10, £ 15 and £ 20 discounts available</NS> but when I bought the ticket, the discounts <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>were</c></NS> not available</p>
<p>Another example is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>get</c></NS> the news by using <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the computer.</p>
<p>To sum up, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways. Therefore my daily life will change <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> bad ways or goods ways<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> depends on how I use the technology.</p>
<p>The show is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> 14th March on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>That</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>means</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning <NS type="M"><c>and lasts</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> 19.00. My friends told me that if we wake up early on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> we can go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Science Museum <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> about 8.00 in the morning. Your afternoon plan is <NS type="MV"><c>to go</c></NS> shopping but we can do our shopping on Wednesday afternoon because we will have <NS type="UV"><i>got</i></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> free time on Wednesday.</p>
<p>I'd like to tell you something about the show. It is in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall and it is free <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> students. It is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great opportunity for us because when we go there we will <NS type="RV"><i>be aware of</i><c>learn</c></NS> about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> latest fashions news, we will see leisure and sports wear, all<NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> new <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> designers (<NS type="R">especially for girls</NS>) and different hairstyles.</p>
<p>Now IT (information technology) is <NS type="R">in</NS> our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we <NS type="TV"><i>won't need</i><c>don't need</c></NS> to go <NS type="RA"><i>somewhere</i><c>anywhere</c></NS> to get <NS type="RD"><i>some</i><c>the</c></NS> information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>via</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer and someone will bring <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. It means we'll lose our social <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS></i><c>life</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> accommodation<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would rather <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>stay</c></NS> in a tent<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I want to enjoy <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>wild life</i><c>wildlife</c></NS> and admire the landscape.</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe it! I was working helping to <NS type="DV"><i>mantle</i><c>build</c></NS> and dismantle the stage<NS type="RP"><i>, sometimes</i><c>. Sometimes</c></NS> I had to check the sound by saying something <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>into</c></NS> the microphone<NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I <NS type="SX"><i>sand</i><c>sang</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>duo</i><c>duet</c></NS> with the vocalist of the group<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was such <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> great fun!</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> prize <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Due to</i><c>Because of</c></NS> my business, I am very busy and <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is the best <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>time</c></NS> for my business so<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I can't <NS type="RT"><i>manage</i><c>organise</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>my</i><c>any</c></NS> time to go on holiday<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning <NS type="FV"><i>swimming</i><c>to swim</c></NS> for the last eight months and I <NS type="TV"><i>really enjoyed</i><c>have been really enjoying</c></NS> it. Another sport I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>experience</i><c>play</c></NS></i><c>have played</c></NS> is Basketball<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I used to play for <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> school's team when I <NS type="RV"><i>studied</i><c>was</c></NS> at secondary school. I have not been <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>playing</c></NS> it at all recently but only wish I had. This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again.</p>
<p>I need some <NS type="W"><i>information about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme more</i><c>more information about the programme</c></NS>. Because <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> my class want to go <NS type="M"><c>to the</c></NS> London Fashion and Leisure show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> your programme <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> we need some <NS type="AGN"><i>timetable</i><c>timetables</c></NS> and <NS type="S">frieds</NS><NS type="U"><i>. For</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>their</i><c>there</c></NS>. <NS type="DA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>your</i><c>Your</c></NS></i><c>You</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> tell <NS type="MA"><c>us</c></NS> any <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>detile</i><c>detail</c></NS></i><c>details</c></NS> about how <NS type="SX"><i>must</i><c>much</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="S"><i>coses</i><c>costs</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>For</i><c>for</c></NS> ticket</i><c>ticket costs</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>in siend</i><c>inside</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK <NS type="RV"><i>playing</i><c>performing</c></NS> as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>until</c></NS> 20:15.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>In</c></NS> recent years, as Information Technology has been improved <NS type="RY"><i>highly</i><c>greatly</c></NS>, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> same as before.</p>
<p>I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> library. I am able to meet my friends quickly <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> just clicking the mouse. In addition to these <NS type="MN"><c>things</c></NS>, I can contact <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> anyone who I want to talk <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed.</p>
<p>It is causing some changes <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> me. So, now I would rather send <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> e-mail than <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster.</p>
<p>13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Korean children in Brighton about <NS type="RN"><i>Korean</i><c>Korea</c></NS> and Korean history in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> early August. Secondly, I would like to stay <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which <NS type="S"><i>doen't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.</p>
<p>Firstly, you cannot always get the right <NS type="R"><i>one</i><c>thing</c></NS> although you scour <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>your</i></NS> feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> on <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> special <NS type="FN"><i>occasion</i><c>occasions</c></NS> like <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> sale. Secondly, you cannot <NS type="RV">exclude</NS> that you might get <NS type="M"><c>robbed by</c></NS> a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>how</c></NS> you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet <NS type="U"><i>from home</i></NS>.</p>
<p>To sum up, you should spend money <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>according to</c></NS> your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable.</p>
<p>Shopping is <NS type="M"><c>a part of</c></NS> my everyday life. I'm a mother of four <NS type="UN"><i>children</i></NS> and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (<NS type="S"><i>monstruous</i><c>monstrous</c></NS>) and goes on <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But <NS type="RJ"><i>unlikely</i><c>contrary</c></NS> to what you <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>might</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>think</i><c>expect</c></NS>, I love shopping. I find it <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very relaxing <NS type="UN"><i>moment</i></NS>. At home, you have to work hard and you're often <NS type="RJ"><i>stressful</i><c>stressed</c></NS> because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> your children <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what <NS type="TV"><i>you're seeing</i><c>you see</c></NS>. Your only <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>task</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>consist</i><c>consists</c></NS> in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream!</p>
<p>To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one <NS type="RN"><i>disadvantage</i><c>drawback</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> shopping: you need money!</p>
<p>Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> our trip. We have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go to the show. We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to replace</i><c>replacing</c></NS> the shopping <NS type="RN"><i>part</i><c>trip</c></NS> on Tuesday afternoon <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> the visit <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London <NS type="RY"><i>sometimes</i><c>sometime</c></NS> later.</p>
<p>Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the programme. We are sure this is suitable <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> all of us. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>You want <NS type="UV"><i>to know</i></NS> some further information from me. About the date<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when I want to travel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> can I say that it is only possible for me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have to do some exams at <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school. <NS type="W"><i>I would prefer <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the accommodation at the camp</i><c>Regarding the accommodation at the camp, I would prefer</c></NS> a tent<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>.  The</c></NS> reason is that I like to live <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>natural</i><c>naturally</c></NS> and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>cabins</i><c>cabin</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>As</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me. In basketball I have <NS type="MV"><c>had</c></NS> more <NS type="DN"><i>practise</i><c>practice</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> in tennis. I play every weekend <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> competitions with my local team and <NS type="R">about tennis it is that I tried but it is not like my basketball experience</NS>.</p>
<p>How are you my lovely penfriend? <NS type="W"><i>I hope <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS></i><c>Well, I hope</c></NS>. You want to know how <NS type="W"><i>was it</i><c>it was</c></NS> to work and help at a pop concert? It <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>marvelous</i><c>marvellous</c></NS>. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>help</i><c>to help</c></NS> to bring the <NS type="RN"><i>staff</i><c>stuff</c></NS> for the band, things like guitars, drums and <NS type="R"><i>others</i><c>other things</c></NS>. It was <NS type="UY"><i>maybe</i></NS> hard work for a while but I was so happy <NS type="U"><i>about that</i></NS> to help <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> a <NS type="L"><i>real</i><c>really</c></NS> big pop concert I can't <NS type="S"><i>decribe</i><c>describe</c></NS> it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and <NS type="RN"><i>diner</i><c>dinner</c></NS> for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, <NS type="RC"><i>when</i><c>if</c></NS> not the greatest experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life. On the other hand it was a <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="RY"><i>good paid</i><c>well paid</c></NS></i><c>well-paid</c></NS> job <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> 15 pounds per hour<NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>.  What</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>you can</i><c>can you</c></NS> say<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>!</c></NS></p>
<p>Thank you very much for the prize. I <NS type="RV"><i>turned</i><c>went</c></NS> crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition. I am <NS type="UY"><i>just</i></NS> looking forward to going to Camp California. I've never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the States before and having the chance to do <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> so makes me <NS type="L"><i>real</i><c>really</c></NS> happy.</p>
<p>As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> the task, but that did not make it much easier.</p>
<p>The only <NS type="UQ"><i>one</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>term</i><c>time</c></NS> for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>?</c></NS> I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights <NS type="R">in hol.</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July are hot. <NS type="MD"><i>Tent</i><c>A tent</c></NS> will be <NS type="IJ"><i>more cooler</i><c>cooler</c></NS> to sleep <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> cabin.</p>
<p>I <NS type="S"><i>apprieciate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> shops for lots of products, <NS type="SX"><i>cheep</i><c>cheap</c></NS> prices <NS type="SX"><i>end</i><c>and</c></NS> big spaces. But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread. On <NS type="S"><i>Friedy</i><c>Friday</c></NS> evening and <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> on the weekdays <NS type="CQ"><i>each</i><c>all</c></NS> supermarkets are crowded. They are filled <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> people who <NS type="SX"><i>went</i><c>want</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>buy</i><c>to buy</c></NS> everything.</p>
<p>Maybe you could explain to me<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> what the problems were. By problems I mean<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> were no discounts <NS type="S"><i>avaivable</i><c>available</c></NS>? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were <NS type="S"><i>diffrent</i><c>different</c></NS> actors <NS type="M"><c>to those advertised</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> were not very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.</p>
<p>It wasn't <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> a perfect evening <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> you promised on your flyer. I was very <NS type="S"><i>disapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern technology <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>has made</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and <NS type="RP"><i>noone</i><c>no one</c></NS> had an <NS type="S"><i>opertunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to fly to another country for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the <NS type="S"><i>opertunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to just get into a car and drive <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>where ever</i><c>wherever</c></NS> they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>onto</c></NS> the Internet to get any information you need. <NS type="UD"><i>Every production</i><c>Production</c></NS> is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>worker</i><c>workers</c></NS> anymore. <NS type="RP"><i>Every thing</i><c>Everything</c></NS> is controlled and produced by machines. This <NS type="W"><i>also is</i><c>is also</c></NS> a very big <NS type="S"><i>disatvantage</i><c>disadvantage</c></NS> because many people are losing <NS type="S"><i>thier</i><c>their</c></NS> jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that <NS type="RP"><i>every one</i><c>everyone</c></NS> becomes a bit more lonely because they <NS type="S"><i>wath</i><c>watch</c></NS> TV or play or work <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the Computer and don't see each other <NS type="RP"><i>any more</i><c>anymore</c></NS> because they don't have to. You never get bored.</p>
<p>While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, "Over The Rainbow", because I had read the <NS type="SX"><i>add</i><c>ad</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was.</p>
<p>One of the <NS type="AGN"><i>reason</i><c>reasons</c></NS> I went to see that particular show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was the starring actor<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> announced in the <NS type="SX"><i>add</i><c>ad</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>after</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The <NS type="SX"><i>add</i><c>ad</c></NS> also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> than a tent and less hot <NS type="R">with the sun</NS>. <NS type="RY"><i>Nevertheless</i><c>However</c></NS>, I hope, there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> water and light inside this log <NS type="S"><i>cabine</i><c>cabin</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Between</i><c>From</c></NS> your different activities, I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> like to <NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS>:</p>
<p>2. Photography because <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>in</c></NS> my <NS type="RP"><i>freetime</i><c>free time</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>take</c></NS> some pictures <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS>, <NS type="RN"><i>country</i><c>countryside</c></NS>, -- - So, I <NS type="UV"><i>will</i></NS> want to have more experience and a better technique to</p>
<p><NS type="DY">Nowthere,</NS> I would like <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>to know</c></NS> if it's possible to change my activities during my <NS type="DN"><i>sejar</i><c>stay</c></NS>. Can I change some <NS type="CN"><i>moneys</i><c>money</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS> or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>there</c></NS> different prices for the same <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>?</p>
<p>In England, <NS type="CE">there aren't paper for make a present</NS>. It's different <NS type="RT"><i>than</i><c>to</c></NS> the other European countries.</p>
<p>I am writing to you, <NS type="RT"><i>in the name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> all the students in my class, to tell you about our wish to change the <NS type="UP"><i>London's</i><c>London</c></NS> programme. I would also like to thank you for the <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme you <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>organized</c></NS> for us, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>especially</i><c>in particular</c></NS> the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which is going to take place at the <NS type="UP"><i>"</i></NS>Central <NS type="S"><i>Exibition</i><c>Exhibition</c></NS> Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles will be shown <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this occasion. We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes <NS type="RN"><i>part</i><c>place</c></NS> only once a year and, on top of all <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>, it is free for students.</p>
<p>The path we were walking <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>nor</i><c>neither</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> bridge nor a canoe<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> only way to cross it was <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> walking on <NS type="W"><i>an old big</i><c>a big old</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>tree</c></NS> trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only <NS type="RN"><i>connection</i><c>bridge</c></NS> between our side and the other.</p>
<p>I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities. Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some <NS type="AGN"><i>picture</i><c>pictures</c></NS> of beautiful <NS type="CN"><i><NS type="S"><i>scenaries</i><c>sceneries</c></NS></i><c>scenery</c></NS> in California. <NS type="RT"><i>As</i><c>After</c></NS> photography, swimming is my best <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>method</c></NS> of relaxation. It would be <NS type="RJ"><i>grateful</i><c>great</c></NS> if I could go swimming during the <NS type="FN"><i>stays</i><c>stay</c></NS>.</p>
<p>To sum up, although there is certainly a good side <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> shopping, such as <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to know which <NS type="RP"><i>air line</i><c>airline</c></NS> I will be <NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> and if it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> possible can you send me more information about <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Camp California. Also I would like to know how long I will be staying at this camp so I can <NS type="RV"><i>prepare</i><c>decide</c></NS> how much money I'm going to need and how many clothes I'm going to take.</p>
<p>I think Science <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> one of the interesting <NS type="AGN"><i>subject</i><c>subjects</c></NS> in school. It is very interesting and fun <NS type="R">with the</NS> <NS type="S"><i>experement</i><c>experiment</c></NS>. <NS type="FN"><i>Lot and lot</i><c>Lots and lots</c></NS> of <NS type="S"><i>experements</i><c>experiments</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>which</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>give out</i><c>produce</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>quit</i><c>quite</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>interest</i><c>interesting</c></NS> and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life. We can see a lot of <NS type="DJ"><i>interest</i><c>interested</c></NS> faces <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>among</c></NS> the students <NS type="S"><i>wile</i><c>while</c></NS> we <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> filming them. Also it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> not a very easy subject so we can capture other <NS type="MP"><i>students</i><c>students'</c></NS> faces in <NS type="DN"><i>confuse</i><c>confusion</c></NS> and <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>puzzal</i><c>puzzle</c></NS></i><c>puzzlement</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, <NS type="R"><i>as far as</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming <NS type="RC"><i>as well as</i><c>and</c></NS> tennis. I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home. I do <NS type="W"><i>sports a lot</i><c>a lot of sports</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so apart from <NS type="MV"><c>playing</c></NS> tennis I am a member <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> our local swimming centre. I can <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>reasure</i><c>reassure</c></NS></i><c>assure</c></NS> you that <NS type="W"><i>gradually I am</i><c>I am gradually</c></NS> improving my sports skills.</p>
<p>As I've told you, last month I went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> a pop concert and I really <NS type="TV"><i>enjoy</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over <NS type="RP"><i>4.000</i><c>4,000</c></NS> seats for the "<NS type="S"><i>spactetors</i><c>spectators</c></NS>" if you can call them <NS type="R"><i>like this</i><c>that</c></NS>. Can you imagine?</p>
<p>Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that <NS type="TV"><i>I've gained</i><c>I gained</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>from</c></NS> it! I've learned the meaning of the words "reliability" and "responsibility". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is <NS type="M"></NS> far more enjoyable and relaxing.</p>
<p>I am writing to <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> your advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the "London Fashion" and "Leisure Show". Thank you for organising this <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme, especially the Leisure show, which <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> very <NS type="DJ"><i>interest</i><c>interesting</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> us. So all of our class would like to go to the show during <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>their</c></NS> three days in London. But there is a problem which I hope you can solve.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Concerning</c></NS> your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which <NS type="TV"><i>included</i><c>include</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> sightseeing by bus, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> River trip to Greenwich, <NS type="M"><c>visiting the</c></NS> Science Museum and National Art Gallery <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. <NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>At</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> we can see the latest <NS type="FN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>imagintive</i><c>imaginative</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles. What is more they are <NS type="R">the Leisure and sports wear</NS>, which we are keen on seeing <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. In your advertisement, you <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> written "The show will be <NS type="RV"><i>help</i><c>held</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition hall in London<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>starts</i><c>runs</c></NS> from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March.<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS></p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="ID"><i>on our class behalf</i><c>on behalf of our class</c></NS> to thank you for organising our <NS type="RT"><i>tour</i><c>trip</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. Our class is very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>appritiate</i><c>appreciative</c></NS></i><c>grateful to</c></NS> you for the <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme. <NS type="W"><i>Especially, we are</i><c>We are especially</c></NS> interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon. It is a good idea to include the <NS type="DN"><i>visiting</i><c>visit</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> morning <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> on Tuesday and Wednesday <NS type="DY"><i>respectivelly</i><c>respectively</c></NS>.</p>
<p>However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show. It is a great opportunity <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> the following reasons. Firstly, there will be <NS type="S"><i>leisur</i><c>leisure</c></NS> and sports wear and the latest <NS type="S"><i>fasions</i><c>fashions</c></NS>. Secondly, there will be <NS type="S"><i>exibitions</i><c>exhibitions</c></NS> about makeup and <NS type="RP"><i>hair styles</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS>. Moreover, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> entrance for students is free.</p>
<p>In my opinion, each human being has <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>rights</i><c>right</c></NS> to be free. We can go for a <NS type="S"><i>wolk</i><c>walk</c></NS>, go shopping<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> go to the cinema, <NS type="MV"><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="DV"><i><NS type="S"><i>marrige</i><c>marriage</c></NS></i><c>married</c></NS> or <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>devorce</i><c>divorce</c></NS></i><c>divorced</c></NS>. Why <NS type="W"><i>famous people <NS type="TV"><i>couldn't</i><c>can't</c></NS></i><c>can't famous people</c></NS> do all <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> things? Why <NS type="W"><i>everybody must</i><c>must everybody</c></NS> know and <NS type="S"><i>tolk</i><c>talk</c></NS> about their private life? The most important thing <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> famous people are also normal people <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> us. They live <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> us, they <NS type="RV"><i>brief</i><c>breathe</c></NS> and eat <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> us, they even <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>following</i><c>follow</c></NS></i><c>fall</c></NS> in love <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> us. I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> they <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>should</c></NS> have a normal<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> private life without journalists following them all the time and without any <NS type="RJ">exact</NS> details about them <NS type="MV"><c>appearing</c></NS> in the different <NS type="RP"><i>newspaper's</i><c>newspapers'</c></NS> <NS type="DN">curiouses</NS>.</p>
<p>In your advertisement I read the times <NS type="M"><c>of the performances</c></NS>, <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> 14.30 and 10.30, however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20.15! So <NS type="TV"><i>I've been</i><c>I was</c></NS> doing <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nothing for a long time and I don't like to <NS type="RV"><i>lose</i><c>waste</c></NS> my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove?<NS type="RP"><i>, where</i><c> Where</c></NS> were they <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> last weekend? <NS type="UD"><i><NS type="RP"><i>the</i><c>The</c></NS> last</i><c>Last</c></NS> weekend <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> was a different actor who was disappointing. To make the evening worse <NS type="AS"><i>the tickets were <NS type="RD"><i>not</i><c>no</c></NS> discounts available</i><c>there were no discounts available on the tickets</c></NS>, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over.</p>
<p>I am writing to explain some aspects <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> your show. It was a <NS type="S"><i>desaster</i><c>disaster</c></NS> and I am <NS type="MV"><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>telling</i><c>to tell</c></NS> you why.</p>
<p>To sum up, technology <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> the best thing <NS type="RT"><i>around</i><c>in</c></NS> the world, apart from T.V.</p>
<p>Why did you put <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? <NS type="AGA"><i>It</i><c>They</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="S"><i>wasen't</i><c>wasn't</c></NS></i><c>weren't</c></NS>!!! <NS type="R"><i>Any kinds of</i><c>All</c></NS> tickets were <NS type="M"><c>sold at the</c></NS> original <NS type="S"><i>prase</i><c>price</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>Within</c></NS> a week <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> my classmates and teachers started <NS type="FV"><i>to <NS type="S"><i>toking</i><c>talking</c></NS></i><c>to talk</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> me. I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>understand</i><c>understood</c></NS></i><c>knew</c></NS> who <NS type="TV"><i>told</i><c>had told</c></NS> my secret to everyone. I got <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>big</i><c>bit</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>dipress</i><c>depressed</c></NS> but my parents supported me. We had a <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>long</c></NS> conversation. They stopped me <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>doing</c></NS></i><c>having</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>operetion</i><c>operation</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to travel in July because I will have my <NS type="R"><i>off</i><c>holiday</c></NS> in July. I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent. I think it would be more comfortable than a tent. I want to <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>attend</c></NS> swimming and tennis courses. I have been swimming <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>since</c></NS> <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> five years of age <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> until 1993 <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>as</i><c>was</c></NS> a member of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> school team. I am good at <NS type="CE">timing on swim</NS>. I am also good at playing tennis. I won a prize in a competition in 1999.</p>
<p>If you <NS type="MV"><c>could</c></NS> reply <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> my letter <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 28th of June <NS type="TV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'd</c></NS> be <NS type="RJ"><i>pleased</i><c>grateful</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>with it</i></NS> because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company.</p>
<p>We have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few possibilities. We can look <NS type="RT"><i>up</i><c>in</c></NS> a magazine or a <NS type="RN">booklet</NS> which <NS type="TV"><i>deliver</i><c>is delivered</c></NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> newspaper weekly. We can order a free <NS type="RN"><i>book</i><c>catalogue</c></NS> from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> internet <NS type="RN"><i>shops</i><c>shopping</c></NS><NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="UY"><i>recently</i></NS> so</i><c>. So</c></NS> you don't need to see <NS type="DJ"><i>long-face</i><c>long-faced</c></NS> <NS type="IN"><i>staffs</i><c>staff</c></NS> in the shops. You won't wait in the <NS type="S"><i>quee</i><c>queue</c></NS>. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the two weeks in California I <NS type="TV"><i>won</i><c>have won</c></NS> in the competition. California has always been in my dreams.</p>
<p>I look forward to <NS type="RV"><i>reading</i><c>hearing</c></NS> from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> (0297) 8245123 <NS type="R"><i>in case of need</i><c>in case you should need me</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to inquire whether <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>regarding</c></NS> travel. Indeed I would rather <NS type="FV"><i>to travel</i><c>travel</c></NS> only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July since I'm going to work in <NS type="RP"><i>august</i><c>August</c></NS> in order to earn money to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> my studies next year.</p>
<p><NS type="UT"><i>Besides</i></NS> I've chosen two activities from the list: <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><c>(</c></NS>as I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> this sport regularly and I'm very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this activity<NS type="MP"><c>)</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS> because I <NS type="RV"><i>ignore</i><c>don't know</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>anything</c></NS> about this sport and I wish <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>will</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>discover</i><c>to find out about</c></NS> it <NS type="U"><i>thanks to you</i></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Besides</i><c>Also</c></NS> I would suggest filming <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> lunch <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of <NS type="FN"><i>noises</i><c>noise</c></NS> inside the restaurant because of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>babbles</i><c>babbling</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Do you mind <NS type="FV"><i>tell</i><c>telling</c></NS> me what <NS type="AS"><i>is the weather</i><c>the weather will be</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>like</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> holiday, what kind <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> money I should bring with me and what language I should <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>speak</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> there?</p>
<p>When you go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> shopping with your <NS type="RP"><i>girl friend</i><c>girlfriend</c></NS>, she <NS type="AGV"><i>want</i><c>wants</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>watch</i><c>look at</c></NS> every <NS type="MN"><c>item of</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>clothes</i><c>clothing</c></NS> in the shopping centre, but you are not <NS type="RJ"><i>interesting</i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> that<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="S"><i>romatic</i><c>romantic</c></NS></i><c>. Romantic</c></NS>, no! I think you will feel <NS type="RJ"><i>boring</i><c>bored</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Then, the time <NS type="RV"><i>marked</i><c>stated</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>as</c></NS> the beginning <NS type="M"><c>of the show</c></NS> was 19:30 and <NS type="DY"><i>unfortunatly</i><c>unfortunately</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>he</i><c>it</c></NS> began at 20:15.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He has a <NS type="RP"><i>bestfriend</i><c>best friend</c></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> was more like a brother <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> him. They always <NS type="TV"><i>done</i><c>did</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> together, and they were the most popular boys in school<NS type="RP"><i>, both</i><c>. Both</c></NS> were very <NS type="S"><i>hanson</i><c>handsome</c></NS>, played football<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> they were <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> example for everybody. <NS type="M"><i>Before</i><c>That was before</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>the</c></NS> day<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when Pat discovered that his brother was gay<NS type="RP"><i>, after</i><c>. After</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> their relationship <NS type="TV"><i>has change</i><c>changed</c></NS>. Pat was very frightened <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> this situation.</p>
<p>Unable to keep a secret he told <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> everyone, ended his friendship with Ted<NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> Ted is <NS type="DJ"><i>rejective</i><c>rejected</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his <NS type="S"><i>honestity</i><c>honesty</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thank you very much <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> your letter<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>I would like to give you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and the others in the class my opinion (<NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>concerning</c></NS> the video that you are going to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>make</c></NS>) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why.</p>
<p>Well, <NS type="ID"><i>in my point of view</i><c>from my point of view</c></NS> the most interesting lessons that we <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>have</c></NS> at school <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>in real life are useful</i><c>are useful in real life</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> the same reason <NS type="R"><i>as maths</i><c>that maths is important</c></NS>. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>should</c></NS> all know WHERE we live, what <NS type="W"><i>are the problems</i><c>the problems are</c></NS> that we have in this world, what problem <NS type="UV"><i>does</i></NS> every different country <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> and where <NS type="UV"><i>does</i></NS> the petroleum <NS type="AGV"><i>come</i><c>comes</c></NS> from and what <NS type="W"><i>are the advantages and disadvantages <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>using</c></NS> it</i><c>the advantages and disadvantages of using it are</c></NS> and <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the gold as well<NS type="RP"><i>, there</i><c>. There</c></NS> are loads of <NS type="SX"><i>thinks</i><c>things</c></NS> about geography that we <NS type="TV"><i>MUST KNOW</i><c>OUGHT TO KNOW</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the <NS type="DN"><i>video film</i><c>video</c></NS>. You can put <NS type="MY"><c>in</c></NS> a few activities (sports) like basketball, football, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> tennis, but only those because <NS type="DA"><i>their</i><c>they</c></NS> are very popular and people will <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>interest</i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> them.</p>
<p>My name is German Schmidt <NS type="R"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>in the</i></NS> last week I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". There <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> some problems<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we have to speak about.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>First</c></NS>, the actor was not Danny Brook<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> there was a different actor, who I don't know. In the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was written that the musical <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.</p>
<p>After the <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show I <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>First</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> say that our <NS type="W"><i>technology level</i><c>level of technology</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="MJ"><c>present</c></NS> time <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> very high but in the future it <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be higher.</p>
<p>One <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>example</c></NS> in my life is home banking. With the help of my home computer I can do all <NS type="MN"><c>kinds of</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> money, with my bank. Some years ago I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> to go to the bank. The new way is very easy and faster and I can <NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> my time <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> other things. <NS type="RP"><i>An other</i><c>Another</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>example</c></NS> is the modern technology in my car. Because of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology, the safety level <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my car is very high.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but your musical show was very disappointing to me. I was very disappointed. <NS type="MD"><i>Lot</i><c>A lot</c></NS> of things that you <NS type="RV"><i>have written</i><c>wrote</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement are not true.</p>
<p>Also the show did not start at half past seven <NS type="UY"><i>o'clock</i></NS> as it <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> said but at eight <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> fifteen <NS type="UY"><i>o'clock</i></NS>. Everyone get bored <NS type="MV"><c>waiting</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>for</c></NS> the show <NS type="FV"><i>start</i><c>to start</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> as it was closed. <NS type="W"><i>Everyone after the show</i><c>After the show everyone</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>run</i><c>ran</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> a good seat <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the restaurant but everyone <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> disappointed when they <NS type="TV"><i>see</i><c>saw</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>sight</i><c>sign</c></NS> which said "<NS type="RJ"><i>Close</i><c>Closed</c></NS> for today".</p>
<p>It was Saturday when I called her and <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> her to go for a walk <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the park, which was not very far away from our houses. I had never told her a secret before but this time<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I was going to tell her. The secret was about our friend Maria who was very kind <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> everyone<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I told her that I <NS type="TV"><i>have heard</i><c>had heard</c></NS> that Maria had <NS type="RN">concern</NS>. Pat told me that she would not <NS type="FV"><i>told</i><c>tell</c></NS> that to anyone but the other day I learnt that all the school <NS type="TV"><i>had known</i><c>knew</c></NS> about Maria.</p>
<p>I was sure that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was Pat who told <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> everyone. After that I had an argument with Pat and then she told me that she <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>told</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> only <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> one person. I was very sad <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> what Pat <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>had done</c></NS> and I didn't speak to her for a long time.</p>
<p>My name is Agripina T. I just <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>recive</i><c>receive</c></NS></i><c>received</c></NS> your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions. I would like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it's the only month when I'm free. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> June I have to take some English lessons. I would prefer to <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS> in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents. I don't really like <NS type="RV"><i>living</i><c>staying</c></NS> in tents. If it's possible to <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS> in log cabins I'll be pleased. While I'm at the Camp, I would like to do two <NS type="M"><c>of my</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which are basketball and singing. I love to play basketball. I'm not good at it but I try my best. <NS type="RY"><i>Before</i><c>In the past</c></NS> I was in a basketball team and I <NS type="IV"><i>enjoyded</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> a lot. Also I like singing. In future I would like to be a singer. I like this kind of activity. There is something else I would like to ask. At the Camp, is there a free uniform or <NS type="W"><i>we will</i><c>will we</c></NS> have to wear something <NS type="S"><i>spessial</i><c>special</c></NS>? Also I would like to ask about money. How much money should I take with me? And is it <NS type="S"><i>nesessary</i><c>necessary</c></NS> to bring money, will we need <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS>?</p>
<p>I suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to film</i><c>filming</c></NS> our English lessons and <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS> lessons. From <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> activities I suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to film</i><c>filming</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> lessons<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>working</c></NS>, but <NS type="SX"><i>us</i><c>as</c></NS> we work, <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything <NS type="S"><i>spessial</i><c>special</c></NS>. It's not true. We <NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS> our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way <NS type="UY"><i>how</i></NS> they do. Also <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS> because they think that it's <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>boreing</i><c>boring</c></NS> subject. I think <NS type="UV"><i>it's</i><c>it</c></NS> all depends <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> teacher. Our <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about <NS type="SA"><i>Math</i><c>Maths</c></NS>. For activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we should film <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> lessons because we always do something new. We <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>have</c></NS> many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are <NS type="S"><i>speccial</i><c>special</c></NS>. We try to play <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> many instruments, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to <NS type="S"><i>wach</i><c>watch</c></NS> others while they do something like that.</p>
<p>I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't <NS type="FV"><i>appeared</i><c>appear</c></NS>. He had been replaced by a really bad actor, <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> whom I don't even know the name. I was very <NS type="DJ"><i>disappoint</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite <NS type="AGN"><i>actor</i><c>actors</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First <NS type="RT"><i>off</i><c>of</c></NS> all, if computers <NS type="S"><i>haden't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>one</c></NS>! I use my computer for many things, such as <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS>, games, digital video or <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet.</p>
<p>First of all I <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>can</c></NS> go to Camp California only <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because I will start working <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> our local leisure centre as a swimming <NS type="S"><i>instructer</i><c>instructor</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>I would like to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log <NS type="FN"><i>cabins</i><c>cabin</c></NS> because I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>have had</c></NS> bad <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>experiens</i><c>experience</c></NS></i><c>experiences</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> tents. I do not like to stay in such a small <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>space</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Also they <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>have</c></NS> lots of <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>sale</i><c>sales</c></NS></i><c>special offers</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> everything<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>even you can</i><c>you can even</c></NS> join their <NS type="FN"><i>club</i><c>clubs</c></NS> for extra discount. It <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>look</i><c>looks</c></NS></i><c>seems</c></NS> wonderful <NS type="RP"><i>does not</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> it<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p>I have recently received a letter saying I am <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> first-prize winner <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> your competition. <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>It</c></NS> was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details.</p>
<p>I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> a high street to go shopping. For me, that <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>meant</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>window-shopping</i><c>window shopping</c></NS>. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew <NS type="SX"><i>thought</i><c>though</c></NS> that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway.</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and I would like to explain what the problems were.</p>
<p>Firstly, <NS type="UC"><i>as</i></NS> I read <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> the actor would be Danny Brook<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and this is one of the reasons why I <NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>went</c></NS> to the theatre. But <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> <NS type="M"><c>I had a </c></NS> big <NS type="S"><i>suprise</i><c>surprise</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>when</c></NS> I saw that <NS type="AS"><i>the actor was different</i><c>it was a different actor</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and I was very disappointed.</p>
<p>Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>according to</c></NS> the <NS type="RN">article</NS> the times were 14:30 and 19:30. I <NS type="IV"><i>prefered</i><c>preferred</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the <NS type="RN"><i>theatre</i><c>show</c></NS> started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting <NS type="M"><c>for it</c></NS> to start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The next morning at school everybody was looking at me <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> a strange way. Nobody was talking to me except the ten <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS> who I invited to my party.</p>
<p>After <NS type="R"><i>a big</i><c>much</c></NS> confusion<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I decided not to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>have</c></NS> a party for my birthday so I could <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS></i><c>get</c></NS> all my friends back. And that's <NS type="W"><i>what I <NS type="UV"><i>had</i></NS> exactly</i><c>exactly what I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>done</i><c>did</c></NS> even <NS type="RC"><i>if</i><c>though</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>stayed</i><c>was</c></NS> alone <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>From</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>story</i><c>experience</c></NS> I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="FA"><i>who</i><c>whom</c></NS> you can trust.</p>
<p>I was interested in the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago. However, I cannot help saying that it was really <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> nightmare.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology has been changing our life a lot <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> these days. But how <NS type="MV"><c>does</c></NS> it affect <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> radio <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> not the sound of <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the bus or even <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tube, I can talk with a friend <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>via</c></NS> a mobile phone when I feel <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>boaring</i><c>boring</c></NS></i><c>bored</c></NS>. Sometimes I even <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>play</c></NS> some games <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> it. <NS type="ID">In accordance with</NS> study or work, I use <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, which is the <NS type="IJ"><i>easist</i><c>easiest</c></NS> way to get <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects <NS type="W"><i>a lot <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> my daily life</i><c>my daily life a lot</c></NS> as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the <NS type="RN"><i>amount</i><c>extent</c></NS> of <NS type="UP"><i>it's</i><c>its</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>affection</i><c>affect</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> human life <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be more than this in the future.</p>
<p>I was angry about all of <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the actor's name.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Internet</i><c>The Internet</c></NS> has changed our daily life: you can find whatever you want. Do you want to have a different lunch? Do you want to organize a different holiday <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a strange place? You can find <NS type="W"><i>there all you need</i><c>all you need there</c></NS> and more!</p>
<p>And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop <NS type="U"><i>it's</i></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>caming</i><c>coming</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> a <NS type="DN"><i>corner's machine</i><c>vending machine</c></NS> without any <NS type="AGN"><i>coin</i><c>coins</c></NS>, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more...</p>
<p>My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> her, because she could hardly <NS type="UY"><i>ever</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>think of</i><c>expect</c></NS> such a present.</p>
<p>Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> information or <NS type="RN"><i>excuse</i><c>explanation</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>being given</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>direction</i><c>management</c></NS>. Secondly, I <NS type="S"><i>coudn't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS>. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill.</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Unfortunatly</i><c>Unfortunately</c></NS>, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The poor boy was only 5 <NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS> old and at this age<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret. So when he heard <NS type="ID"><i>at random</i><c>by chance</c></NS> that my parents were planning to <NS type="RV"><i>offer</i><c>give</c></NS> me a trip to San Fansisco as <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> present for my birthday, my little brother ran <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> my bedroom <NS type="RY"><i>wherever</i><c>where</c></NS> I was studying and whispered <NS type="W"><i>in my ear the wonderful news</i><c>the wonderful news in my ear</c></NS>. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>seat</c></NS> on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for <NS type="W"><i>already one month</i><c>one month already</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to go in July after taking my examination at <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> college <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of June. So it is impossible for me to go <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>earlier</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I hope you <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> take immediate action <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS>. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.</p>
<p>Hello. I'm Robert and I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> article about clothes in the future. In my <NS type="S"><i>oppinion</i><c>opinion</c></NS>, in a hundred <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> years<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> clothes<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> will be <NS type="R"><i>the <NS type="DN"><i>comfortability</i><c>comfort</c></NS> of them</i><c>how comfortable they are</c></NS> and the way they protect us and our <NS type="AGN"><i>body</i><c>bodies</c></NS> from temperature and physical <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>agressions</i><c>aggressions</c></NS></i><c>attacks</c></NS>. I think they will <NS type="DV"><i>cold</i><c>cool</c></NS> us in the summer and <NS type="AGV"><i>makes</i><c>make</c></NS> us <NS type="RJ"><i>hot</i><c>warmer</c></NS> in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater <NS type="R"><i>with a</i><c>at</c></NS> high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>play</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> part in <NS type="MP"><i>clothes</i><c>clothes'</c></NS> development, scientists will <NS type="RV"><i>search</i><c>find</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I <NS type="RV"><i>wish</i><c>hope</c></NS> I win the trip!</p>
<p>I <NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter and I'm very happy because I didn't expect it, so first of all I want you <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>to know</c></NS> that I really <NS type="L">fancy</NS> going <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> Camp California in the U.S.A<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> two weeks, <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> because I've never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> this country.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On one hand</i><c>On the one hand</c></NS> I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could <NS type="RV"><i>go to</i><c>take</c></NS> this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>september</i><c>September</c></NS>. If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out.</p>
<p>Finally I want to find out <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> if <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> is <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>a</c></NS> supermarket near the <NS type="RN"><i>camping</i><c>campsite</c></NS> and if there are any facilities <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> washing my <NS type="S"><i>clotches</i><c>clothes</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>on</c></NS> the camp.</p>
<p>I was very nervous because I'd never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a concert before and an hour before everything <NS type="RV"><i>stated</i><c>started</c></NS> the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>avoid</i><c>help</c></NS> it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began <NS type="FV"><i>feeling</i><c>to feel</c></NS> more comfortable and when the concert started everything was <NS type="R"><i>such</i><c>so</c></NS> exciting that the time <NS type="RV"><i>ran</i><c>went</c></NS> very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream.</p>
<p>CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS <NS type="ID">IN THE MEANTIME</NS> I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE <NS type="RT"><i>AT</i><c>OVER</c></NS> ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE <NS type="IV"><i>CHOOSEN</i><c>CHOSEN</c></NS> TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.</p>
<p>BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>FROM</c></NS> CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR <NS type="UP"><i>GIRL-FRIENDS</i><c>GIRLFRIENDS</c></NS>. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO <NS type="RV"><i>SEAT</i><c>SIT</c></NS> AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER <NS type="UN"><i>REALISATION</i></NS>. PEOPLE<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>FOR</c></NS> THIS <NS type="AGN"><i>SITUATIONS</i><c>SITUATION</c></NS> (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE <NS type="DN"><i>SHOP-ASSISTANCE</i><c>SHOP ASSISTANT</c></NS>, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE).</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter. I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I can go only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I'm a student. It's summer holiday <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> that time. I want to know if it is <NS type="S"><i>avaliabile</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> that time.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter and, firstly, I would like to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>this</c></NS> good news. I will give you the information which you asked me <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> in your letter and also <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> will ask you some questions.</p>
<p><NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>Ansering</i><c>Answering</c></NS></i><c>To answer</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming. I am quite good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> tennis, especially <NS type="IV"><i>plaing</i><c>playing</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>in two pairs</i><c>doubles</c></NS>. Also I like swimming and I've got two <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS></i><c>years'</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> teaching swimming <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>lesure</i><c>leisure</c></NS> centre.</p>
<p>Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> concentrate in a shop, <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> I can't <NS type="S"><i>relaxe</i><c>relax</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>as well</i><c>either</c></NS>. I am looking on the <NS type="IN"><i>shelfs</i><c>shelves</c></NS> but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list. Everybody <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> pushing me and I think that I came <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> wrong place.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really <NS type="S"><i>nesseceraly</i><c>necessary</c></NS>. I also understand that nobody will do that <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my place. However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> something special and <NS type="SX"><i>testy</i><c>tasty</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> your musical show "Over the rainbow" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.</p>
<p>And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were <NS type="X"><i>not</i><c>no</c></NS> discounts available. <NS type="X"><i>Both things do not agree</i><c>Neither thing agrees</c></NS> with what I read <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>advertising sign</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>going away from</i><c>leaving</c></NS> home.</p>
<p>And sometimes<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from £50 down to £20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> rich man it doesn't mater, but if you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>thoese</i><c>this</c></NS> situation!</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to you to make a <NS type="DN"><i>complain</i><c>complaint</c></NS> about the <NS type="W"><i>"Over the <NS type="RP"><i>rainbow</i><c>Rainbow</c></NS>" musical show</i><c>musical show "Over the Rainbow"</c></NS> which I saw yesterday. I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>after</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>seing</i><c>seeing</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> I expected more<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>That</i><c>The</c></NS> show was entirely different to what it says <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> .</p>
<p>Most houses have many electric devices like <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> microwave <NS type="UN"><i>machine</i></NS>, an oven<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> a mixer, a <NS type="RP"><i>dish washer</i><c>dishwasher</c></NS> and many other things which can do a job <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> the press of a button.</p>
<p>I am writing with reference to <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>arrangement</i><c>visit</c></NS> I made <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> last week.</p>
<p>I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see "Over the Rainbow" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>scene</i><c>stage</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Beside</i><c>Besides</c></NS> this, I had to wait three quarters of <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was <NS type="X">no</NS> nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and <NS type="RA"><i>they</i><c>there</c></NS> were <NS type="X"><i>no</i><c>none</c></NS> available, so, it was an expensive evening!</p>
<p>I won't <NS type="RY"><i>never</i><c>ever</c></NS> forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the <NS type="S"><i>thruth</i><c>truth</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to <NS type="RV"><i>face</i><c>cure</c></NS> it at that moment but... I <NS type="IV"><i>bursted</i><c>burst</c></NS> into <NS type="RN"><i>teas</i><c>tears</c></NS> as <NS type="R"><i>well as</i><c>did</c></NS> my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> step by step. I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>became</c></NS> conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to <NS type="AS"><i>tell it to Pat</i><c>tell Pat about it</c></NS>. I still remember her words: "Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed".</p>
<p>As <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> your questions, I am free to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>have</c></NS> my holiday after <NS type="FV"><i>finished</i><c>finishing</c></NS> the exams. And, I have to <NS type="FV"><i>returned</i><c>return</c></NS> to my university by August.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and <NS type="R">my</NS> <NS type="DN"><i>fasinative</i><c>fascination</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> art and <NS type="TV"><i>enjoyed</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to take</i><c>taking</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>photograph</i><c>photographs</c></NS> of wildlife.</p>
<p>Finally, please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring? <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> how much <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> spend there<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> Also, please <NS type="DV"><i>advice</i><c>advise</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> any <NS type="R"><i>necessary things</i><c>things it is necessary</c></NS> to prepare and bring.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I say this because of the experience I've had <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> her.</p>
<p>Actually, we were quite good friends before <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me <NS type="UT"><i>since</i></NS> this year. She <NS type="TV"><i>is sitting</i><c>sat</c></NS> next to me<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> started to chat more and more<NS type="RP"><i>, then</i><c>. Then</c></NS> we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>usually</i><c>usual</c></NS>. Suddenly my heart was <NS type="RV"><i>thumbing</i><c>thumping</c></NS> so quickly because I saw him<NS type="UP"><i>?</i></NS> - <NS type="RP"><i>A</i><c>a</c></NS> boy who <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> a new student. I know this is <NS type="R">one right love</NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I'm absolutely <NS type="S"><i>besorrted</i><c>besotted</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people <NS type="FV"><i>gossip</i><c>gossiping</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>behind</i><c>about</c></NS> me <NS type="R">then</NS> everyone would know I <NS type="TV"><i>fancy</i><c>fancied</c></NS> him. But the thing which <NS type="TV"><i>I've</i><c>I'd</c></NS> never expected <NS type="M"><i>is</i><c>happened, which is that</c></NS> Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> joke <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> it<NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> makes me feel so <NS type="S"><i>embarrised</i><c>embarrassed</c></NS>: I was very angry at that time!</p>
<p>Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> seat<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all.</p>
<p>I would rather travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I'm not as busy as <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> your activities, I have picked basketball, because I love it: I <NS type="R"><i>am a player</i><c>play</c></NS> in a local club and I have been playing for twelve years, so I guess I am a "good" player. I have also chosen photography <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> your list<NS type="RP"><i>: that</i><c>.  That</c></NS> part of California must be beautiful and I would love <NS type="FV"><i>bringing</i><c>to bring</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>home</c></NS> some "well-taken" photos of the area.</p>
<p>I suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to listen</i><c>listen</c></NS> to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> you.</p>
<p>I am writing<NS type="W"><i>, on behalf of an advanced class, to you</i><c> to you on behalf of an advanced class</c></NS> to thank you for having organised our <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> three-day programme <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>from</c></NS> 13th to 15th March.</p>
<p>We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS>, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>see</c></NS> up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students.</p>
<p>On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> intrusion on <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>their</c></NS> privacy. What is more, they insist that <NS type="RT"><i>before</i><c>as well as</c></NS> celebrities, they are also <NS type="UP"><i>human-beings</i><c>human beings</c></NS> who want to live without being disturbed and watched.</p>
<p>In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> covering celebrities. Taking everything <NS type="MT"><c>into</c></NS> account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>put themselves</c></NS> in celebrities' shoes. </p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>In</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>replay</i><c>reply</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize. It was <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> real surprise for me.</p>
<p>I see people who run the camp are very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>organize</i><c>organizing</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> social life of their guests. I have a lot of <NS type="S"><i>posibilities</i><c>possibilities</c></NS> for spending my spare time. The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most. Generally I paint some landscapes by using <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the <NS type="S"><i>impresionist</i><c>impressionist</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>era</c></NS> by using blobs, oil paint and canvases.</p>
<p>The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be <NS type="RV"><i>place</i><c>shown</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> video film about daily life at our school.</p>
<p>Some of the teachers are very good <NS type="UY"><i>just</i></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>profesionalists</i><c>professionals</c></NS>. Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and <NS type="S"><i>funy</i><c>funny</c></NS>. For example, the teacher of history and <NS type="RP"><i>polish</i><c>Polish</c></NS> language is able to interest students <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> the subject in <NS type="IJ"><i>differents</i><c>different</c></NS> ways.</p>
<p>On the whole our school <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> a lot of different possibilities for the students <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> we can show <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> our film. It <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>maks</i><c>make</c></NS> the video more interesting. I recommend <NS type="FV"><i>to show</i><c>showing</c></NS> our <NS type="W"><i>teacher of history</i><c>history teacher</c></NS>. It <NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>will</c></NS> show that during every day we have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>great</c></NS> fun and we <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS></i><c>receive</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> good, important knowledge.</p>
<p>And if this were not enough, I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>got</c></NS> no discount <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as was <NS type="RV"><i>written</i><c>advertised</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Beside</i><c>Besides</c></NS> this, we <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why <NS type="MV"><c>did</c></NS> you make this invitation?</p>
<p>Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster. Beside this you can talk with a person <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the other side of the world <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>via</c></NS> a computer. It is interesting! Furthermore it helps <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>house works</i><c>houseworks</c></NS></i><c>housework</c></NS>, at school and you can travel to places very quickly. So the main advantage of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> our health. A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy. They <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future.</p>
<p>To sum up, there are both <NS type="IJ"><i>positives</i><c>positive</c></NS> and <NS type="IJ"><i>negatives</i><c>negative</c></NS> aspects <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology, because it can <NS type="AGV"><i>makes</i><c>make</c></NS> our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us.</p>
<p>I have received your letter and I would like to reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>as</c></NS> activities. I <NS type="TV"><i>have been belonging</i><c>belonged</c></NS> to a swimming club and I got second prize in a competition last summer. I am good at tennis as well as swimming.</p>
<p>However, shopping sometimes <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> them <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>stressfull</i><c>stressful</c></NS></i><c>stressed</c></NS>. People often waste money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>unvaluable</i><c>worthless</c></NS> things. Then, they really regret it. On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one. In addition, a shop assistant gives them <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> wrong advice.</p>
<p>I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> "Camp California in the USA". I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July. I am finishing my <NS type="FN"><i>study</i><c>studies</c></NS> in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed. I'm not from here (this city), so I wanted to know everything about it: <NS type="UP"><i>it's</i><c>its</c></NS> culture, history and the famous musicals. Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS>. I went to the theatre to see <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> what time <NS type="W"><i>was the show</i><c>the show was</c></NS>, 19.30<NS type="RA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS></i><c>. That</c></NS> was <NS type="UP"><i>O.K.</i><c>OK</c></NS> so I bought a ticket. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that <NS type="TV"><i>mean</i><c>meant</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 <NS type="L"><i>mins</i><c>minutes</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> was a different actor. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that moment I was <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad <NS type="RN"><i>cleaning</i><c>hygiene</c></NS> and food. That was too much. "Dear" manager I hope you <NS type="FV"><i>to understand</i><c>understand</c></NS> me, <NS type="RC"><i>so</i><c>and</c></NS> I ask for money back and I hope this <NS type="MP"><i>wont</i><c>won't</c></NS> happen again. <NS type="SX"><i>By</i><c>Bye</c></NS></p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think we have grown <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> with <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology. It's difficult for us to <NS type="RV"><i>realize</i><c>recognise</c></NS> the changes in our <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS></i><c>lives</c></NS>, but we can think about <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>. How has it <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>changed</c></NS> my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life <NS type="IJ"><i>comfortabler</i><c>more comfortable</c></NS>. Now I only <NS type="RV"><i>used</i><c>need</c></NS> to push a button, and things or <NS type="S"><i>mashines</i><c>machines</c></NS> work on their own. Homework is <NS type="IJ"><i>easer</i><c>easier</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>find</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>cumputer</i><c>computer</c></NS> than <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology <NS type="AGV"><i>go</i><c>goes</c></NS> so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> us <NS type="SX"><i>thing</i><c>think</c></NS> more about <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>our</c></NS> future <NS type="AGN"><i>job</i><c>jobs</c></NS>. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things <NS type="TV"><i>worked</i><c>work</c></NS> and that <NS type="AGV"><i>scare</i><c>scares</c></NS> me<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I will be useless, because a <NS type="S"><i>mashine</i><c>machine</c></NS> will do all the work.</p>
<p>Clothes <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very interesting <NS type="S"><i>subjekt</i><c>subject</c></NS> to study. If you <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>travlling</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>travel</c></NS> around you can see <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> lot of <NS type="DN"><i>different</i><c>difference</c></NS> still <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>between</c></NS> different <NS type="AGN"><i>culture</i><c>cultures</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm writing in order to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>let</c></NS> you know how angry I am <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>after</c></NS> having gone to one of your shows.</p>
<p>What <NS type="UV"><i>have</i></NS> moved me to <NS type="W"><i>this discover</i><c>discover this</c></NS> were the <NS type="RN"><i>facts</i><c>events</c></NS> that happened last month. I had just <NS type="IV"><i>quarreled</i><c>quarrelled</c></NS> with Jon, who is my fiance. <NS type="ID"><i>In that period</i><c>At that time</c></NS> we weren't getting on with <NS type="M"><c>each other</c></NS>. So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> the consequences.</p>
<p>Talking of my work, I <NS type="W"><i>had to mostly</i><c>mostly had two</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>prepare</c></NS> the concert stage with some <NS type="RN">fellows</NS>. If you <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>chose</c></NS> the post, you would be <NS type="W"><i>exhausted <NS type="S"><i>throughlly</i><c>thoroughly</c></NS></i><c>thoroughly exhausted</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby.</p>
<p>During the <NS type="RN"><i>journey</i><c>holiday</c></NS> I would do surfing and photography. I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I <NS type="TV"><i>had gone</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="RP"><i>surfing-course</i><c>surfing course</c></NS> for five years and I won a lot of prizes. I <NS type="W"><i>like also</i><c>also like</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>doing</i></NS> photography because <NS type="R">they can be memories IN my future</NS>.</p>
<p>I particularly liked <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>to know</i><c>to meet</c></NS></i><c>meeting</c></NS> people <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> different countries and some pop-stars, <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> were friendly <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>towards</c></NS> us. I was surprised <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the co-operation that there was <NS type="R">during the job</NS>, because it was <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> a big family, where each member <NS type="TV"><i>helped</i><c>helps</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> others.</p>
<p>As you asked me I will write <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful <NS type="UY"><i>enough</i></NS>. Before the concert I helped <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>carring</i><c>carrying</c></NS> and putting in order some chairs on which <NS type="W"><i>would sit some special <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS></i><c>some special people would sit</c></NS>. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="CN"><i>drinkings</i><c>drinking</c></NS></i><c>drinks</c></NS> to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.</p>
<p>I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I <NS type="TV"><i>am playing</i><c>play</c></NS> at least <NS type="R"><i>at the</i><c>every</c></NS> weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> animals.</p>
<p>Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful <NS type="AGN"><i>experience</i><c>experiences</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life, but the <NS type="W"><i>concert day</i><c>day of the concert</c></NS> was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event.</p>
<p>I was <NS type="RY"><i>first</i><c>at first</c></NS>, very excited to <NS type="TV"><i>see</i><c>be seeing</c></NS> the show, because <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> have a perfect evening <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening.</p>
<p>I went to see my favourite actor<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Danny Brook<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started <NS type="FY"><i>late</i><c>later</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> I expected. It should <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>run</c></NS> from <NS type="RP"><i>7,30</i><c>7.30</c></NS> p.m<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>, but it <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> 8.15 p.m.!</p>
<p>I want to complain about the ticket. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the advertisement it said that discounts <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>availble</i><c>available</c></NS>, but when I asked a <NS type="IN"><i>staff</i><c>member of staff</c></NS> in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed <NS type="FY"><i>early</i><c>earlier</c></NS> than usual. I think they should <NS type="R">keep the times correctly</NS>.</p>
<p>Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes<NS type="RP"><i>. Like</i><c>, like</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>wearing</i></NS> T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc. They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes<NS type="RP"><i>. Like</i><c>, like</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>earings</i><c>earrings</c></NS>, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, <NS type="RP"><i>hairbands</i><c>hair bands</c></NS>, <NS type="RP"><i>hand bags</i><c>handbags</c></NS>, shoes, watches, etc. They like <NS type="IJ"><i>designers</i><c>designer</c></NS> clothes and everyone <NS type="AGV"><i>wear</i><c>wears</c></NS> different modern clothes <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>in terms of</c></NS> size, <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> colour and <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>shapes</i><c>shape</c></NS>.</p>
<p>For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will <NS type="W"><i>be not</i><c>not be</c></NS> dangerous. If we use <NS type="UY"><i>up</i></NS> carbon dioxide <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about <NS type="R">Ozone breaking</NS>. This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> future. It <NS type="TV"><i>is to save</i><c>will save</c></NS> our Earth.</p>
<p>On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical "Over the Rainbow" <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the "Circle <NS type="SA"><i>Theater</i><c>Theatre</c></NS>". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the <NS type="RN"><i>points</i><c>reasons</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>because</i><c>why</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>appear</c></NS>! So when the miserable musical came to <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>its</c></NS> end, we were happy to leave the <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>room</i><c>auditorium</c></NS>, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no <NS type="IN"><i>restaurantes</i><c>restaurants</c></NS> were <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just <NS type="MV"><c>found</c></NS> a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a <NS type="RJ"><i>short</i><c>small</c></NS> sign on a door: "Sorry, we are closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> renovations"! We thought it <NS type="UV"><i>would</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>was</c></NS> a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS>. I would prefer <NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>to get</c></NS> my money back, instead of <NS type="RV"><i>taking</i><c>getting</c></NS> a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> day on<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> he <NS type="TV"><i>knows</i><c>knew</c></NS> anything about our secret we <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> live in danger <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> being caught. We, that <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>is</c></NS> Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Hedwiga<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we <NS type="TV"><i>won't</i><c>wouldn't</c></NS> attack them. We had this idea first<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was <NS type="ID"><i>love of first slight</i><c>love at first sight</c></NS> and we were fascinated by the thought<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> building <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>kind of the same</i><c>the same kind of</c></NS> organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had <NS type="S"><i>heaed</i><c>heard</c></NS> of some people paying, "<NS type="S"><i>safty-money</i><c>safety-money</c></NS>", but never know the reason, until he found a <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>large</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>amout</i><c>amount</c></NS> of money in my room. His <NS type="ID"><i>thoughts combined</i><c>mind made up</c></NS> and ready to go to the police he <NS type="RV"><i>went out of</i><c>left</c></NS> our house, where me and my <NS type="L"><i>homies</i><c>friends</c></NS> were just hanging <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="S"><i>aroud</i><c>around</c></NS></i><c>out</c></NS>. He saw me and <NS type="IV"><i>tolled</i><c>told</c></NS> me <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> my face<NS type="MP"><i> you</i><c>, "You</c></NS> are a thief and a burglar and I will <NS type="W"><i>go now</i><c>now go</c></NS> to the police<NS type="MP"><i>,</i><c>."</c></NS> I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah <NS type="S"><i>fokes</i><c>folks</c></NS>, that was the point I got <NS type="S"><i>interupted</i><c>interrupted</c></NS> by my parents in this beautiful dream, but <NS type="RC"><i>when</i><c>if</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>will</i><c>want</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>hear</i><c>to hear</c></NS> the end of my story than buy the "Rossall-School-<NS type="S"><i>magazin</i><c>magazine</c></NS>", <NS type="SX"><i>net</i><c>next</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>time again</i><c>issue</c></NS>, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to ask you <NS type="S"><i>wheather</i><c>whether</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>there is</c></NS> anything I should bring <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> such as specific clothes, extra money etc.</p>
<p>First of all, I'd like to travel only in July because I'm supposed to be a volunteer <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Music festival, held in August.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The</i></NS> 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active. Additionally, 15% of students answered <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> they want the presentation lesson to be filmed. The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> presentation does his or her best.</p>
<p>The soccer game, played every Monday, was ranked <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>as</c></NS> the most <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS></i><c>popular</c></NS> activity by 45% <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> students. They said the soccer game <NS type="AGV"><i>enable</i><c>enables</c></NS> them to get together and have fun. However, the <NS type="L"><i>girls'd</i><c>girls would</c></NS> rather play table tennis or badminton. <NS type="DJ">Hicking</NS> activity was chosen by 20% <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> students, followed by the soccer.</p>
<p>So, we can change your programme a little bit <NS type="R">to the best one</NS>. On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your programme. On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the <NS type="RP"><i>national art gallery</i><c>National Art Gallery</c></NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I <NS type="S"><i>belived</i><c>believed</c></NS> everything she <NS type="TV"><i>has told</i><c>told</c></NS> me. And said just <NS type="FV"><i>to be</i><c>be</c></NS> careful. But <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> three days she <NS type="RV"><i>hasn't been at</i><c>didn't come</c></NS> home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait. But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>After</c></NS> three days of <NS type="R">her disappearing</NS> the phone <NS type="TV"><i>has rung</i><c>rang</c></NS>. I <NS type="RV"><i>took</i><c>picked up</c></NS> the phone. Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> 5000$ and <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>up</i><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>onto</c></NS> the street. I took <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>papers</i><c>paper</c></NS>, put <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS> bag and without saying anything went to my friend to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> something <NS type="M"><c>that looked</c></NS> like <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> gun. The friend gave me his toy <NS type="MN"><c>gun</c></NS> and I <NS type="TV"><i>gone</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>onto</c></NS> the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I had a gun and money. I <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> surprised that he <NS type="S"><i>belived</i><c>believed</c></NS> me. Of course, it was better for us. I gave him the bag<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> took <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>friends</i><c>friend's</c></NS> hand and we <NS type="TV"><i>run</i><c>ran</c></NS> away. After that she told me<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that the man was the boy<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> she <NS type="TV"><i>met</i><c>had met</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It was so great to hear that I had won first prize. It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp. I am writing to reply <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>to</c></NS> your questions.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the Camp in July, if <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> possible. This is just one <NS type="AGN"><i>months</i><c>month</c></NS> which <NS type="RV"><i>I've</i><c>I have</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>fee</i><c>free</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Another sport which I'd like to do is swimming. <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> swimming I'm not as good</i><c>I'm not as good at swimming</c></NS> as <NS type="M"><c>I am</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> basketball, but I'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it.</p>
<p>How are you? I'm fine. I'm so <NS type="SX"><i>exited</i><c>excited</c></NS>. Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine. It was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Tina Turner concert! <NS type="RT"><i>To</i><c>At</c></NS> this moment when <NS type="TV"><i>I'm thinking</i><c>I think</c></NS> of it I want <NS type="FV"><i>shout</i><c>to shout</c></NS>.</p>
<p>According to your letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I have two options <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>regarding</c></NS> accommodation, <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>either</c></NS> in tents or log cabins. I would prefer <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I <NS type="TV"><i>never stayed</i><c>have never stayed</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> in the middle of nowhere<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, on</i><c>.  On</c></NS> the other hand I think that I will be able to "survive" in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>. Looking <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> your letter, I can see many options <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> activities and I <NS type="TV"><i>realized</i><c>realize</c></NS> that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> choosing <NS type="AGQ"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> two activities is that they contrast <NS type="MC"><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>itselves</i><c>themselves</c></NS></i><c>each other</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I want one <NS type="M"><c>that is</c></NS> more exciting and that asks for more agility and another <NS type="M"><c>that is</c></NS> <NS type="IJ"><i>more calm</i><c>calmer</c></NS> and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS>, however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>wish</i><c>hope</c></NS> that I can learn about it <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good <NS type="R"><i>doing</i><c>at</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>There was a concert <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> a famous band here in my city. I <NS type="S"><i>vish</i><c>wish</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>had been</c></NS> here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the <NS type="RP"><i>fan's</i><c>fans'</c></NS> bus. Yes, there is a bus that <NS type="AGV"><i>take</i><c>takes</c></NS> you to the concert and <NS type="AGV"><i>bring</i><c>brings</c></NS> you back.</p>
<p>AT 20:00, we stopped <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a coffee house to eat. <NS type="SX"><i>The</i><c>They</c></NS> shouted: "20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave."</p>
<p>We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> much. After a few minutes (I <NS type="RV"><i>fought</i><c>thought</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>they</c></NS> were <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes <NS type="MY"><c>before</c></NS>. The man offered <NS type="MA"><c>us</c></NS> a ride. We <NS type="TV"><i>accept</i><c>accepted</c></NS>. You <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> imagine how <NS type="S"><i>dissapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> with <NS type="DA"><i>my ownself</i><c>myself</c></NS>.</p>
<p>We started to put <NS type="S"><i>everthing</i><c>everything</c></NS> on the stage and after this we realized that the band was <NS type="RV"><i>entering</i><c>coming</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>onto</c></NS> the stage near us.</p>
<p><NS type="W"><i>By my side the <NS type="DN"><i>vocal</i><c>vocalist</c></NS> of the Almendegos was</i><c>The vocalist of the Almendegos was by my side</c></NS> and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> the best place, near <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> the stage and <NS type="R"><i>after</i><c>afterwards</c></NS>, the thing that I most liked, we were <NS type="DV"><i>convidated</i><c>invited</c></NS> to see the group and <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>got</c></NS> their signatures.</p>
<p>Science and technology can give us a better <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS> style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS> or better food. For example, <NS type="RT"><i>before</i><c>once</c></NS> people <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> to walk from <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>one</c></NS> place to <NS type="R"><i>the other</i><c>another</c></NS>, but now we can use <NS type="S"><i>sciene</i><c>science</c></NS> and technology to produce a lot of <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="RN"><i>petrel</i><c>petrol</c></NS></i><c>petrol-powered</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>transport</i><c>vehicles</c></NS> and we can <NS type="RV"><i>transport</i><c>travel</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>with them faster</i><c>faster with them</c></NS>. We <NS type="W"><i>also can</i><c>can also</c></NS> produce more and better food <NS type="R"><i>or</i><c>by</c></NS> using science and technology<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> e.g. <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>using</c></NS> science to put all the good <NS type="AGN"><i>part</i><c>parts</c></NS> of two plants into one plant. We can also use <NS type="S"><i>techlogy</i><c>technology</c></NS> to produce more food and help them grow faster.</p>
<p>Science and technology can also <NS type="TV"><i>used</i><c>be used</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to produce</c></NS> some <NS type="FN"><i>material</i><c>materials</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> e.g. steel or iron, which <NS type="TV"><i>use</i><c>are used</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> our <NS type="FN"><i>building</i><c>buildings</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS></i><c>. They</c></NS> can make <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> stronger and <NS type="X"><i>not easy</i><c>hard</c></NS> to destroy.</p>
<p>Also, you wrote about discounts, but <NS type="TV"><i>it's</i><c>it was</c></NS> not true! The woman<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> who sold <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> a ticket was very <NS type="S"><i>roud</i><c>rude</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> me, actually she started swearing at me.</p>
<p>Two days later<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the morning, <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> policeman came to <NS type="MV"><c>see</c></NS> Peter... So, now my best friend is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> prisoner. All the time<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> prison <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> 5 years. By the way<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>don't</i><c>haven't</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>see</i><c>seen</c></NS> Pat <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> about one year. Perhaps, he moved <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> another town. It's good that he <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny...</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>MY</i><c>My</c></NS> daily life<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>:</c></NS> I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do.

<p>Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a normal day, but when I sit and think, <NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS> everywhere!</p>
<p>For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at <NS type="SX"><i>last</i><c>least</c></NS>!</p>
<p>A wonderful example <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> modern technology: <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Computer</i><c>computer</c></NS>! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people.</p>
<p>In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even <NS type="IV"><i>varys</i><c>varies</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>depending on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people whom you shop with.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you to make <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>complaints</i><c>complaint</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre.</p>
<p>I can't remember waking up <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>without</c></NS> the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee. Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> I consider <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>to be</c></NS> the most important influence technology <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>has had</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my life: the computer and Internet.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the beginning of the month.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="RT"><i>in the name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> the whole class. First of <NS type="S"><i>al</i><c>all</c></NS>, I want to thank you for the interesting programme<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which you <NS type="W"><i>already have</i><c>have already</c></NS> organised. It is very good, especially the <NS type="RP"><i>Sightseeing</i><c>sightseeing</c></NS> tour by bus.</p>
<p>However, we <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London. There we <NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>will be able to</c></NS> see everything <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>connected with</c></NS> the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles. <NS type="UD"><i>The <NS type="RN"><i>entrance</i><c>entry</c></NS></i><c>Entry</c></NS> for <NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> is free.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity because as you know most people <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our class are going to work in this sector so it <NS type="TV"><i>will be</i><c>would be</c></NS> very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education.</p>
<p>For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if you look back <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the forties and compare <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>home</i><c>homes</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS> with nowadays<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you can see that <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> become more modern, especially the <NS type="RN"><i>facilities</i><c>equipment</c></NS> in the kitchen and in the <NS type="RP"><i>livingroom</i><c>living room</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>in</i><c>In</c></NS> the future it <NS type="R"><i>could be</i><c>is possible</c></NS> that you <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>won't</c></NS> have to prepare your breakfast <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>your</i><c>yourself</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>own</i></NS>, perhaps you <NS type="TV"><i>just have</i><c>will just have</c></NS> to press a button when your alarm clock has gone <NS type="MY"><c>off</c></NS>. In addition to this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you may have some <NS type="DN"><i>roboters</i><c>robots</c></NS> bringing the newspaper <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the table, tidying up the house, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> doing the shopping<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>and maybe</i><c>Maybe</c></NS> they <NS type="TV"><i>are also</i><c>will also be</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>living</i><c>life</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>patners</i><c>partners</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In general we can <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>see</c></NS> the huge <NS type="FN"><i>change</i><c>changes</c></NS> we <NS type="TV"><i>already had</i><c>have already had</c></NS>, but who knows exactly what the future will bring <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> us?</p>
<p>One of the <NS type="IJ"><i>biggist</i><c>biggest</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> changed is <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> change in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>method</i><c>methods</c></NS> of <NS type="FN"><i>communications</i><c>communication</c></NS>. People have invented such things <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us <NS type="DJ"><i>enable</i><c>able</c></NS> to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily.</p>
<p>I have mentioned <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few changes above but there's still <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="IJ"><i>biggist</i><c>biggest</c></NS> one left<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>related to</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>computer areas</i><c>the field of computers</c></NS>. It helped us to be able to work much <NS type="IY"><i>more quicker</i><c>more quickly</c></NS> and accurately than before with the help of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet.</p>
<p>The idea of making the festival "international" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls <NS type="FV"><i>were</i><c>being</c></NS> too small. <NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Plays</i><c>plays</c></NS> and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I <NS type="RV"><i>joined</i><c>attended</c></NS> the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> sight for our <NS type="RJ"><i>sour</i><c>sore</c></NS> eyes<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, <NS type="MT"><c>not to mention</c></NS> their <NS type="RP"><i>life styles</i><c>lifestyles</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> by talking to them. <NS type="RT"><i>Beyond</i><c>In addition to</c></NS> all <NS type="RA"><i>these</i><c>that</c></NS>, the <NS type="RN"><i>application</i><c>idea</c></NS> of joining <NS type="MY"><c>in</c></NS> all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> activities <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> one <NS type="UP"><i>nice-priced</i><c><NS type="RY"><i><NS type="DY"><i>nice</i><c>nicely</c></NS></i><c>reasonably</c></NS> priced</c></NS> ticket was excellent<NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> because it saved you from <NS type="MV"><c>having</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>buying</i><c>to buy</c></NS> one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and <NS type="R"><i>others</i><c>other things</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect.</p>
<p>The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very <NS type="S"><i>diciplined</i><c>disciplined</c></NS>, especially about our clothes and <NS type="FN"><i>behaviours</i><c>behaviour</c></NS>. I understand the second part, but I can't <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>understand</c></NS> the reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>wearing <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> white <NS type="SX"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> dark blue only</i><c>only wearing white and dark blue</c></NS>. Do we become the "perfect one" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much <NS type="IJ"><i>more free</i><c>freer</c></NS> at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>wonder</i><c>want</c></NS> to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the trip.</p>
<p>My job was very easy<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I had to help Sting <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> everything, for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if he wanted water, I had to give <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> him water<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was marvellous. He was very kind to me<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> talked <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> dinner<NS type="RP"><i>, yes</i><c>. Yes,</c></NS> I know what you're thinking, "Dinner and Sting"<NS type="MP"><i> yes</i><c>. Yes,</c></NS> my friend<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was the best thing <NS type="M"><c>to happen to me</c></NS> in my life. I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I <NS type="TV"><i>spoken</i><c>spoke</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>very well English</i><c>English very well</c></NS>. The best thing was I spoke in English <NS type="R">because I was forgetting it</NS> and I met my favourite singer.</p>
<p>To sum up I would like to say that for me <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is very difficult <NS type="MV"><c>to decide</c></NS> which group <NS type="RV"><i>has the reason</i><c>is right</c></NS> but, <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>for</c></NS> the moment, we should try to respect each other and <NS type="R">go in the other's soul to feel like them in those moments we cannot understand them</NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Among</i><c>From</c></NS> the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - <NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS>and Photography - <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> which I know just the <NS type="DJ"><i>basical</i><c>basic</c></NS> skills.</p>
<p>With the <NS type="DN"><i>increasing</i><c>increase</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres.</p>
<p>First, most <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>part</i><c>parts</c></NS></i><c>areas</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>shoping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> centres <NS type="AGV"><i>uses</i><c>use</c></NS> artificial illumination and <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>refiguration</i><c>refrigeration</c></NS></i><c>air conditioning</c></NS>, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring.</p>
<p>Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that <NS type="S"><i>consumism</i><c>consumerism</c></NS> may develop <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> a compulsion. There are cases of people that <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> spend one day without buying anything.</p>
<p>In the advertisement there's no mention <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>some</c></NS> back to me.</p>
<p>Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the southern <NS type="RN"><i>cost</i><c>coast</c></NS> of Spain with my friend Pat.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>As</c></NS> it was so beautiful, we decided to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> back to the beach at night to see the moon, the <NS type="SX"><i>see</i><c>sea</c></NS> and the stars.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS> doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the end, we saw that they had <NS type="RV"><i>robbed</i><c>stolen</c></NS> a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't <NS type="AS"><i>tell it to anybody</i><c>tell anybody about it</c></NS>. It was our secret.</p>
<p>Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were <NS type="TV"><i>being told</i><c>told</c></NS> but it started <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>after</c></NS> a delay of 45 minutes. Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> renovation.</p>
<p>Finally there were no discounts available <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets. All the above made my night terribly disappointing and I must say that the advertisement is nothing but a business fraud, so I'm in the unpleasant position <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to ask</i><c>asking</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> my money back. I'm looking forward to your reply<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Technology is an essential part <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> people's <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>. It's something <NS type="S"><i>absoletuly</i><c>absolutely</c></NS> necessary for every action people <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>does</i><c>do</c></NS></i><c>perform</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> It <NS type="SX"><i>effects</i><c>affects</c></NS> us both <NS type="DY"><i>positive</i><c>positively</c></NS> and <NS type="DY"><i>negative</i><c>negatively</c></NS>. It's a part of our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS>. Firstly technology has created a bond between myself and my computer. <NS type="TV"><i>I got</i><c>I've got</c></NS> used to spending 2-3 hours in front of the computer. My relationship with my family and friends doesn't even exist. I've <NS type="TV"><i>end</i><c>ended</c></NS> up being a <NS type="UP"><i>T.V</i><c>TV</c></NS> addict<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Despite the negative effects, technology can <NS type="SX"><i>effect</i><c>affect</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> a positive way a person's life</i><c>a person's life in a positive way</c></NS>. <NS type="DN"><i>Air conditions</i><c>Air conditioning</c></NS>, watches, computers, and many other things have made my life easier. There's no need <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> to the shops when I can order things <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>on</c></NS> the computer. <NS type="DN"><i>Air conditions</i><c>Air conditioning</c></NS> also makes my life easier<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>I'm writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="R"><i>representing</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> all the <NS type="RP"><i>english</i><c>English</c></NS> class in order to let you know how <NS type="RJ"><i>exciting</i><c>excited</c></NS> we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>interresting</i><c>interesting</c></NS></i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> doing in London while we're there.</p>
<p>I arrived in Paris <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> New <NS type="MP"><i>Years</i><c>Year's</c></NS> Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a <NS type="RJ"><i>little</i><c>small</c></NS> amount of money. But <NS type="R"><i><NS type="RP"><i>eventhough</i><c>even though</c></NS></i><c>in spite of</c></NS> all of these <NS type="S"><i>desadventages</i><c>disadvantages</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>above</i></NS>, I was <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>folling</i><c>following</c></NS></i><c>pursuing</c></NS> my dreams and objectives and <NS type="RP"><i>inspite</i><c>in spite</c></NS> of everything I was going to do it.</p>
<p>So suddenly, a week later I found <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>myself</c></NS> a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke <NS type="RP"><i>french</i><c>French</c></NS> at that <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>time</c></NS>. It took me three months to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>overcame</i><c>overcome</c></NS></i><c>learn</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>languages</i><c>language</c></NS> and <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>by</c></NS> this time the whole <NS type="S"><i>familly</i><c>family</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>falled</i><c>fell</c></NS></i><c>had fallen</c></NS> in love with me, <NS type="MY"><c>so</c></NS> that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the <NS type="S"><i>familly</i><c>family</c></NS>, <NS type="RP"><i>eventhough</i><c>even though</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> was very hard at the <NS type="S"><i>beggining</i><c>beginning</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On the other hand</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us. When there was <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>restful</i><c>intermission</c></NS> we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late. We couldn't have a drink. Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back because <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> some things that we <NS type="RV"><i>hadn't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> in the theatre.</p>
<p>We have more researchers than <NS type="RQ"><i>some</i><c>a few</c></NS> years ago and we will be able to find the solution <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> lots of problems. Actually, we can cure <NS type="AGN"><i>illness</i><c>illnesses</c></NS> which were <NS type="RY"><i>very dangerous before</i><c>once very dangerous</c></NS>. I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see <NS type="W"><i>cured some <NS type="AGN"><i>illness</i><c>illnesses</c></NS> like cancer<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> UTH</i><c>some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>Thesedays</i><c>These days</c></NS> we are living <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> a high-technology world. Modern technology has been <NS type="RV"><i>growing</i><c>advancing</c></NS> rapidly and it has <NS type="RV"><i>effected</i><c>affected</c></NS> me a lot. Indeed, I have to save more money <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>upgrading</i><c>to upgrade</c></NS> my personal computer. Computer technology keeps improving all the time and <NS type="DN"><i>consumes</i><c>consumers</c></NS> like <NS type="L"><i>me and you</i><c>you and me</c></NS> definitely have to <NS type="RV"><i>pay</i><c>spend</c></NS> our money to keep our personal computer up to date and <NS type="RJ"><i>able</i><c>capable of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to work</i><c>working</c></NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> new computer <NS type="CN"><i>softwares</i><c>software</c></NS> that <NS type="AGV"><i>require</i><c>requires</c></NS> more and more <NS type="R">performance of computer hardware</NS>.</p>
<p>I shall have a look <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>at</c></NS> the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.</p>
<p>How much effort and time it took about two decades <NS type="SX"><i>go</i><c>ago</c></NS> to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can <NS type="W"><i>make even</i><c>even make</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>have made</c></NS> our life easier <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> old fridges had to be <NS type="DV"><i>defreezed to melt out</i><c>defrosted</c></NS> and new fridges use <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> different kind of cooling <NS type="MN"><c>system</c></NS> and will tell you if <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>have forgotten</c></NS> to close the door! The modern cooker will turn <NS type="W"><i>off itself</i><c>itself off</c></NS> if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> devices modern technology offers us.</p>
<p>This show will <NS type="FV"><i>be taken</i><c>take</c></NS> place at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>between</c></NS> 10.00 - 19.00, <NS type="R">which</NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>include</i><c>includes</c></NS> the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles.</p>
<p>So, that afternoon <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>lunch time</i><c>lunchtime</c></NS>, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out <NS type="S"><i>quitely</i><c>quietly</c></NS> and calmly. Finally, I was <NS type="DY"><i>succeed</i><c>successful</c></NS> in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it <NS type="UY"><i>back</i></NS> without anyone <NS type="FV"><i>saw</i><c>seeing</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his <NS type="SX"><i>hole</i><c>whole</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>schoole</i><c>school</c></NS> knew <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> Sara's experience.</p>
<p>One day she had to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> the shopping for her mother. She had to buy a <NS type="UP"><i>lottery-ticket</i><c>lottery ticket</c></NS> and other things for her. After she had done this she went home, but she didn't buy the ticket because she thought there <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>aren't</i><c>isn't</c></NS></i><c>wasn't</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>no</i><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>chance</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to win</i><c>winning</c></NS>. She spent <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>money</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>only</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>magazin</i><c>magazine</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After she came home her mother was sitting in front of the TV and looked <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="UP"><i>lottery-numbers</i><c>lottery numbers</c></NS>. Suddenly she jumped out of her armchair and shouted: "I have won the <NS type="UP"><i>jack-pot</i><c>jackpot</c></NS>". Sara was out of breath and after <NS type="M"></NS> she <NS type="TV"><i>had told</i><c>told</c></NS> her mother<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> she hadn't bought the ticket. Her mother <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> angry but some hours later she was friendly again.</p>
<p>Sara couldn't understand the fact<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that she didn't do the right thing. She had <NS type="RV"><i>earn</i><c>lost</c></NS> a lot of money, so she would be more careful <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> doing things <NS type="M"></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you <NS type="S"><i>whed</i><c>that</c></NS> the idea was great and I hope that <NS type="CE">so needful for people events</NS> <NS type="TV"><i>would become</i><c>will become</c></NS> a good tradition in our country. I think that providing such festivals could help people to be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the centre of cultural life of the world and to have enough information about <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> new <NS type="DJ"><i>art</i><c>artistic</c></NS> styles<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>But I hope that next year <NS type="S"><i>visitores</i><c>visitors</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> festival <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>will be</c></NS> able to <NS type="TV"><i>introduce</i><c>be introduced</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> more art groups from all over the world. I suggest it would be very <NS type="S"><i>intresting</i><c>interesting</c></NS> to meet artists from <NS type="RJ"><i>far</i><c>faraway</c></NS> and exotic countries.</p>
<p>Also, if I were you I would make your concert halls a bit larger, because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>very</c></NS> many people would like to spend their holidays with their families <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> your festival next year<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>All <NS type="AGD"><i>that</i><c>those</c></NS> discos, concerts, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>touristic</i><c>tourist</c></NS> trips have to be paid <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> different <NS type="FN"><i>sum</i><c>sums</c></NS> of those small coloured pieces of paper<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> called money</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Most</i><c>The most</c></NS> common way to earn <NS type="MN"><c>money</c></NS> is <NS type="UP"><i>baby-sitting</i><c>babysitting</c></NS>. Many young people earn their pocket money <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>in this way</c></NS>, helping <NS type="R"><i>neighbouring parents</i><c>parents in the neighbourhood</c></NS> to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, <NS type="R"><i>make <NS type="S"><i>promontion</i><c>promotion</c></NS> of</i><c>sell</c></NS> different goods or even <NS type="MV"><c>work</c></NS> as <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>bouncer</i><c>bouncers</c></NS>. Naturally, it's easier to get a job <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>when</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> foreign <NS type="S"><i>languagers</i><c>languages</c></NS> or computers. <NS type="SX"><i>When</i><c>Then</c></NS> you can find yourself <NS type="MN"><c>work</c></NS> as a tourist guide or as a secretary.</p>
<p>The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>should</c></NS> be some improvements to make this festival better.</p>
<p>Firstly, there were stars and artists <NS type="W"><i>only from</i><c>from only</c></NS> six countries. This number <NS type="RV"><i>may</i><c>should</c></NS> be increased to attract more and different people. Also some <NS type="FN"><i>concerts</i><c>concert</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>holls</i><c>halls</c></NS> were too small for this <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> very successful <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>at</c></NS> finding good stars.</p>
<p><NS type="AS"><i>The films and plays were not <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> many</i><c>there were not very many films and plays</c></NS>. As a result of this <NS type="AS"><i>the kinds of films were not enough</i><c>there were not enough kinds of films</c></NS>. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>all</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of people.</p>
<p><NS type="TV"><i>I'm</i><c>I was</c></NS> so glad to receive your <NS type="RJ"><i>lost</i><c>last</c></NS> letter because <NS type="TV"><i>I've started</i><c>I'd started</c></NS> to think that you were angry <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> me for not writing for a long time. I promise I'll write more<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>The school rules are horrible here. We are restricted <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>doing</c></NS> nearly everything. The school is like a <NS type="S"><i>dungeen</i><c>dungeon</c></NS> here. I don't <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>want</c></NS> to be so <NS type="S"><i>evel</i><c>evil</c></NS> about school but <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> rules are rules and they are limiting us <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>within</c></NS> the borders of our school.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The modern</i><c>Modern</c></NS> technology like <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways. The <NS type="AGN"><i>advantages</i><c>advantage</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> that I can do all my shopping <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. I don't have to <NS type="RV"><i>stress</i><c>mess</c></NS> around in the supermarket <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="RP"><i>friday</i><c>Friday</c></NS> evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the <NS type="S"><i>groseries</i><c>groceries</c></NS> I need delivered to my door<NS type="UP"><i>.

I buy all my clothes on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> as well and it works <NS type="DY"><i>brilliant</i><c>brilliantly</c></NS>, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> too. I don't get as much exercise as I used to get. <NS type="S"><i>Nowdays</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS> I spend 2 hours <NS type="R"><i>intent</i><c>in front</c></NS> of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people. I have got friends over the whole world now. I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my <NS type="RP"><i>internetfriends</i><c>Internet friends</c></NS>. <NS type="UD"><i>The modern</i><c>Modern</c></NS> technology <NS type="AGV"><i>open</i><c>opens</c></NS> new and exciting ways for us. I don't think that I <NS type="RV"><i>had been</i><c>would be</c></NS> going to Japan if it wasn't <NS type="R"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. <NS type="MD"><i>Internet</i><c>The Internet</c></NS> has opened <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> a whole new world <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but <NS type="RY"><i>even though</i><c>still</c></NS> I would like to know how much money <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> I have to take with me. I would <NS type="R">be glad</NS> to travel only in July <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> family reasons. <NS type="RQ"><i>Other</i><c>Another</c></NS> point is accommodation. I would be more than happy if you could <NS type="FV"><i>have provided</i><c>provide</c></NS> me with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent. The reasons <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>are the</c></NS> following<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>:</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>a tent promotes a</c></NS> better relationship with nature, and <NS type="M"><c>is a</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>grate</i><c>great</c></NS> opportunity to improve my health.</p>
<p>Money is a very important thing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> shopping<NS type="RP"><i>, if</i><c>. If</c></NS> you have money, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's <NS type="S"><i>imagen</i><c>imagine</c></NS> that your credit card is not working, or some one <NS type="IV"><i>stold</i><c>stole</c></NS> your cash from your pocket. We will say <NS type="M"><c>you're</c></NS> unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are <NS type="DJ"><i>handicapt</i><c>handicapped</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show "Over the Rainbow," <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> I attended <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset <NS type="MC"><c>as</c></NS> when I realized that the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> expected famous actor</i><c>famous actor I expected</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Danny Brook, <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>would</c></NS> not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further <NS type="AGN"><i>inaccuracy</i><c>inaccuracies</c></NS>; this <NS type="RN"><i>entertainment</i><c>show</c></NS> did not <NS type="S"><i>sart</i><c>start</c></NS> at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. <NS type="RP"><i>More over</i><c>Moreover</c></NS>, I was looking forward to getting a <NS type="RN"><i>reduction</i><c>discount</c></NS> on the <NS type="RN"><i>pricing</i><c>price</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>of the ticket</c></NS> as<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> indicated <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your adverts, but <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>that</c></NS>, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it <NS type="MC"><c>so</c></NS> happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. "A Perfect evening out"!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not <NS type="S"><i>fullfil</i><c>fulfil</c></NS> its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> £15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully</p>
<p>A couple of weeks later, my sister called me <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>when</c></NS> I was at work; completely devastated and <NS type="S"><i>weaping</i><c>weeping</c></NS> scalding tears, she could<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving <NS type="RT"><i>over</i><c>by</c></NS> herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then, <NS type="R">feel her,</NS> upset as ever. I could get her <NS type="U"><i>as well</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>simmer</i><c>to simmer</c></NS> for a second or two then she suddenly <NS type="S"><i>sarted</i><c>started</c></NS> shouting uncontrollably: - "Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat", <NS type="W"><i>hurled Olga</i><c>Olga hurled</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> at me<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>down</c></NS> the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the "poor cow"!</p>
<p>I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the letter.</p>
<p>I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I just started my new job and I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>have</c></NS> one month of <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> holiday, which <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July.</p>
<p>You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can <NS type="DV"><i>choice</i><c>choose</c></NS>. I'm quite good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>paiting</i><c>painting</c></NS> and I play tennis. I'll be very happy <NS type="RC"><i>when</i><c>if</c></NS> you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="S"><i>paiting's</i><c>painting's</c></NS></i><c>painting</c></NS> materials like oil paints<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> canvas and <NS type="S"><i>bruches</i><c>brushes</c></NS> for me. The size of the canvas isn't so important.</p>
<p>Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> you have <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this time of the year.</p>
<p>Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite <NS type="RP"><i>polish</i><c>Polish</c></NS> group "THE CULT" in Warshaw. I had the chance to help at the concert. You can't imagine how happy I was. I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot. You know I'm good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>mace-up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and I have done <NS type="W"><i>many times scenography</i><c>scenography many times</c></NS>. They were pleased that I can do two of <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>job</i><c>jobs</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that's why I got the <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>job</c></NS>. I was working like crazy but I enjoyed <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> a lot. I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>gave</c></NS> the concert.</p>
<p>After that I prepared the group. I <NS type="TV"><i>done</i><c>did</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>mace-up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> for them. I was very happy because <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> this time I had a chance <NS type="FV"><i>talking</i><c>to talk</c></NS> to them and to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>find out</c></NS> more about them. They are very nice people<NS type="MP"><i> even</i><c>. Even</c></NS> Audrey who seems very stupid. She is very intelligent. I really don't know why she <NS type="AGV"><i>behave</i><c>behaves</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>herself</i></NS> so badly during her interview. I got their address so we can visit them one day.</p>
<p>I'm writing to <NS type="RP"><i>You</i><c>you</c></NS> in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS>. I also hope<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it "international" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (<NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>said</c></NS> to be "from around the world") were from only six countries. Maybe the <NS type="S"><i>eason</i><c>reason</c></NS> for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones.</p>
<p>I am really excited to travel <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> Camp California in the USA because I like to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>get to know</c></NS> people <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> other countries.</p>
<p>As I only have holidays <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> this month.</p>
<p>I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> Ireland on <NS type="RP"><i>2th</i><c>2nd</c></NS> July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to <NS type="SX"><i>built</i><c>build</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>scenary</i><c>scenery</c></NS> and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>irish</i><c>Irish</c></NS> music and suddenly we saw <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us.</p>
<p>I am writing in order to express my disappointment <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> your musical show "Over the Rainbow".</p>
<p>I <NS type="IV"><i>saws</i><c>saw</c></NS> the show's advertisement hanging up <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends. I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good <NS type="RN"><i>references</i><c>reviews</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> your Company and, above all, <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>because of</c></NS> the main star, Danny Brook.</p>
<p>The problems started <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last Wednesday Carole received a letter. The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters. She didn't recognize the writing. She began to read<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "Dear Carolin..<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> There was only <NS type="RQ"><i>a</i><c>one</c></NS> person who used to call her by this name. It brought a lot of memories back to her. It was long time ago, when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen. He was her first love and also the first who kissed her. Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father's work. When they were saying goodbye Paul <NS type="MV"><c>said</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "I will be the last person who will kiss you". "It sounds nice but I don't believe it<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS>" she replied. "You only have to wait<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS>" he said. But she didn't wait. She got married and had two children. <NS type="ID"><i>At this moment</i><c>At the time</c></NS> Carole was living with her husband but they didn't love each other any more. Their love had finished. In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again. Her friend Pat had explained the whole story <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> her husband. What <NS type="W"><i>she would</i><c>would she</c></NS> do?</p>
<p>One of the most important <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="SX"><i>think</i><c>thing</c></NS></i><c>things</c></NS> we have to film is our <NS type="S"><i>bycicle</i><c>bicycle</c></NS> classes<NS type="RP"><i>, our</i><c>. Our</c></NS> school is now the best <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the country in all ages<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> We are <NS type="DJ">prest</NS> with this<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> can show what we do in order to be the best. If it <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>sould</i><c>should</c></NS> be</i><c>is</c></NS> possible we can <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>conduct</c></NS> an interview <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the last winner.</p>
<p>My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> the funny actor "Danny Brook". When we saw your advertisement in the "Evening Post" we made a reservation.</p>
<p>It would be nice <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> you if you could refund us some money or send us two new <NS type="AGN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I was at the show <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre three days ago. Unfortunately, my expectations <NS type="TV"><i>have not been</i><c>were not</c></NS> realized because of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> many problems I had during the show.</p>
<p>First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four <NS type="MP"><i>weeks</i><c>weeks'</c></NS> vacation <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. Secondly, for me, the best way to live in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>outdoor</i><c>outdoors</c></NS> is in tents, because that <NS type="TV"><i>will be</i><c>is</c></NS> a good chance to <NS type="RV"><i>learn</i><c>acquire</c></NS> a lot of knowledge about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> planets and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> animals as well.</p>
<p>In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent<NS type="UP"><i>. Because</i><c> because</c></NS> I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and <NS type="DJ"><i>every days</i><c>everyday</c></NS> comforts, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> these two weeks.</p>
<p>However, in your letter <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>written</i><c>mentioned</c></NS> some activities. I would choose Basketball and Tennis. <NS type="W"><i>Basketball I have been playing</i><c>I have been playing basketball</c></NS> in a team<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my town for ten years. Also <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> is my favourite hobby and I play twice <NS type="R"><i>every</i><c>a</c></NS> week with my friends.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> two from your list: <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball</i><c>basketball</c></NS>, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been <NS type="R"><i>taking part</i><c>part</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> a strong team for three years.</p>
<p>Many people "see" <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> shopping <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> an amusement, but I think <NS type="R">it's not always a good translation to give it</NS>. In my opinion <NS type="UV"><i>to do</i></NS> shopping is often <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS>, above all when you can enter <NS type="W"><i>without difficulties <NS type="UT"><i>into</i></NS> a shop</i><c>a shop without difficulties</c></NS>. For <NS type="S"><i>exemple</i><c>example</c></NS>, if the shop is full of people, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not enjoyable, because they will create too <NS type="MQ"><c>much</c></NS> confusion, too <NS type="MQ"><c>much</c></NS> noise <NS type="R">with the risk of</NS> <NS type="RV"><i>leaving</i><c>wasting</c></NS> time. Shopping is a <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS> thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> free time and when you can relax <NS type="UA"><i>yourself</i></NS>. Another thing that <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>regardes</i><c>regards</c></NS></i><c>occurs</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me, is that I enjoy <NS type="RP"><i>my self</i><c>myself</c></NS> more when I know I have to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>go</c></NS> shopping for <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>myself</c></NS> than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!!</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i><NS type="S"><i>Las</i><c>Last</c></NS></i><c>The last</c></NS> problem I would like to tell you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> is <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>restaraunt</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> decoration.</p>
<p>From your letter I was pleased to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. But could you, please, let me have more details about my <NS type="RN"><i>award</i><c>prize</c></NS>. What kind of people will be invited <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> your Camp <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> this summer? I would like to know with <NS type="S"><i>whome</i><c>whom</c></NS> I'll share <NS type="S"><i>sach</i><c>such</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> wonderful days <NS type="R">with the</NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> activities.</p>
<p>I would <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> choose <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> month <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> July, because I'm free <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this time from <NS type="UP"><i>family's</i><c>family</c></NS> duties.</p>
<p>First of all, in order <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="R">our firm purpose</NS> I wrote an <NS type="S"><i>inventation</i><c>invitation</c></NS> to my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> idol - <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> poet and <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> singer Boris Grebenchekoff. We <NS type="TV"><i>were renting</i><c>rented</c></NS> for him a special hall near Piccadilly Circus. The hall was crowded. His one-week concert programme was so <NS type="S"><i>succsessful</i><c>successful</c></NS> that we decided to invite him <NS type="RY">else</NS>, as soon as <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> tickets <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>all</c></NS> sold. I had a nice <NS type="S"><i>expirience</i><c>experience</c></NS> as manager too. I would like to be a professional in this <NS type="RN"><i>stage</i><c>area</c></NS>, <NS type="S">yeas</NS>. Do you share my <NS type="RN"><i>idea</i><c>ambition</c></NS>, Kim? <NS type="RP"><i>Is not</i><c>Isn't</c></NS> it a brilliant idea?</p>
<p>I would like to know if <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is possible for me <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because I have school <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> months, and it is impossible for me <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> December or January.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Instand</i><c>Instead</c></NS> of going to the <NS type="S"><i>theather</i><c>theatre</c></NS>, which is more cultural, or even <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>have</c></NS></i><c>having</c></NS> a picnic <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Ikurapiura park, people prefer <NS type="FV"><i>spends</i><c>spending</c></NS> all their money at <NS type="RN"><i>Shoppings</i><c>shopping centres</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>her</c></NS> relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John<NS type="RP">,</NS> loved each other so much that it wouldn't be <NS type="RJ"><i>rare</i><c>surprising</c></NS> to find that they had <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> sex <NS type="UY"><i>together</i></NS>. The point here is<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that Caroline <NS type="IV"><i>choosed</i><c>chose</c></NS> the worst friend to <NS type="FV"><i>told</i><c>tell</c></NS> this <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS>. She was also concerned about being <NS type="S"><i>pregned</i><c>pregnant</c></NS>, but she was afraid to <NS type="FV"><i>told</i><c>tell</c></NS> John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat <NS type="TV"><i>react</i><c>reacted</c></NS> in a very <NS type="RJ"><i>wrong</i><c>bad</c></NS> way and <NS type="AS"><i>told <NS type="RY"><i>rapidly</i><c>immediately</c></NS> to John</i><c>told John immediately</c></NS>. He couldn't <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>belived</i><c>believed</c></NS></i><c>believe</c></NS> what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a very expensive operation. But <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> every story this has a happy <NS type="RN"><i>final</i><c>ending</c></NS>. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her <NS type="RN"><i>fantasy</i><c>imagination</c></NS>. And Pat understood that <NS type="ID">secrets should die on your own</NS>.</p>
<p>The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> we would like to ask you if <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is possible to make some changes <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the programme<NS type="RP"><i>?</i><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>But <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of the day it <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>alway</i><c>always</c></NS> will</i><c>will always</c></NS> be <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> place to go! We find our family there and our life. Some of us have been living in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>one</i><c>same</c></NS> house since <NS type="RA"><i>they</i><c>we</c></NS> were born. We are sentimental and we have <NS type="FN"><i>memory</i><c>memories</c></NS> from the past. I think it's a part of our life.<NS type="U"><i>lf</i></NS></p>
<p>I could only travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In respect of</i><c>With regard to</c></NS> the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> such a <NS type="S"><i>hugh</i><c>huge</c></NS> variety, but I prefer to do those I <NS type="W"><i>better know</i><c>know better</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>practise</i><c>practising</c></NS> new techniques and <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>taking</c></NS> pictures of new landscapes.</p>
<p>Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> an unlimited budget whatever they need</i><c>whatever they need on an unlimited budget</c></NS>? And finally who has all the time needed to do so?</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At the end</i><c>In the end</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everything</c></NS> depends <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our <NS type="S"><i>attitud</i><c>attitude</c></NS> to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products <NS type="M"></NS> before going shopping. But even without money to spend <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is fun to rush from time to time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>through</c></NS> the sales that <NS type="S"><i>seasonaly</i><c>seasonally</c></NS> appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.</p>
<p>I have seen your letter <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now.</p>
<p>Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the event. First I didn't accept but finally she <NS type="S"><i>conviced</i><c>convinced</c></NS> me. It was the most <NS type="RJ"><i>excited</i><c>exciting</c></NS> experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and <NS type="FN"><i>drinks</i><c>drink</c></NS>. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I <NS type="TV"><i>prepare</i><c>prepared</c></NS> orange juices.</p>
<p>I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the <NS type="S"><i>Californiai</i><c>Californian</c></NS> summer is hot and dry so<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> 5 years in an amateur <NS type="RN"><i>franchise</i><c>team</c></NS> and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete <NS type="RN"><i>debutant</i><c>beginner</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>concerning</i><c>at</c></NS> surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>initiate</i><c>introduce</c></NS> myself to <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> exciting sport<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I still have some questions to ask you:</p>
<p>Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> yourself or people you <NS type="RV"><i>appreciate</i><c>like</c></NS> is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.</p>
<p>Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>unluckily</i><c>unfortunately</c></NS>, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> more frustration and tiredness.</p>
<p>In the first place, I prefer to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because my school will not be closed before this date. Secondly, a <NS type="RN"><i>tent</i><c>camping</c></NS> holiday <NS type="RV"><i>is</i><c>has</c></NS> always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="UP"><i>swimming-school</i><c>swimming school</c></NS></i><c>school swimming</c></NS> team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> good fun. <NS type="RT"><i>Because of</i><c>For</c></NS> these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> given.</p>
<p>Last month, I had a great time at the concert of "Dragon"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is the most popular <NS type="UP"><i>hard-rock</i><c>hard rock</c></NS> group <NS type="RT"><i>all over</i><c>in</c></NS> the world. They had a concert in my <NS type="RP"><i>hometown</i><c>home town</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that's why the <NS type="DN"><i>organizators</i><c>organisers</c></NS> were looking for young people who <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> speak English. I applied and <NS type="RP"><i>They</i><c>they</c></NS> took me on. I <NS type="RV"><i>took part</i><c>worked</c></NS> in the security department. The staff in that <NS type="S"><i>departnent</i><c>department</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> really friendly and helpful and they <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> also huge<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like giants. <NS type="S"><i>Basicly</i><c>Basically</c></NS>, I helped them <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>connecting</i><c>connect</c></NS></i><c>liaise</c></NS> with the local police and <NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>get</c></NS> some <NS type="DJ"><i>electronical</i><c>electronic</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>equipments</i><c>equipment</c></NS> that they needed. They treated me as if I was the private secretary of the department, because of this sometimes I felt that the power was in my hands. By the way, I have already been invited <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> their next <NS type="S"><i>concernt</i><c>concert</c></NS>. They gave me two free tickets. Would you like to come with me?</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the computer. It helps me when I <NS type="S"><i>studie</i><c>study</c></NS>. I can find many things <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> or <NS type="FV"><i>to write</i><c>write</c></NS> my compositions on it.</p>
<p>As you have seen<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology has changed my daily life a lot and I believe that it has changed it <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the better.</p>
<p>I have never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the U.S.A.</p>
<p>The best dates for me to travel<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> would be in July because <NS type="RY">actually</NS> I work in the <NS type="R"><i>communication firm</i><c>communications industry</c></NS> and I must ask <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation at camp, I prefer <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the log cabins, because <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet<NS type="RP"><i> so</i><c>.  So</c></NS> for this <NS type="RN"><i>fact</i><c>reason</c></NS>, I choose the log cabins.</p>
<p>Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> different <NS type="FN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of music, but in this case the main problem was that some <NS type="IN"><i>concerts hall</i><c>concert halls</c></NS> were too small, and because of <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> I couldn't see one of the concerts <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme.</p>
<p>In my opinion, one of the best things <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> the last Festival was that there were not only concerts <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS>. I saw films and I played ping-pong. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> the next <NS type="RN">edition</NS> will <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> be more or less <NS type="M"><c>of that</c></NS>? <NS type="W"><i>I hope more</i><c>More I hope</c></NS>. The thing that I liked much more than <NS type="R"><i>others</i><c>anything else</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was that I <NS type="W"><i>had to buy only</i><c>only had to buy</c></NS> one ticket for all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> events, and it was <NS type="RY"><i>no</i><c>not</c></NS> pricey.</p>
<p>So we can read realistic stories or fantastic <NS type="MA"><c>ones</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> depends <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> what we prefer.</p>
<p>I always prefer <NS type="FV"><i>read</i><c>to read</c></NS> books that are <NS type="DJ"><i>inusual</i><c>unusual</c></NS> in some way, because they give me the opportunity <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>escape</i><c>to escape</c></NS> from <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without <NS type="FN"><i>doubts</i><c>doubt</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> Wuthering Heights<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> a famous book written by Emily Brontë. The attention of the <unknown/> is focused on the unfortunate love <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>between</c></NS> Heatcliff and Catherine.</p>
<p>In other words, when I read a book I want to go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> a world where I can find something different from my everyday life.</p>
<p>There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show. <NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>In</c></NS> the advertisement, you mentioned Mr. Danny Brook and Ms. Tina Truelove were going to <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>perform</c></NS> but actually different people were <NS type="RV"><i>playing</i><c>performing</c></NS>, whom I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> never seen before. And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it <NS type="TV"><i>was not started</i><c>did not start</c></NS> until 20:15. To make it worse, neither discounts <NS type="X"><i>or</i><c>nor</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>restraurants</i><c>restaurants</c></NS> were available <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> that night although they were said to be available. According to the <NS type="S"><i>owener</i><c>owner</c></NS> of the restaurant, it was closed because <NS type="R">the plugs of some lights were cut off</NS>.</p>
<p>However, I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> there will be some <NS type="S"><i>diffences</i><c>differences</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> especially</i><c>especially with</c></NS> swimming costumes and athletes' <NS type="RN">costumes</NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="IN"><i>Olympic</i><c>Olympics</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> better quality <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> clothes will be <NS type="RV">created</NS> in every <NS type="R">field, such as sports, office, leisure, building site, school and space</NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>although</i><c>Although</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>outlooking</i><c>outlook</c></NS></i><c>appearance</c></NS> such as<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> shape and <NS type="SA"><i>color</i><c>colour</c></NS> will not <NS type="FV"><i>be changed</i><c>change</c></NS> so much in fashion.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to express my joy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>at</c></NS> having won <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS> prize. I am very happy. Secondly, you would like to know when I will be able to go there. Actually, I have asked my boss and he <NS type="TV"><i>gave</i><c>has given</c></NS> me two weeks <NS type="MT"><c>off</c></NS> in July. We have a lot to do at work so it is not easy to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> weeks off. Thirdly, I prefer staying in a tent <NS type="R"><i>than</i><c>to</c></NS> staying in a log cabin. I think it is more fun. Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing. I am very good at tennis. Last year, I took part in a competition and I did <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> well. I <NS type="W"><i>have also</i><c>also have</c></NS> a <NS type="W"><i>licence for sailing</i><c>sailing licence</c></NS> but I have not done it for a long time. I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me. I do not know if things are expensive there. Therefore, could you give me an idea of how much money I should bring with me.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets. I will be looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> it <NS type="FV"><i>was</i><c>to be</c></NS> a surprise. I worked hard <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> one month <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>so</c></NS> I could save <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> money to buy a <NS type="RN"><i>ticket for the plane</i><c>plane ticket</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she <NS type="RV"><i>didn't</i><c>wouldn't</c></NS> say anything but it wasn't true. Yesterday she phoned <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Alice and explained <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everything</c></NS>. In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities <NS type="M"><c>for us</c></NS> to do together <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>so</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>to spend</i><c>spend</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> the best week <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS>.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we <NS type="TV"><i>were waiting</i><c>waited</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> a long time, because <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> advertisement <NS type="RV"><i>noticed</i><c>stated</c></NS> that the <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15.</p>
<p>Moreover, the actors were not the same <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the ones in</c></NS> the advertisement. Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>. This evening was the worst evening of <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> my life.</p>
<p>I would like <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> me back some money <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the tickets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil. Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil <NS type="RY"><i>rapidly</i><c>posthaste</c></NS>. Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the outskirts of the city. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen. Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a <NS type="S"><i>beatiful</i><c>beautiful</c></NS> garden. When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased. We had to come back to Spain. Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs. When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> our parents all <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> our adventure.</p>
<p>That day was the worst day of <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> my <NS type="MJ"><c>whole</c></NS> life. <NS type="RY"><i>Nowadays</i><c>Now</c></NS>, Sally and I are married, have three children, a marvellous house and both of us are working <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> a big company.</p>
<p>It is rare <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> schools <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> don't have a multimedia centre with many computers <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the students <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>to use</c></NS>. But <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS> is good and bad <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time. Good because you can have <NS type="S"><i>acess</i><c>access</c></NS> to a lot of <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS>, and it is bad because the computers are <NS type="RV"><i>getting</i><c>doing</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> the certain <NS type="MN"><c>knowledge</c></NS> that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> computers will not <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>take</c></NS> the place of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> teachers? It is interesting to <NS type="FV"><i>starts</i><c>start</c></NS> to think about this point.</p>
<p>Another point is that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> television is taking <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> childhood <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>away from</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> children. For example, our parents had time to <NS type="FV"><i>played</i><c>play</c></NS> with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only <NS type="AGV"><i>shows</i><c>show</c></NS> silly programmes.</p>
<p>In the future we can expect <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>to have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> new material and it will make our <NS type="RN"><i>living</i><c>life</c></NS> more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> and <NS type="S"><i>convinient</i><c>convenient</c></NS>. In Japan, crime <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>among</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>minority</i><c>minors</c></NS> is increasing. It <NS type="TV"><i>said</i><c>is said</c></NS> that <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> one of the reasons <NS type="M"><c>is that a</c></NS> small <NS type="S"><i>separete</i><c>separate</c></NS> room makes <NS type="L"><i>kids</i><c>children</c></NS> unsociable and <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>dissapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS></i><c>depressed</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thanks for your letter. I am very happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the news. Also <NS type="M"></NS> to know about the all accommodation and travel costs that <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>including</i><c>included</c></NS> in the first prize.</p>
<p>For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend <NS type="W"><i>after some hours</i><c>some hours after</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>since</i></NS> he has written it. My friend lives in Kresnodar. My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar. And it takes 3 days <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> her letter to get to Kursk. That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>post</i><c>postal</c></NS> service. So with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have a lot of work <NS type="MV"><c>to do</c></NS> and my parents wish to see me <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> this month, so if it is possible to arrange the <NS type="FN"><i>date</i><c>dates</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> would be very nice.</p>
<p>Third, I love playing basketball<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am a great player and I play <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>for</c></NS> my University and I like to be playing all the time so <NS type="W"><i>this activity I will not <NS type="TV"><i>missed</i><c>miss</c></NS></i><c>I will not miss this activity</c></NS>. The other activity would be <NS type="RN"><i>surf</i><c>surfing</c></NS>. I think <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is very cool and I want to learn.</p>
<p>She <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> see if it is pretty or not, if it is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>discount</i><c>sale</c></NS> at <NS type="AGQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> store<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> not buy the dress and we <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but <NS type="R"><i>at the final of</i><c>after</c></NS> seeing all the stores and looking <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> all the dresses she <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>decided</i><c>decide</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the first <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS> we saw. It <NS type="RV"><i>is</i><c>would be</c></NS> horrible.</p>
<p>As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop <NS type="RN"><i>mania</i><c>maniac</c></NS>. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> electric shock <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency <NS type="AGN"><i>accident</i><c>accidents</c></NS> so I could enjoy the concert without a <NS type="RN">hurry</NS>. I was definitely over the moon!</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>As it wasn't enough</i><c>As if that wasn't enough</c></NS>, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and <NS type="M"><c>it is</c></NS> not very hard to guess <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> I wasn't able to enjoy it, as <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to <NS type="RV"><i>sell</i><c>serve</c></NS> food<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> the perfect ending <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the perfect evening.</p>
<p>Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go <NS type="R"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> spend the money <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a good play <NS type="RY"><i>when</i><c>where</c></NS> they do what they've promised.</p>
<p>In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. <NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>By</c></NS> a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>or</c></NS> a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play <NS type="MN"><c>games</c></NS> or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school.</p>
<p>I've <NS type="W"><i>been recently</i><c>recently been</c></NS> to one of <NS type="DD"><i>yours</i><c>your</c></NS> musical shows called "Over the rainbow" <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle theatre in London<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> thinking it might be a good idea but it was <NS type="S"><i>desappointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS>. I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> this letter to explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you what <NS type="TV"><i>had happened</i><c>happened</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i>look</i><c>to look</c></NS> for a solution.</p>
<p>To begin, the <NS type="S"><i>organitzation</i><c>organisation</c></NS> of your <NS type="S"><i>collegues</i><c>colleagues</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the theatre was awful <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>diferents</i><c>different</c></NS></i><c>various</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>problems</i><c>reasons</c></NS>. Despite saying it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> start at 19:30, it <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>started</c></NS> at 20:15<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I think is <NS type="W"><i><NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> much</i><c>much too</c></NS> late for a good theatre like yours. <NS type="RY"><i>After</i><c>Also</c></NS>, you say in the advertisement <NS type="M"><c>we should</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> your restaurant, however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was <NS type="RJ"><i>close</i><c>closed</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, how</i><c>. How</c></NS> can you explain that?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so <NS type="R">without want</NS> I knew that <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> was going to be a concert <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>owr</i><c>our</c></NS> city <NS type="MV"><c>given</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS>, from my point of view, the best group <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world, Oasis. And she had planned with my friends <NS type="FV"><i>went</i><c>to go</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>there</i></NS> without me.</p>
<p>At first I got <NS type="W"><i>angry with Pat more</i><c>more angry with Pat</c></NS> than with <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> friends <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the group, <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> Pat was and is my best friend. However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked <NS type="RA"><i>she</i><c>her</c></NS> why. She answered <NS type="U"><i>to me</i></NS> <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS></i><c>, "Because</c></NS> all this year <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>you</c></NS> have been so <NS type="RJ"><i>irritated</i><c>irritable</c></NS> that <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>you</c></NS> got angry with <NS type="R"><i>every person</i><c>everybody</c></NS> who tried to talk to <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>you</c></NS>,<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> and the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> had convinced her to <NS type="RV"><i>let me out</i><c>dump me</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I asked her to <NS type="RV"><i>look</i><c>take</c></NS> photos of Oasis for me and she <NS type="RV"><i>accepted</i><c>agreed to</c></NS>. If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> not being able to go.</p>
<p><NS type="DT"><i>On the behalf of</i><c>On behalf of</c></NS> all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> English culture... However, we would like to suggest <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> something:</p>
<p>We were there at 19:15<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as the show was starting at 19:30<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>to get</c></NS> our tickets. We asked for the discounts you <NS type="TV"><i>were <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>refering</i><c>referring</c></NS></i><c>mentioning</c></NS></i><c>mentioned</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement but <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the counter <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> told us that they were not available because it was Sunday.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>For</c></NS> all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> was<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> We are asking you to return our money. <NS type="MA"><i>Hope</i><c>I hope</c></NS> you'll understand<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. From the time she was a child she couldn't keep anything <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> herself, she always shared her thoughts with other people<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family. She went to a new school and she had no friends. She was not very sociable and she could not <NS type="RV"><i>create</i><c>establish</c></NS> relationships very easily. <NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>In</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> time she became close <NS type="FN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> with Kim, who was really strange to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> other students<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> everybody</i><c>. Everybody</c></NS> disliked her.</p>
<p>Pat <NS type="RP"><i>Kept</i><c>kept</c></NS> this a secret for two months but one day <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>revealed</c></NS> it by accident to a boy <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> her class. In a few days all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> school <NS type="RV"><i>was familiar with</i><c>knew</c></NS> Kim's story. Kim was <NS type="RJ">terrified</NS> because everyone was making fun <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> her and <NS type="MA"><c>she</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> very angry with Pat.</p>
<p>Another problem was <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> the start of the show. When I finished <NS type="DN"><i>working</i><c>work</c></NS> I had to <NS type="RV"><i>hurry up</i><c>rush</c></NS> because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. <NS type="ID"><i>For my surprise</i><c>To my surprise</c></NS>, when I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15!</p>
<p>When the show was over I went to have dinner <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is <NS type="TV"><i>lacked</i><c>lacking</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> employees.</p>
<p>I advise you to pay more attention <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.</p>
<p><NS type="MA"><i>All</i><c>It all</c></NS> began when, three days ago, I was doing <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> homework in my <NS type="RN"><i>class</i><c>classroom</c></NS>. I was alone because Pat had to go <NS type="W"><i>with her parents to the cinema</i><c>to the cinema with her parents</c></NS>. Suddenly, I heard <NS type="DN"><i>step noises</i><c>footsteps</c></NS> that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher <NS type="RV"><i>went out</i><c>left</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>class</i><c>classroom</c></NS>. I was <NS type="S"><i>boried</i><c>bored</c></NS>, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. "See you tomorrow!" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my <NS type="RN"><i>class</i><c>classroom</c></NS> I saw he hadn't switched off the light <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had <NS type="RV"><i>forgotten</i><c>left</c></NS> our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> next day were there. <NS type="ID"><i>Without thinking it twice</i><c>Without thinking twice</c></NS>, I took one of them and <NS type="W"><i>went quickly</i><c>quickly went</c></NS> home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which <NS type="AS"><i>were the questions of the exam</i><c>questions were in the exam</c></NS>. When I told her <NS type="R"><i>this piece of</i><c>the</c></NS> news, she <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>was</c></NS> surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> anybody else. Next day<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams.</p>
<p> I am writing in reply to your letter <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> the 15th <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> May. I would like to provide some further information you are asking me for.</p>
<p>I would like <NS type="R"><i>some</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>refand</i><c>refund</c></NS> because <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> was one of the worst evenings <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> if</i><c>. If</c></NS> this matter <NS type="RV"><i>does</i><c>is</c></NS> not <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>solve</i><c>solved</c></NS></i><c>resolved</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS>  I will <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> further. I hope that it will be <NS type="RV"><i>solved</i><c>resolved</c></NS> properly<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. He and his friends got <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> trouble because of this habit<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> last week.</p>
<p>As they were watching <NS type="UP"><i>T.V</i><c>TV</c></NS> at Nick's house last Sunday, Sally noticed that their <NS type="RN"><i>cut</i><c>cat</c></NS> Curly was hurt, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> she could not walk. The children were very unhappy and <NS type="MV"><c>felt</c></NS> sorry <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the pet. "Somebody <NS type="TV"><i>had hurt</i><c>hurt</c></NS> her and <NS type="TV"><i>had <NS type="RV"><i>let</i><c>left</c></NS></i><c>left</c></NS> her without help"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Mourk said angrily. "We have to find him and make him pay for his action"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Sally told them. <NS type="S"><i>Everybod</i><c>Everybody</c></NS> agreed with her.</p>
<p>The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> entry <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the show is free for students.</p>
<p>You see, the programme <NS type="W"><i>has only</i><c>only has</c></NS> to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping <NS type="M"></NS> how you have organised <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> your programme. In our opinion<NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> it is enough to go one time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a museum and it is on Wednesday <NS type="M"></NS>.</p>
<p>In the advertisement the time when the show should start was 19.30 but it started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20:15. When I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre and <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> for the discount, it wasn't available. In your <NS type="L"><i>adv.</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the show</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>starring was</i><c>was starring</c></NS> Danny Brook, and on the stage <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>plaied</i><c>played</c></NS></i><c>performed</c></NS> different actor</i><c>different actor performed</c></NS> and his <NS type="RN"><i>play</i><c>acting</c></NS> was very poor. The whole show and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> acting was <NS type="R"><i>an <NS type="S"><i>profeccion</i><c>profession</c></NS> like</i><c>of a standard comparable to</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>scholl</i><c>school</c></NS> theatre. When we decided to visit <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre Restaurant after the show it was <NS type="S"><i>clouse</i><c>closed</c></NS> because <NS type="SX"><i>same</i><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> decorating wasn't <NS type="DJ"><i>finish</i><c>finished</c></NS>. It was <NS type="MD"><c>this</c></NS> last <NS type="S"><i>poin</i><c>point</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to get</i><c>got</c></NS> me angry. After <NS type="S"><i>evrything</i><c>everything</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>happend</i><c>happened</c></NS></i><c>had happened</c></NS> we went to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> hotel <NS type="R">tipped and very affect</NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>In</c></NS> the last one hundred years science and technology <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>has taken</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> big step<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if we <NS type="FV"><i>looking</i><c>look</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> back. <NS type="R"><i>Same thing</i><c>Similarly,</c></NS> more <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> 100 years <NS type="SX"><i>ego</i><c>ago</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people <NS type="X"><i>haven't got</i><c>didn't have</c></NS> the light <NS type="MN"><c>bulb</c></NS>. They <NS type="UV"><i>were</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>used just</i><c>just used</c></NS> a candle. Nobody <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>thinking</i><c>thought</c></NS> about the Telephone, and telegraph. From <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> small village to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> town was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very long way <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people used <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> horse and wagon.</p>
<p>And I can continue my list <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> this way... <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> science never <NS type="AGV"><i>stop</i><c>stops</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> one place.</p>
<p>First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time to adjust <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="DN">multi culture</NS> in the language <NS type="S"><i>institue</i><c>institute</c></NS>. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> I could meet some friend, <NS type="UC"><i>but</i></NS> I couldn't express my <NS type="RN">heat</NS> to them <NS type="L"><i>for</i><c>because</c></NS> we have different <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>back ground</i><c>background</c></NS></i><c>backgrounds</c></NS> and our first <NS type="AGN"><i>language</i><c>languages</c></NS> were different.</p>
<p>One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> weekend <NS type="S"><i>usally</i><c>usually</c></NS>. We had a fantastic time together for three <NS type="S"><i>monthes</i><c>months</c></NS>. <NS type="W"><i>Even we could</i><c>We could even</c></NS> make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books.</p>
<p>About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>to travel</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> I won't have classes at school by that time. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>As to</c></NS> the matter of accommodation I'd <NS type="UV"><i>rather</i></NS> prefer <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>, because I consider them better for resting and <NS type="MV"><c>getting</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>to know</c></NS> people.</p>
<p>For the attention <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were <NS type="R">invited to the estatement</NS> were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> his performance. In addition, the <NS type="RN"><i>event</i><c>show</c></NS> was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>were</i><c>be</c></NS> able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> the Chef who <NS type="RV"><i>leaded</i><c>runs</c></NS> the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets would be available, but <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization <NS type="R"><i>of</i><c>running</c></NS> the theatre <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>gave</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back. yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Peter had a <NS type="DJ"><i>terribly</i><c>terrible</c></NS> problem with drugs. He started to <NS type="S"><i>consum</i><c>consume</c></NS> the stuff at the age of twenty. He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> Australia, but Peter was used to <NS type="FV"><i>live</i><c>living</c></NS> in New York, <NS type="M"><c>where it is</c></NS> overcrowded and <NS type="M"><c>he was</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>surronded</i><c>surrounded</c></NS> by people. Australia is <NS type="W"><i>a country too calm</i><c>too calm a country</c></NS> for him.</p>
<p>We invited him to <NS type="UV"><i>enjoy</i></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>concert of Texas</i><c>Texas concert</c></NS> but he started to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>talk</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>nonsenses</i><c>nonsense</c></NS> because of the drugs. Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert. A security guard saw <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS> and <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>turned</c></NS> his attention <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> him. Pat stared at him and asked for help. The security guard heard her and <NS type="IV"><i>agreeded</i><c>agreed</c></NS> with Pat that if Peter continued acting <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> this way he would <NS type="RV"><i>obliged</i><c>advise</c></NS> us to <NS type="RV"><i>go out of</i><c>leave</c></NS> the concert.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> only travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> summer holiday. But I have booked a flight <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> home at the beginning of <NS type="S"><i>Auguest</i><c>August</c></NS>. And also I would like to go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> summer.</p>
<p>1. English lesson. Because <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> students in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> English class are from all over the world<NS type="RP"><i>. We</i><c>, we</c></NS> can talk <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> everybody's <NS type="FN"><i>feeling</i><c>feelings</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> living and <NS type="FV"><i>study</i><c>studying</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a foreign country.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>For what <NS type="S"><i>concernes</i><c>concerns</c></NS></i><c>Concerning</c></NS> the activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me. I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses. On the other hand I have never <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>taken</c></NS> a course <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby.</p>
<p>I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by <NS type="RV"><i>visiting</i><c>seeing</c></NS> it. I believed in the phrase <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect.</p>
<p>But in the winter there's still a problem <NS type="UA"><i>which</i></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> to solve. In the winter you'll freeze. But this problem is solving <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>itselfes</i><c>itself</c></NS>. The <NS type="S"><i>sommers</i><c>summers</c></NS> and winters get warmer. The <NS type="RN"><i>season</i><c>reason</c></NS> for this is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> global warming, which is the <NS type="RN"><i>salvation</i><c>solution</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the problem and another reason why this idea is possible.</p>
<p>But <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>in</c></NS> some situations you have to wear something. The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special <NS type="RN"><i>kind</i><c>method</c></NS> of <NS type="DN"><i>producing</i><c>production</c></NS>.</p>
<p>So don't laugh <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>at</c></NS> this idea. Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it. It's possible.</p>
<p>I was very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> my supposed "perfect evening out" <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre and <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>for</c></NS> all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets.</p>
<p>Besides all those improvements and <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>confort</i><c>comfort</c></NS></i><c>comforts</c></NS> I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> already fallen <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> wicked hands.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> order to complain <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> my unpleasant experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show "<NS type="RP"><i>over the rainbow</i><c>Over the Rainbow</c></NS>" at your theatre. The advertised <NS type="DN"><i>beginning time</i><c>starting time</c></NS> is 19:30<NS type="UP"><i>. But</i><c> but</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>due to</i><c>for</c></NS> some unknown <NS type="FN"><i>reasons</i><c>reason</c></NS>, the play didn't start until 20:15. The audience were anxious and bored.</p>
<p>What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage at all. <NS type="R"><i>A second-class actor</i><c>An understudy</c></NS> took <NS type="W"><i>the place of him</i><c>his place</c></NS>. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the <NS type="RN"><i>conductor</i><c>ticket office</c></NS> didn't offer me any discounts<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as you had advertised <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the poster<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when I bought the ticket.</p>
<p>Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> practical use, our living <NS type="FN"><i>condition</i><c>conditions</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>becomes</i><c>become</c></NS></i><c>are becoming</c></NS> more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the house, it is easy to find things like <NS type="UA"><i>these</i></NS><NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> microwave oven, TV set, computer<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> etc. All these <NS type="M"><c>items of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>equippments</i><c>equipment</c></NS> are <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> train, car or even <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> plane as your <NS type="M"><c>means of</c></NS> transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> several years to reach <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> destination.</p>
<p>Second, <NS type="RP"><i>Modern</i><c>modern</c></NS> technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable. With the spreading use of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>via</c></NS> the web. And<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we can also share important <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> with other people. The development of information technology has changed the world into "<NS type="DN"><i>an earth village</i><c>a global village</c></NS>".</p>
<p>Modern technology plays an important role in our <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>. I am hoping to devote myself <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>the development of it</i><c>its development</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The truth <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> Shopping</p>
<p>Shopping... a great and <NS type="DJ"><i>emotion</i><c>emotional</c></NS> statement, don't you think? <NS type="RP"><i>Every one</i><c>Everyone</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>think</i><c>thinks</c></NS> that shopping <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>is</c></NS> the best way to <NS type="RV"><i>carry off</i><c>get rid of</c></NS> your problems and, in fact a big solution <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> many <NS type="AGN"><i>problem</i><c>problems</c></NS> or <NS type="DN">estrés</NS>, boring, or only for distraction.</p>
<p>This summer, I am available <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>Agust</i><c>August</c></NS> my family and I are going to go to Canada and <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> September I will go back <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> university. If there is no chance to go to California <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, I could wait <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> next summer.</p>
<p>It was brilliant! I had the best month <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I worked 12 hours per day but <NS type="S"><i>alwalys</i><c>always</c></NS> with <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS> people. My job was cleaning the <NS type="RN"><i>ground</i><c>floor</c></NS> after the concert; "it was very dirty". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="X"><i>had not</i><c>didn't have</c></NS> to pay <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>to get</c></NS> in.</p>
<p>Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>met</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> new friends and I know that <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert there <NS type="AGV"><i>isn't</i><c>aren't</c></NS> any <NS type="AGN"><i>drunk</i><c>drunks</c></NS> just <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS><NS type="R"><i> and</i><c>,</c></NS> wonderful people.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> "Doctor Meesee"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is the best concert in the world<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I hope you will come there. You have to save up <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..).</p>
<p>So, as you can see, modern technology has had <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> influence <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my life.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>First at all</i><c>First of all</c></NS>, I'd like to <NS type="FV"><i>thanks</i><c>thank</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> for the prize <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Won</i><c>won</c></NS>. I'd like to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>get to know</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> USA. <NS type="RP"><i>this</i><c>This</c></NS> prize came <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a good time.</p>
<p>I'd like to <NS type="S"><i>travell</i><c>travel</c></NS> in <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS> the only <NS type="R"><i>one</i><c>month</c></NS> that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> because I can't bear sleeping in a tent<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I hate <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> kind of <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>. But I love sports. I'd like to play <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>go</c></NS> swimming<NS type="MP"><i> these</i><c>.  These</c></NS> are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better <NS type="MT"><c>you</c></NS> I can swim, because since I was <NS type="R"><i>I</i><c>a</c></NS> child I've been <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>playing</c></NS> it. I've already <NS type="RP"><i>Won</i><c>won</c></NS> three prizes <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>We had a class discussion about shopping, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> it I'm writing to <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>explain</c></NS> about my opinion.</p>
<p>I have recently <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter <NS type="MV"><c>saying</c></NS> that I have won the first prize in the competition. It was very <NS type="S"><i>fortuanate</i><c>fortunate</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which normally is the only <NS type="S"><i>appropreaite</i><c>appropriate</c></NS> time! Not only <NS type="W"><i>shops are</i><c>are shops</c></NS> crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous <NS type="FN"><i>queue</i><c>queues</c></NS>. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> 'shopping'.</p>
<p>In answer to your <NS type="FN"><i>questions</i><c>question</c></NS>, I will have to say that I <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RY"><i>just</i><c>only</c></NS> can</i><c>can only</c></NS> go to the <NS type="DN"><i>campament</i><c>camp</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because of my job<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> they only gave me that month <NS type="RJ"><i>free</i><c>off</c></NS>.</p>
<p>We <NS type="W"><i>all have</i><c>have all</c></NS> been <NS type="S"><i>shooping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> once in our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS> and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? <NS type="RP"><i>we</i><c>We</c></NS> had a class discussion and we all agree <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> some points.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and <NS type="RA"><i>then</i><c>that</c></NS> is <NS type="RC"><i>where</i><c>when</c></NS> the problems begin. Most of the <NS type="FN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>one</i><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>get</i><c>gets</c></NS> lost, or they start <NS type="IV"><i>plaing</i><c>playing</c></NS> around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> a bad mood and you'll have a bad <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>shooping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> day</i><c>day shopping</c></NS>.</p>
<p>During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, <NS type="R"><i>how it</i><c>as</c></NS> was <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>promised</c></NS> in the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>. It <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>was also told</i><c>also told</c></NS></i><c>also said</c></NS> that the evening shows <NS type="TV"><i>are starting</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a £20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of <NS type="M"></NS> illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also <NS type="UC"><i>because</i></NS> I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>. I hope you will answer my letter and <NS type="RV"><i>correct</i><c>solve</c></NS> the problems <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p>I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show "over the rainbow". I was very disappointed because the actors <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Instead of them you had different actors. Then the show <NS type="TV"><i>delayed</i><c>was delayed</c></NS>, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30. I had to wait 45 minutes! Another <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>thing</c></NS> is that the discounts <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> available although I <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>red</i><c>read</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>earlier</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>notice</i><c>advert</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>when</c></NS> I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the restaurant it had been closed. But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the <NS type="S"><i>resaurant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> after the show. I can't understand <NS type="RD"><i>such</i><c>this</c></NS> kind of <NS type="AGN"><i>mistakes</i><c>mistake</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Modern technology has changed my daily life in the <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>sense</c></NS> that <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everything</c></NS> I do is becoming <NS type="RJ"><i>more comfortable</i><c>easier</c></NS>. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> something like a <NS type="S"><i>telefonnumber</i><c>telephone number</c></NS> or an <NS type="S"><i>adress</i><c>address</c></NS> I also look it up <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. I <NS type="W"><i>use also</i><c>also use</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> when I need any <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> I need <NS type="R"><i>them</i><c>some information</c></NS> for school or <NS type="DY"><i>private</i><c>privately</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for myself. A few years ago I had to go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a library and look <NS type="R"><i>it</i><c>things</c></NS> up in many books. <NS type="UA"><i>Most that</i><c>That</c></NS> took a long time.</p>
<p>Modern technology, such as <NS type="AGN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS>, <NS type="AGN"><i>car</i><c>cars</c></NS> and other <NS type="R"><i>else</i><c>things</c></NS>, <NS type="TV"><i>changed</i><c>have changed</c></NS> my life in many different ways <NS type="R"><i>like</i><c>such as</c></NS> communication, <NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS> and working. For example, a car, which is used <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> everyone <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>, changed my daily life in the <NS type="S"><i>sens</i><c>sense</c></NS> that I don't need my dad or my mum to go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology, but because I can show that I am <NS type="S"><i>responsable</i><c>responsible</c></NS>. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries <NS type="SX"><i>that</i><c>than</c></NS> Switzerland.</p>
<p>Another <NS type="MQ"><c>piece of</c></NS> technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS>, <NS type="CN"><i>works</i><c>work</c></NS>, photos, but the most important <NS type="ID"><i>at my eyes</i><c>in my eyes</c></NS> is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> communication with my friends from different parts of the world <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>via</c></NS> the web. This <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>a big walk in</i><c>a big step for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. <NS type="RY"><i>At last</i><c>Finally</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the piece of</c></NS> technology that I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>bring out</i><c>emphasise</c></NS> is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or <NS type="MA"><c>something</c></NS> else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> here <NS type="MC"><c>something</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the most important in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>change</i><c>changing</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> my daily life <NS type="M"></NS>. </p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because for me it is the best time and I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> travel before or after <NS type="M"></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> according to my employer. <NS type="R"><i>While</i><c>During</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> two weeks I would like to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because you can be nearer to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>than</c></NS> you are <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>.

<p>I think one <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>alternative</c></NS> is to buy your things on the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, because then you <NS type="X"><i>have not</i><c>don't have</c></NS> to invest a lot of time <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> buying all <NS type="AGQ"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> things, and they bring you the things <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> home<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> In the end I think it is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> best if you have the <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>chance</c></NS> to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.</p>
<p>Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> situation you are in because when I was a child I always had <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>argument</i><c>arguments</c></NS> with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very <NS type="DJ"><i>ashameful</i><c>shameful</c></NS> for my mum. She was also very angry<NS type="UP"><i>. Because</i><c> because</c></NS> she never managed to get me out <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the toy shop.</p>
<p>If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. "Cry Freedom", <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice?</p>
<p>However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> love of justice, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>mythes</i><c>myths</c></NS></i><c>legends</c></NS>, and "Cry Freedom" is one of them.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would like to say something about the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS>: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS>. So the main <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>purpose</c></NS> of my visit had <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>dissappeared</i><c>disappeared</c></NS></i><c>failed</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS>. A serious theatre can't <NS type="RV"><i>miss</i><c>fail</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> such an important thing, the <NS type="RN"><i>starting-time</i><c>time of the performance</c></NS>. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was <NS type="UV"><i>going</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to pay</i><c>paying</c></NS> for the tickets, I found another thing <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS>: there were no discounts <NS type="S"><i>avaible</i><c>available</c></NS>. In your advertisement you informed us <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> their false existence.</p>
<p>An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can <NS type="RV"><i>discover</i><c>find</c></NS> more information than <NS type="M"><c>I can in</c></NS> a newspaper, and also information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> all around the world, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>possibly never I <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS></i><c>I could never possibly</c></NS> access without <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet. But, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is not only news or information. You can <NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS> with people <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>place</i><c>places</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> you <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> never <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> imagine <NS type="R"><i>to have a trip</i><c>going to</c></NS> because it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be too expensive. An <NS type="RN"><i>extract</i><c>example</c></NS> could be the popular <NS type="RN"><i>chats</i><c>chat rooms</c></NS>, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like <NS type="FV"><i>to use</i><c>using</c></NS> the keyboard to <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>say</c></NS> something or <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS></i><c>to communicate</c></NS>, you can use video <NS type="RN"><i>conference</i><c>conferencing</c></NS>, a <NS type="S"><i>sistem</i><c>system</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>lets</c></NS> you <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> is the <NS type="RN"><i>possibility of</i><c>potential</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>download</i><c>to download</c></NS> things to your <NS type="RP"><i>pc</i><c>PC</c></NS> like software, pictures and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> also, music. The modern technologies <NS type="RV"><i>make me</i><c>mean I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a <NS type="DN">reproductor</NS>, I can <NS type="RV"><i>wear</i><c>carry</c></NS> this music <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>everywere</i><c>everywhere</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Also computers and mobile phones <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>evolutioned</i><c>evolved</c></NS> thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> probably still <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> ancient times. Who wants to return to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no <NS type="UP"><i>TV's</i><c>TVs</c></NS>, no phones, no <NS type="UP"><i>PC's</i><c>PCs</c></NS>.. I'm afraid that the people <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> ancient times lived although they <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> have <NS type="R"><i>anything</i><c>any</c></NS> of these things, but me and everyone <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like <NS type="FV"><i>return</i><c>to return</c></NS> to this life. <NS type="RY"><i>As well</i><c>Also</c></NS>, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> are <NS type="UY"><i>so</i></NS> expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>  is because <NS type="RA"><i>anything</i><c>something</c></NS> new is at <NS type="R"><i>the moment for</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>sell</i><c>to sell</c></NS>. <NS type="MA"><i>Is</i><c>It is</c></NS> like a <NS type="UJ"><i>round</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>tour</i><c>circle</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some students would like to film the <NS type="W"><i>football school team</i><c>school football team</c></NS>, because football is the most <NS type="R">practised</NS> activity <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>among</c></NS> the students.</p>
<p>However, something wrong <NS type="RV"><i>came up</i><c>occurred</c></NS> again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the <NS type="S"><i>brocher</i><c>brochure</c></NS>, did not play a part in the show. And I <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> really disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> show, but it was closed because it was <NS type="FV"><i>refurbishing</i><c>being refurbished</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>interior</i></NS>. I am not satisfied with your show as it was <NS type="S"><i>compeletly</i><c>completely</c></NS> different from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> advertisement.</p>
<p>In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement, I had a very <NS type="S"><i>disapointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> evening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Leon's birthday had failed. However, <NS type="TV"><i>we've</i><c>we'd</c></NS> started to <NS type="RV"><i>search</i><c>plan</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>an idea</i></NS> for it <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> one <NS type="AGN"><i>months</i><c>month</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>before</c></NS>. <NS type="ID"><i>In the beginning</i><c>To start with</c></NS>, I wanted to bring him <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at <NS type="UA"><i>his</i></NS> home. So Sigone <NS type="RV"><i>found</i><c>thought of</c></NS> the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought <NS type="W"><i>for him a dog</i><c>a dog for him</c></NS>. Leon <NS type="AGV"><i>hate</i><c>hates</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>dog</i><c>dogs</c></NS>, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't <NS type="FV"><i>recognized</i><c>recognise</c></NS>. And I found one. I had a friend who had just <NS type="RV"><i>received</i><c>got</c></NS> a little dog. But he was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> Camp California in the U.S.A.<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I expect to <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>travel</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will have a long <NS type="CL"><i>holiday break</i><c>holiday</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> that time and my children have to go to France with <NS type="UN"><i>student's</i></NS> school <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July as well. I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very good time to <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>travel</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> without worries.</p>
<p>Today I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> I went <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> last month<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>I</c></NS></i><c>. I</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> got a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> to talk about.</p>
<p>By the way<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>had done</i><c>did</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> that concert. I had to <NS type="RV">connect with</NS> people who <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> responsible <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS> ticket. They had to check when people came in the hall and I was <NS type="U"><i>the one who</i></NS> checking the tickets as well. You know, you have to <NS type="R">very strongly</NS> when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't <NS type="S"><i>weait</i><c>wait</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>frount</i><c>front</c></NS> and they <NS type="UV"><i>are</i></NS> try to go <NS type="RT"><i>over</i><c>through</c></NS> very quickly. So you have to <NS type="FV"><i>explaining</i><c>explain</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>too</i></NS> <NS type="L"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS> to make people <NS type="S"><i>clamed</i><c>calm</c></NS> down and <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>standed</i><c>stood</c></NS></i><c>stand</c></NS> in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> row. It was very hard for me and I won't do it again.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On the one hand</i><c>First of all</c></NS>, a big problem <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the children. When they go <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that <NS type="R"><i>their sight reach</i><c>they see</c></NS>: doors, little cars, films... but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, <NS type="R"><i>there</i><c>then</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>are the children</i><c>the children are</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> crying because they are tired <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> shopping all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> day.</p>
<p>I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to come at</c></NS> that time. And <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>concerning</c></NS> my accommodation<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS></i><c>to stay</c></NS> in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere <NS type="R"><i>when</i><c>in which</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>live</i><c>will be living</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS>.</p>
<p>What's more, the theatre <NS type="S"><i>reastaurant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>was</c></NS> closed<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when the show finished<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> the show started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20:15. It should have started at 19:30 as you said <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> advertisement, <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> you should not have closed <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> before the show finished.</p>
<p>Thank you for your <NS type="DJ"><i>informing</i><c>informative</c></NS> letter and your congratulations. I was <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize. I'm <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> looking forward to it as I've never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the U.S.A. before.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="R"><i>date of the travel</i><c>best dates for my visit</c></NS>, I wonder if it would be possible <NS type="MV"><c>to come</c></NS> in July because I'm going to <NS type="RV"><i>pass</i><c>sit</c></NS> a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> for me to relax after that.</p>
<p>You asked <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> my accommodation <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>either</c></NS> tents <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>had</c></NS> a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year)</p>
<p>After having <NS type="RV"><i>visited</i><c>looked around</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shops <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for<NS type="RP"><i>. The</i><c> - the</c></NS> shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive)<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> So I went back to the station, very proud of <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>myself</c></NS> with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face.</p>
<p>I stayed <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> happy during the <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>journey</c></NS>, thinking of how cool I would look <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the playground with my <NS type="MP"><i>brand new</i><c>brand-new</c></NS> shoes on.</p>
<p>As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>. </c></NS> I had <NS type="RV"><i>forgotten</i><c>left</c></NS> it <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the train!</p>
<p>How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> old shoes for one more summer...</p>
<p>As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I helped at a pop concert last month<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I did things as unusual <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> me as cleaning instruments, <NS type="FV"><i>organise</i><c>organising</c></NS> people, and also <NS type="FV"><i>look</i><c>looking</c></NS> after the <NS type="W"><i>clothes of the artists</i><c>artists' clothes</c></NS>. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only <NS type="FV"><i>wait</i><c>to wait</c></NS> there and give them what they asked for. <NS type="FV"><i>Organise</i><c>Organising</c></NS> people involved<NS type="UT"><i>,</i></NS> just a couple of things, <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>say to</i><c>saying to</c></NS></i><c>telling</c></NS> people how to do the same as me and when.</p>
<p>The most exciting <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> listen to the Concert <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> the very first <NS type="RN"><i>position</i><c>row</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at. The second activity I chose is sailing. I <NS type="TV"><i>went</i><c>have been</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>two times on a sailing ship</i><c>on a sailing ship two times</c></NS> without doing anything, therefore <NS type="W"><i>have I</i><c>I have</c></NS> got no experience at all.</p>
<p>However, this apparently <NS type="SX"><i>quite</i><c>quiet</c></NS> and relaxed <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you about your questions. First, I can come there only <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new <NS type="S"><i>turm</i><c>term</c></NS> will also start in September. I would like to stay <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabins because I have stayed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> tents many times in my childhood. The most exciting offer is your activities. I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing. My <NS type="RP"><i>grand father</i><c>grandfather</c></NS> used to do it when he was a student. After he <NS type="TV"><i>has got</i><c>got</c></NS> a job, he became busy. However, he retired <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> his job last year so he has had his own time. If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my <NS type="RP"><i>grand father</i><c>grandfather</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would prefer to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it's when my vacations start. I could even think about <NS type="S"><i>skyping's</i><c>skipping</c></NS> school. July is also good because the <NS type="S"><i>wethear</i><c>weather</c></NS> is warm and I could <NS type="FV"><i>enjoyed</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>mor</i><c>more</c></NS> the time that I will spend in the camp</i><c>the time I will spend in the camp more</c></NS>. I would prefer <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>tends</i><c>tents</c></NS></i><c>tent</c></NS> because I'll be in touch with <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature and I could listen <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the sounds of the night. The two activities that I've chosen are Climbing and Photography. I've already climbed for four months on walls, indoor climbing. I think I can <NS type="S"><i>handde</i><c>handle</c></NS> it very well. I've <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> Photography because I love to take pictures! I've never <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>chose</i><c>chosen</c></NS></i><c>taken</c></NS> any classes or training but I think I can take very good pictures. I would like to learn more about developing films.</p>
<p>. if I have to take <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> special <NS type="S"><i>equipement</i><c>equipment</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the activities that I've chosen</p>
<p>Dear Manager: I am Angela Ounis and I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', London's newest and best musical show. I am very <NS type="RJ"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>by</c></NS> this evening's show. First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>stars</c></NS> that <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> supposed to be <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was so enthusiastic about your <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>stars</c></NS>, when I realized <NS type="R"><i>was a failure</i><c>they had been replaced</c></NS>, even though <NS type="R"><i>they</i><c>the replacements</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>did</c></NS></i><c>were</c></NS> good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> at 19:15<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> cannot be possible that a schedule for a show <NS type="MV"><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>have had a big change</i><c>be changed that much</c></NS>. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait <NS type="RP"><i>forever</i><c>for ever</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>what</c></NS> you want. Also <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was said that Discounts <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be available, but I didn't <NS type="TV"><i>received</i><c>receive</c></NS> any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big <NS type="S"><i>responsability</i><c>responsibility</c></NS> but if you <NS type="TV"><i>told</i><c>have told</c></NS> something to people, <NS type="R"><i>do</i><c>stick to</c></NS> it. <NS type="ID"><i>On the other hand</i><c>Also</c></NS>, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the <NS type="RN">schedule's organization</NS>. That was so <NS type="RJ"><i>uncomfortable</i><c>unpleasant</c></NS>, people <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> starving. I am so disappointed with this<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I am <NS type="ID"><i>in all my right</i><c>within my rights</c></NS> to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't <NS type="MA"><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> expected. Please let me know <NS type="M"></NS>. sincerely yours</p>
<p>I arrived there <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> time, 19:15<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected. I hadn't <NS type="S"><i>tought</i><c>thought</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should <NS type="FV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to be</i><c>been</c></NS> a luxury restaurant where I could eat. But it was closed because it was under construction.</p>
<p>First of all, we would like to say <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> thank you very much for <NS type="FV"><i>organised</i><c>organising</c></NS> our tour around London and our programme<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> is considered <NS type="W"><i>for us especially good</i><c>especially good for us</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> the places we will visit.</p>
<p>We think that it could be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great opportunity because in one day we can see <NS type="RP"><i>every thing</i><c>everything</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>concerning</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>fashion</i><c>fashionable</c></NS> clothes, new <NS type="S"><i>makes up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and <NS type="S"><i>hayrstyles</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS>. Furthermore <NS type="AS"><i>is student free</i><c>it is free for students</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would prefer <NS type="FV"><i>sleep</i><c>to sleep</c></NS> in a tent. I <NS type="TV"><i>am going</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>every year camping</i><c>camping every year</c></NS> in the countryside of France. The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing. I have never sailed but I am a <NS type="RJ"><i>well</i><c>good</c></NS> swimmer. Last summer I took a <NS type="W"><i>course <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> one week in Switzerland <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> climbing</i><c>climbing course for one week in Switzerland</c></NS> so I <NS type="R"><i>have good knowledge of</i><c>know a lot about</c></NS> this sport.</p>
<p>A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS> because <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> lots of people <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> don't go to work <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS> and <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the only day off <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the majority of people. If you don't get up <NS type="W"><i>enough early</i><c>early enough</c></NS> you can't find a parking <NS type="MN"><c>space</c></NS> in the town centre<NS type="RP"><i>, all</i><c>.  All</c></NS> of them are full <NS type="RT"><i>before</i><c>by</c></NS> 11 am. <NS type="UT"><i>In the</i><c>The</c></NS> street is so crowded that you can't walk like <NS type="R"><i>usually</i><c>you usually do</c></NS> and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will <NS type="TV"><i>lost</i><c>lose</c></NS> them.</p>
<p>Why not <NS type="RV"><i>buy</i><c>shop</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> or if you have a nice mother at home <NS type="R">enjoy this time</NS> because shopping is like <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> the jungle.</p>
<p>The reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my letter<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is that our class would like to suggest a few changes <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> our programme <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme.</p>
<p>First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>made</c></NS> organising <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Tuesday March 14<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we could change the time <NS type="R"><i>of</i><c>when we</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Science Museum, and <NS type="U"><i>(we)</i></NS> go <NS type="W"><i>earlier to the Museum</i><c>to the Museum earlier</c></NS>, <NS type="R"><i>such as</i><c>perhaps at</c></NS> half past eight <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the morning, so we could go <NS type="RY"><i>after</i><c>later</c></NS>, at ten o'clock<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts <NS type="S"><i>til</i><c>till</c></NS> seven o'clock <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the evening. And we <NS type="TV"><i>have thought</i><c>thought</c></NS> that we could go shopping the next day, because we <NS type="X"><i>do not have nothing</i><c>do not have anything</c></NS> to do on that afternoon.</p>
<p>In the future, our homes will <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>incorporate</c></NS> the most advanced technologies. <NS type="FN"><i>Computer</i><c>Computers</c></NS> will <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>play</c></NS> <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>via</c></NS> the computer we <NS type="TV"><i>would buy</i><c>will be able to buy</c></NS> whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our computer. We won't have <NS type="RQ"><i>the</i><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>necessity</i><c>need</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>going out</i><c>leaving</c></NS></i><c>to leave</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>from</i></NS> home, because <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer will give us everything.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the future home our <NS type="ID"><i>conditions of life</i><c>living conditions</c></NS> will <NS type="RV"><i>approve</i><c>improve</c></NS>, and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer will be very important for us, but <NS type="SX"><i>is</i><c>it</c></NS> won't control us, because we still have the most important thing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> a home <NS type="R">= have</NS><NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> will be the same as now.</p>
<p>I received your letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I <NS type="S"><i>apreicate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> and I thank you <NS type="RY"><i>a lot</i><c>sincerely</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>that you</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>have</i><c>having</c></NS> chosen me as a winner. I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>acxepted</i><c>accepted</c></NS></i><c>accept</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> and I want to inform you that I can travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have booked my <NS type="S"><i>anual</i><c>annual</c></NS> leave <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> that period. Also, I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood. Every <NS type="AGN"><i>years</i><c>year</c></NS> my parents used to <NS type="FV"><i>sent</i><c>send</c></NS> me <NS type="U"><i>for holidays</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> Camps <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same <NS type="MN"><c>type of</c></NS> accommodation<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and environment. Also, I prefer swimming and painting. I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old. My parents <NS type="RV"><i>brought</i><c>took</c></NS> me to the <NS type="RP"><i>sea side</i><c>seaside</c></NS> every weekend so I <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>got</c></NS> used to <NS type="FV"><i>be</i><c>being</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>inside</i><c>in</c></NS> the water all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> seasons. I have taken part in races twice in my life, where I was successful. Also, I <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>have liked</c></NS> painting from <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>young</i><c>early</c></NS> age, and I have taken part in a public exhibition, where I won <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> first prize. I would like to ask how much money I should have with me<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> where can I keep <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS>? What about the clothes<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>? You</c></NS> don't mention anything <NS type="M"><c>about them</c></NS>. Do I need something special or <NS type="M"><c>can I wear</c></NS> ordinary clothes?</p>
<p>I am a member <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized <NS type="U"><i>in the</i></NS> last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the <NS type="S"><i>bads</i><c>bands</c></NS> and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I <NS type="RV"><i>assisted</i><c>helped</c></NS> them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to <NS type="DV"><i>testifite</i><c>test</c></NS> the speakers and the microphones. <NS type="RT"><i>Unless</i><c>Apart from</c></NS> this preparation, I also <NS type="RV"><i>took part</i><c>helped out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>during</c></NS> the concert. I helped them to <NS type="MV"></NS> the music and <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the songs. It was <NS type="W"><i>a quite</i><c>quite a</c></NS> difficult <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>assiment</i><c>assignment</c></NS></i><c>job</c></NS> but I got <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> very good experience. I <NS type="RV"><i>understood</i><c>realised</c></NS> it when the concert had finished. The <NS type="S"><i>audients</i><c>audience</c></NS> was excited and I cannot <NS type="S"><i>discribe</i><c>describe</c></NS> my <NS type="DN"><i>happyness</i><c>happiness</c></NS>. It was <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS> that I didn't expect. Also, it <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>happen</i><c>happened</c></NS></i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were <NS type="S"><i>accompaning</i><c>accompanying</c></NS> our songs. I enjoyed <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> very much and I want to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>tranfere</i><c>transfer</c></NS></i><c>convey</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>enjoyment</i><c>pleasure</c></NS> to you <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>through</c></NS> this letter.</p>
<p>I am writing to you to give <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> some <NS type="S"><i>requiered</i><c>required</c></NS> information. First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition. I am happy to visit the United States <NS type="RT"><i>under</i><c>with</c></NS> your organisation.</p>
<p>Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two <NS type="MP"><i>weeks</i><c>weeks'</c></NS> holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>. My experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> camping is not so huge <NS type="M"><c>as to encourage me</c></NS> to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> for 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I was a little bit disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> their attitude. They didn't really appreciate <NS type="R"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience. <NS type="UA"><i>Whatever, if</i><c> If</c></NS> you ever <NS type="TV"><i>will have</i><c>have</c></NS> the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked <NS type="FV"><i>to see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> their way of life.</p>
<p>Secondly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> late start<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait <NS type="RP"><i>out side</i><c>outside</c></NS> for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing <NS type="RP"><i>out side</i><c>outside</c></NS> and I got <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> horrible cold <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> that.</p>
<p>But what about 100 <NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS> later? I expect human <NS type="L"><i><NS type="FN"><i>being'll</i><c>beings'll</c></NS></i><c>beings will</c></NS> live <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> other planets and <NS type="S"><i>trevel</i><c>travel</c></NS> around under <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> sea.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN <NS type="RT"><i>FOR</i><c>ABOUT</c></NS> THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE.</p>
<p>FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE BROCHURE. IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG!</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS. THIS WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS FOR HIM. SO MANY <NS type="AGN"><i>TIME</i><c>TIMES</c></NS> HE WAS TOLD: "PAT<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>WILL</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>SAY</i><c>TELL</c></NS> THIS SECRET ONLY TO YOU". PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> FEW DAYS, AFTER <NS type="MA"><c>WHICH</c></NS> THE SECRET <NS type="TV"><i>COME</i><c>CAME</c></NS> FROM <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID. THIS WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIS <NS type="FN"><i>FRIENDSHIP</i><c>FRIENDSHIPS</c></NS>: HE ALWAYS LOST HIS FRIENDS. HE WANTED TO DIE <NS type="RT"><i>FOR</i><c>BECAUSE OF</c></NS> THIS. THE WORST THING <NS type="TV"><i>IS</i><c>WAS</c></NS> THAT HE COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS BEHAVIOUR. ONE DAY <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> FORTUNE HELPED OUR POOR PAT. ON THE BUS HE SAW A <NS type="RN"><i>ROBBER</i><c>THIEF</c></NS> WHILE HE WAS STEALING A WALLET, HE WANTED TO SCREAM, BUT HE WAS ASTONISHED. WHEN THE ROBBER <NS type="RV"><i>UNDERSTOOD</i><c>REALISED</c></NS> HE COULD BE DISCOVERED <NS type="MC"><c>AND</c></NS> HE SAID<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "IF YOU DON'T KEEP <NS type="RD"><i>THE</i><c>THIS</c></NS> SECRET I WILL KILL YOU". PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED. EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS <NS type="DN"><i>BRAVE</i><c>BRAVERY</c></NS> AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS.</p>
<p>Dear sir, I'm writing to express my <NS type="RN"><i>complaint</i><c>displeasure</c></NS> about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, <NS type="W"><i>there should have been Danny Brook</i><c>Danny Brook should have been there</c></NS>, starring <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> all the scenes. Instead, you changed <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> actor without any warning, so I didn't <NS type="RV"><i>find</i><c>see</c></NS> my favourite Danny Brook, <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>which was a</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't <NS type="ID"><i>catch him up</i><c>match him</c></NS> at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>should</c></NS> have a right <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>one</c></NS>. <NS type="ID"><i>At the top of everything</i><c>On top of everything</c></NS>, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>restructurated</i><c>restructured</c></NS></i><c>repaired</c></NS>, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the <NS type="FN"><i>troubles</i><c>trouble</c></NS> you caused me. Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Most people think modern technologies aren't <NS type="RT"><i>so</i><c>as</c></NS> positive as they are often <NS type="RV"><i>showed</i><c>presented</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Then, surfing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> your advertisement, you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>Also, the times printed <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available.</p>
<p>However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she <NS type="TV"><i>heard</i><c>had heard</c></NS> about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> anyone. Ever since, she <NS type="RV"><i>gained</i><c>has had</c></NS> my trust and <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>told</i><c>have told</c></NS> her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.</p>
<p>Almost everyone hates other people <NS type="FV"><i>gossip</i><c>gossiping</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> their private <NS type="RN"><i>things</i><c>lives</c></NS>. It's a natural <NS type="S"><i>reaccion</i><c>reaction</c></NS> to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping <NS type="M"><c>about you</c></NS> and <NS type="R">bothering your personal thoughts</NS>. So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or <NS type="FN"><i>films</i><c>film</c></NS> stars<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> don't deserve <NS type="FV"><i>being</i><c>to be</c></NS> followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time.</p>
<p>I saw your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> your show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to <NS type="RV"><i>speak</i><c>talk</c></NS> about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="SA"><i>kilometer</i><c>kilometre</c></NS></i><c>kilometres</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>distance</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> Earth and <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>then</c></NS> I was so ashamed because I have been <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>her</c></NS> boyfriend since I <NS type="TV"><i>have came</i><c>came</c></NS> to Earth.</p>
<p>I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to you because <NS type="TV"><i>I've been</i><c>I went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts. <NS type="R"><i>As well</i><c>Also</c></NS>, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you for the next festival.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the idea<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I think that <NS type="W"><i><NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> very important the development of the arts</i><c>the development of the arts is very important</c></NS> and that everybody could <NS type="RV"><i>assist</i><c>attend</c></NS> without paying too much. Having <NS type="RQ"><i>a</i><c>one</c></NS> ticket for all the events is a great method because it's <NS type="RJ">an organised</NS> way of paying and you <NS type="RV"><i>win</i><c>save</c></NS> time.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the letter <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is asking</i><c>ask</c></NS> when I would like to go<NS type="RP"><i>?</i><c>.</c></NS> The most suitable month is July<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> my pen friend is going to visit me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> June. Also I <NS type="R">prefer the Camp California</NS> because I have just <NS type="TV"><i>finish</i><c>finished</c></NS> my military service and I got <NS type="TV"><i>use</i><c>used</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS></i><c>staying</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>campus</i><c>camp</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="SX"><i>Their</i><c>There</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> two activities. I am good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Basketball and <NS type="S"><i>tenis</i><c>tennis</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>was playing</i><c>played</c></NS> Basketball <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> university. <NS type="RT"><i>During</i><c>At</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> university I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>atend</i><c>attend</c></NS></i><c>attended</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>for two years <NS type="S"><i>tenis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> lessons</i><c>tennis lessons for two years</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Finaly</i><c>Finally</c></NS> I would like to ask you<NS type="UP"><i>. If</i><c> if</c></NS> I need to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>bring</c></NS> money and clothes with me.</p>
<p>I am looking <NS type="MY"><c>forward</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>hear</i><c>hearing</c></NS> the <NS type="IN"><i>new</i><c>news</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>yours</i><c>your</c></NS> group. <NS type="ID"><i>I hope all the best for you</i><c>I wish you all the best</c></NS>!</p>
<p>Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because of the exams I have <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> May. <NS type="R"><i>Apart from that</i><c>Also</c></NS> I would not be able to travel there until the end of June.</p>
<p>Everything was all right during the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="DN"><i>perform</i><c>performance</c></NS> of the band</i><c>band's performance</c></NS>, but at the end some <NS type="S"><i>espectators</i><c>spectators</c></NS> came up <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage and <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>did</c></NS> some damage to the band's <NS type="FN"><i>instrument</i><c>instruments</c></NS>. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they <NS type="RV"><i>went out</i><c>left</c></NS> immediately<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> leaving the public without the last part of the show.</p>
<p>As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> both <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> I helped <NS type="FV"><i>carrying</i><c>carry</c></NS> things - were appropriate for the concert. <NS type="R"><i><NS type="S"><i>Althought</i><c>Although</c></NS></i><c>Despite</c></NS> all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the <NS type="FJ"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> experience I've ever had.</p>
<p>Firstly, it was written <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> that there would be stars and <NS type="FN"><i>artist</i><c>artists</c></NS> from around the world<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were <NS type="AGN"><i>artist</i><c>artists</c></NS> from only six countries and in my opinion there</p>
<p>Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was <NS type="S"><i>excelent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> because it attracted <NS type="RP"><i>peoples'</i><c>people's</c></NS> attention<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>I would like <NS type="FV"><i>travel</i><c>to travel</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I am going to finish <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> college at the end of June and I will work <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> the first of <NS type="RP"><i>august</i><c>August</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, I would prefer a log cabin<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I think that will be <NS type="IJ"><i>more safety</i><c>safer</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> all my <NS type="L"><i>stuff</i><c>things</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm very keen to have the chance to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>take part in</c></NS> some activities<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I'm very <NS type="R"><i>attracted by</i><c>interested in</c></NS> the golf. I will be a beginner because I've never done this sport before but I will have a try. Also, I choose surfing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I love this sport. I've been <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="SA"><i>practicing</i><c>practising</c></NS></i><c>doing</c></NS> this sport <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>for</c></NS> 5 years, so I'm <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> good.</p>
<p>Thank you for your last letter<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>I'm</i><c>I</c></NS> really envy you <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> holiday <NS type="RT"><i>under</i><c>in</c></NS> the sun.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>keep</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very good <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>souvenir</i><c>memory</c></NS></i><c>memories</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> this experience. I think I will go back <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> next year.</p>
<p>Third point, your advertisement told <NS type="MA"><c>us</c></NS> about <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> "discount available" <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>ticket's price</i><c>price of the ticket</c></NS> but <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> wasn't <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Well, as you see<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it wasn't a "perfect evening out!" and I think that you could give <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me some money back because I really have the impression that your advertisement is wrong. I'm waiting <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>news</i><c>reply</c></NS>,</p>
<p>This little <NS type="RN"><i>paragraph</i><c>essay</c></NS> shows that I depend <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> technology and, <NS type="RP"><i>more over</i><c>moreover</c></NS>, because I'm in an electronic <NS type="S"><i>eegenering</i><c>engineering</c></NS> school, I'm keen on technology.</p>
<p>I am writing to thank you for the good programme, especially <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> Wednesday, because the other <NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> and I like <NS type="RP"><i>Art</i><c>art</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Galleries</i><c>galleries</c></NS>.</p>
<p>We <NS type="RV"><i>lived</i><c>stayed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> my aunt's house <NS type="RA"><i>who</i><c>which</c></NS> was in the <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> a house with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> famous French singer's house.</p>
<p>Firstly, <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>when</c></NS> I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. <NS type="W"><i>Not only the play</i><c>The play not only</c></NS> started 45 minutes after it was planned, but <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>when</c></NS> the actors eventually appeared <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage, <NS type="AS"><i>have I also seen</i><c>I also saw</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that Danny Brook <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>had been</c></NS> replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information <NS type="MV"><c>being</c></NS> given about the reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>it's</i><c>its</c></NS> closure.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought of <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> year 2100? Do you think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> world will be different from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>current</i><c>present-day</c></NS> world then? I would answer "yes" <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> both questions. And if I were asked, <NS type="MP"><i>what</i><c>"What</c></NS> will be completely different in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> year 2100,<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> I would say: clothes.</p>
<p>Secondly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the plays and films were very <NS type="DY"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS> organized <NS type="S"><i>despide</i><c>despite</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>being</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>short</i><c>low</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>number</i><c>numbers</c></NS>. I suggest <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>do</c></NS></i><c>organise</c></NS> a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new <NS type="RP"><i>life style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS> and society<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> was <NS type="DY"><i>totaly</i><c>totally</c></NS> different from ours. The talks by writers were very <NS type="S"><i>tecnic</i><c>technical</c></NS> but <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> could be understood by all the people who were <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>In conclusion, I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>impresed</i><c>impressed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price <NS type="TV"><i>has been</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>excelent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> because there wasn't any <NS type="W"><i>limit of <NS type="RN"><i>hours</i><c>time</c></NS></i><c>time limit</c></NS>.</p>
<p>At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> my <NS type="RP"><i>parent's</i><c>parents'</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>time table</i><c>timetable</c></NS>. I can go out at night once a week if I tell them <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> I'm going to be. <NS type="R"><i>In case</i><c>If</c></NS> I lie <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> them or don't explain <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> plans that my friends and I have I <NS type="R"><i>want</i><c>won't</c></NS> be able to go out<NS type="RP"><i>. <NS type="R"><i>As well</i><c>And</c></NS></i><c>, and</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>will have</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>responsability</i><c>responsibility</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to look</i><c>looking</c></NS> after my brother <NS type="R"><i>in case</i><c>when</c></NS> they aren't at home.</p>
<p>I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has <NS type="R"><i>accepted</i><c>allowed me to take</c></NS> my holidays <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible.</p>
<p>We arrived at the stadium the <NS type="R"><i>previous evening</i><c>evening before</c></NS>. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> anything they needed <NS type="MV"><c>done</c></NS>. Firstly, we were asked to <NS type="RV"><i>clear</i><c>clean</c></NS> the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished <NS type="RV"><i>clearing</i><c>cleaning</c></NS>, some of us offered <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>help</i><c>to help</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>enter</i><c>bring</c></NS> the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>scenary</i><c>scenery</c></NS></i><c>stage</c></NS> was being prepared for the concert.</p>
<p>And then, when <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everything</c></NS> was <NS type="RJ"><i>prepared</i><c>ready</c></NS>, Celine appeared <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>scenary</i><c>scenery</c></NS></i><c>stage</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>some</i><c>a</c></NS> sound <NS type="RN"><i>tests</i><c>check</c></NS>. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the <NS type="RN"><i>tests</i><c>sound check</c></NS>, I went to meet her<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I told her I was very happy <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>staying</i><c>to stay</c></NS></i><c>to be</c></NS> there and <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>to have</c></NS> helped at the concert, and I asked her <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> an <NS type="S"><i>authograph</i><c>autograph</c></NS>. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me!</p>
<p>I am from Brazil and I recently <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>expent</i><c>spent</c></NS></i><c>had</c></NS> a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> a musical show being <NS type="RV"><i>held</i><c>put on</c></NS> at The Circle Theatre. As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the <NS type="RN"><i>play</i><c>musical</c></NS>. <NS type="R"><i>As</i><c>When</c></NS> I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not <NS type="S"><i>avaible</i><c>available</c></NS>. Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good. So I <NS type="IV"><i>sitted</i><c>sat</c></NS> in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is an unacceptable delay.</p>
<p>I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what <NS type="TV"><i>happens</i><c>has happened</c></NS> to me. When I was younger<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine.</p>
<p>All the students in my class are excited about one more thing. We saw an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Fashion And Leisure Show. It will be at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is Tuesday March 14. The show <NS type="R"><i>can be seen between</i><c>is open</c></NS> 10.00 - 19.00. This show is about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Hairstyles</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS>. One more thing about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> show is<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> it's free for students. Isn't it a <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>great</c></NS> opportunity for us?</p>
<p>All people have some difficulties <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> their <NS type="FN"><i>job</i><c>jobs</c></NS> but some <NS type="U"><i>of them</i></NS> have more than <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> others. <NS type="MD"><i>Reason</i><c>The reason</c></NS> for this<NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> <NS type="M"><c>is that</c></NS> they are famous and everybody wants to <NS type="RV"><i>learn</i><c>know</c></NS> about them.</p>
<p>Moreover<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical <NS type="TV"><i>plays</i><c>is played by</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> great Danny Brook. I must admit I'd been looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> him. In fact <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage appeared <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>compleatly</i><c>completely</c></NS> different person.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The school</i><c>School</c></NS> finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with <NS type="R"><i>plenty of</i><c>so much</c></NS> spare time. I didn't <NS type="FV"><i>wanted</i><c>want</c></NS> to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim <NS type="RV"><i>gave</i><c>made</c></NS> a <NS type="RN"><i>proposition</i><c>suggestion</c></NS> about going <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>sea</i><c>seaside</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>in</c></NS> his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. <NS type="MD"><i>Parents</i><c>Our parents</c></NS> were very pleased and happy we <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> so <NS type="S"><i>ambisious</i><c>ambitious</c></NS>. Of course<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we didn't <NS type="FV"><i>wanted</i><c>want</c></NS> to go there, it was just a "cover". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we <NS type="TV"><i>were waiting</i><c>waited</c></NS>. We promised to keep it <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> secret.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> what I saw <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find.</p>
<p>First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> this good idea. <NS type="AS"><i>It is known of all the lack of art festivals and cultural activities in general that shows our city</i><c>We all know that our city lacks art festivals and cultural activities in general</c></NS>. And what <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>belter</i><c>better</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>thing</i><c>way</c></NS> to solve this than to give the festival an international character.</p>
<p>Secondly, there were some <NS type="W"><i>problems of accommodation</i><c>accommodation problems</c></NS> in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>among</i><c>with</c></NS> most visitors of the weekend ticket</i><c>of the weekend ticket with most visitors</c></NS>, due to its economical price and because of its <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>comodity</i><c>commodity</c></NS></i><c>ease</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> use.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> ska or <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>ethnical</i><c>ethnic</c></NS></i><c>world</c></NS> music.</p>
<p>One possible thing is to display <NS type="W"><i>in a public place what you can do best</i><c>what you can do best in a public place</c></NS>, and, then, "sell" it to the people. For example, you can <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>dance folk</i><c>folk dance</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>do</c></NS> Hamlet in the street, or even sing <NS type="W"><i>with some of your friends a nice song from <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> country</i><c>a nice song from your country with some of your friends</c></NS>. You must be aware, <NS type="RY"><i>anyway</i><c>however</c></NS>, of the <NS type="FN"><i>difficulty</i><c>difficulties</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="AG"><i>this kind</i><c>these kinds</c></NS> of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on)<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Thank you for your letter <NS type="FV"><i>to inform</i><c>informing</c></NS> me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the <NS type="SX"><i>prise</i><c>prize</c></NS> I had won.</p>
<p>I would like to answer <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, please</i><c>. Please</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>notice</i><c>note</c></NS> that I can travel only in July because only then <NS type="W"><i>I can</i><c>can I</c></NS> take holidays from my work, after the busy time <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>month</i><c>months</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> May and June.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>look</i><c>am looking</c></NS> forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>competition</i><c>holiday</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>inform</i><c>tell</c></NS> you about my experience <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the last pop concert. It was very nice for me to help because I <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> so many people and I <NS type="TV"><i>have <NS type="SA"><i><NS type="S"><i>goten</i><c>gotten</c></NS></i><c>got</c></NS></i><c>got</c></NS> a lot of experience of things that I <NS type="W"><i>never had</i><c>had never</c></NS> done before.</p>
<p>Hoping to hear <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> your decision soon.</p>
<p>On <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>audiance</i><c>audience</c></NS></i><c>public</c></NS>, and <NS type="RP"><i>soon</i><c>so on</c></NS>. Moreover, especially <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the <NS type="RP"><i>Tv</i><c>TV</c></NS> or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their <NS type="RN"><i>fame</i><c>careers</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to tell you that my class is interested in going to the show which takes place <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>central exhibition</i><c>Central Exhibition</c></NS> Hall in London <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> 14th March.</p>
<p>We have seen it in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> and I would like to go to the show. I would also like to tell you that it is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very interesting <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>event</c></NS> because it includes all the latest <NS type="FN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> leisure and sports wear <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> as well as hairstyles. It is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> great opportunity for us because the <NS type="RN">fashion</NS> is <NS type="S"><i>fashinating</i><c>fascinating</c></NS> and free.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="RY"><i>more</i><c>very</c></NS> grateful if you could change the programme so as <NS type="M"><c>to allow us</c></NS> to go to the show. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we <NS type="RV"><i>shall</i><c>would</c></NS> be able to <NS type="RP"><i>putoff</i><c>put off</c></NS> our visit <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the science museums <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>Thusday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> morning <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>till</c></NS> Wednesday afternoon. The fashion show starts at 10 <NS type="MP"><i>oclock</i><c>o'clock</c></NS> and finishes at <NS type="ID"><i>19 o'clock</i><c>7 o'clock</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The journalists</i><c>Journalists</c></NS> follow <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take <NS type="S"><i>fotos</i><c>photos</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>other</i></NS> information about them. After that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>journalist</i><c>journalists</c></NS> sell their information <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>newspaper</i><c>newspapers</c></NS> and magazines in order to earn money.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the Musical <NS type="UN"><i>Show</i></NS> 'Over the Rainbow'<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>permormed</i><c>performed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle theatre last week.</p>
<p>However, there are a lot of negative aspects <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the way that technology affects my life. As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange <NS type="W"><i>for me <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS></i><c>accommodation for me</c></NS> in log cabins as I am not used <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>living</i><c>staying</c></NS> in the countryside and especially <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> in tents.</p>
<p>I would <NS type="W"><i>be also</i><c>also be</c></NS> grateful if you could send me information about the average <NS type="W"><i>living cost</i><c>cost of living</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> California<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as I have to <NS type="RV"><i>arrange</i><c>work out</c></NS> the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need. I would <NS type="W"><i>like also</i><c>also like</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> to specify if the food is <NS type="DJ"><i>including</i><c>included</c></NS> in the prize.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to <NS type="R">take plans from a match of our school team</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the football <NS type="RN"><i>field</i><c>pitch</c></NS> as it is completely new and <NS type="DY"><i>full</i><c>fully</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>equiped</i><c>equipped</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I have to declare that <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>myself</i><c>I</c></NS> and my fellow students will be available to help <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> this short video <NS type="ID">by all means</NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course <NS type="RT"><i>a</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>University</i><c>university</c></NS> at the end of June and I will start to work in September.</p>
<p>Since this stay at Camp California is a good <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>discover</i><c>try out</c></NS> new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> both activities.</p>
<p>I'm writing concerning your letter about my <NS type="RN"><i>win</i><c>winning</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>in your competition <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> two weeks at Camp California</i><c>two weeks at Camp California in your competition</c></NS>. I'm very happy to be the winner <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> your competition.</p>
<p>Because I'm working in an <NS type="MP"><i>accountant</i><c>accountant's</c></NS> office, I'm very busy. The only month I could go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> is July, when we haven't got a lot to do.</p>
<p>Moreover, <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>concerning</c></NS> the accommodation, I would like to be in a tent, because I want to spend my holidays <NS type="R">different than usually</NS>. And in my opinion, when you <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>sleep</c></NS> in a tent, you <NS type="R">have more from the nature and the adventure</NS>.</p>
<p>I like a lot <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> your list <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> possibilities<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I will choose swimming. I <NS type="TV"><i>used to be</i><c>was</c></NS> a member <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> a swimming club for about 10 years. Additionally I'm keen on taking pictures. But <NS type="RY"><i>until now</i><c>so far</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>only took</i><c>have only taken</c></NS> pictures on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> and <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> some family <NS type="S"><i>celabrations</i><c>celebrations</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the English class. All my <NS type="RP"><i>class mates</i><c>classmates</c></NS> are looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> to London. Thank you so much for organising such a great <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Have you stayed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a park during the night?</p>
<p>I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry <NS type="S"><i>blossam</i><c>blossom</c></NS> tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the <NS type="RP"><i>moon light</i><c>moonlight</c></NS> helped me to see <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> things. I was regretting <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>risked</i><c>having risked</c></NS> staying <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the park alone.</p>
<p>Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We <NS type="TV"><i>are using</i><c>use</c></NS> mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every <NS type="RN"><i>section</i><c>area</c></NS> of our lives. We also have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>"</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>"</i></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.</p>
<p>Modern technology is very important for all the countries. It has a very big role in developing a country. When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> everything.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that you will succeed <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> next year's festival.</p>
<p>The best advantage of this job is the <NS type="RN"><i>payment</i><c>pay</c></NS>. It is very good considering how <NS type="RJ"><i>less</i><c>little</c></NS> time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home <NS type="RN"><i>teachers</i><c>tutors</c></NS> are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> means they take lessons after school, not in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> daytime. So, in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> daytime, we can focus <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our <NS type="DN"><i>studyings</i><c>studies</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like first, <NS type="RT"><i>in the name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London.</p>
<p>We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, <NS type="SX"><i>them</i><c>then</c></NS>! ... <NS type="RP"><i>well</i><c>Well</c></NS> actually we've <NS type="SX"><i>must</i><c>just</c></NS> received an <NS type="RN">advertisement</NS> for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we <NS type="RY">quite</NS> don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>entrance</i><c>admission</c></NS> is free for the students so that won't raise the cost <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind!</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I have some <NS type="AGN"><i>suggestion</i><c>suggestions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> next <NS type="MP"><i>year</i><c>year's</c></NS> festival, and if it is possible I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>like</c></NS></i><c>would like</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> you some opinions about this <NS type="MP"><i>year</i><c>year's</c></NS> festival.</p>
<p>The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>weekend-price</i><c>weekend <NS type="RN"><i>price</i><c>ticket</c></NS></c></NS>. This is <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> whole family at the weekend and see all events <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>reasonaby-price</i><c>reasonable-price</c></NS></i><c>reasonable price</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Thank you for your letter, and I'm sorry I <NS type="TV"><i>didn't write</i><c>haven't written</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>have had</c></NS> examinations, but now I have plenty of time and I can write a letter to you. In your letter you ask me about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> rules <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> school and home I have</i><c>I have at school and home</c></NS>. I think that they are the same as yours, but I'm not <NS type="W"><i>sure <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> 100 per cent</i><c>100 per cent sure</c></NS> so I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>vrite</i><c>write</c></NS></i><c>am writing</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>this letter</c></NS>:</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Rules</i><c>rules</c></NS> at school are: we must be on time <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>for</c></NS> lessons, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>always <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>must</c></NS></i><c>must always</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> homework. Everybody must be present at lessons. If someone is ill<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> must bring a <NS type="RN"><i>paper</i><c>note</c></NS> from a doctor. And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> teachers<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> At home I must clean my room and <NS type="FV"><i>vacuuming</i><c>vacuum</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> home. I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows. I like <NS type="FV"><i>clean</i><c>cleaning</c></NS> my home, and I like <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> is clean and fresh. However I'm the only child and I don't have <NS type="FV"><i>do</i><c>to do</c></NS> too much but I want <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> and I like it. There is one thing I <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>would like</c></NS> to change, <NS type="M"><c>and that is</c></NS> the treatment students <NS type="MV"><c>receive</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> teachers. They want too much <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS><NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> and are <NS type="DJ"><i>unkindly</i><c>unkind</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> them.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me much, but I'm quite good at <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS>. I like surfing and playing tennis, <NS type="M"><c>and sports</c></NS> such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, Tim and <NS type="FA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> spent the hours before the <NS type="S"><i>concer</i><c>concert</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>laying</i><c>lying</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the park next to the <NS type="DN"><i>sport hall</i><c>sports hall</c></NS> where the concert was to be held.</p>
<p>I would <NS type="W"><i>enjoy <NS type="RY"><i>a lot</i><c>very much</c></NS></i><c>very much enjoy</c></NS> playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it. In addition I would love to <NS type="RV"><i>follow</i><c>attend</c></NS> the photography classes <NS type="RP"><i>eventhough</i><c>even though</c></NS> I have never tried to take a picture before.</p>
<p>Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose <NS type="RP"><i>Basket ball</i><c>basketball</c></NS> and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>through</c></NS> these kinds of sports. Both could be exciting for me.</p>
<p>I would like to know more about clothes and money. I have got <NS type="DQ"><i>not</i><c>no</c></NS> idea about them. I would be grateful if you could send me some information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> them.</p>
<p>Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just <NS type="MV"><c>worked</c></NS> as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I <NS type="RY"><i>ever</i><c>always</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>seen</i><c>see</c></NS> on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> so cool. After the concert I had <NS type="UV"><i>got</i></NS> an opportunity to join them <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to <NS type="RV"><i>control</i><c>take care of</c></NS> their expensive instruments and I have sung my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> songs with them.</p>
<p>Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because I study <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> an <NS type="S"><i>ingenior's</i><c>engineer's</c></NS> school in France and in <NS type="RP"><i>Summer</i><c>summer</c></NS> we have <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> holidays <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> July.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. <NS type="RA"><i>That</i><c>This</c></NS> is a sport that <NS type="TV"><i>I always want</i><c>I have always wanted</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>play</c></NS> but in France it is <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>expansive</i><c>expensive</c></NS>. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to <NS type="RV"><i>fail</i><c>miss</c></NS> it. I would like to <NS type="R"><i>photograph</i><c>try</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>photography</c></NS> too. There are so <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> monuments in California and so I will remember <NS type="FN"><i>these holidays</i><c>this holiday</c></NS> with my <NS type="S"><i>photographies</i><c>photographs</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the next concert we will go together. I will <NS type="R"><i>give you news</i><c>keep you informed</c></NS> about it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I received last week. I was delighted to <NS type="FV"><i>heard</i><c>hear</c></NS> that I won the prize <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> two <NS type="AGN"><i>week</i><c>weeks</c></NS> at Camp California in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>How are you? I haven't heard from you for such a long time. I hope everything is alright with you. Sorry! I haven't written to you <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> last two months, because I have been very busy <NS type="FV"><i>to helped</i><c>helping</c></NS> and organizing the pop concert which took place near my town. Let me tell you more about what I <NS type="TV"><i>have done</i><c>did</c></NS> last month.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>have had</i><c>had</c></NS> a wonderful <NS type="DN"><i>experienced</i><c>experience</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>with helping</i><c>helping with</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pop concert last month. My duty was <NS type="FV"><i>helped</i><c>to help</c></NS> them <NS type="FV"><i>cooking</i><c>cook</c></NS> for all of them during the concert<NS type="RP"><i>, as</i><c>. As</c></NS> you know I'm very good at <NS type="FV"><i>cook</i><c>cooking</c></NS> and everybody loved <NS type="R">my good I cooked</NS>! Secondly, I helped them to <NS type="FV"><i>prepared</i><c>prepare</c></NS> the clothes and the <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>custom</i><c>costume</c></NS></i><c>costumes</c></NS> during the concert<NS type="RP"><i>, although</i><c>. Although</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>never <NS type="RV"><i>experience</i><c>work</c></NS></i><c>have never worked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> clothes and art before, <NS type="UC"><i>but</i></NS> I enjoyed it very much.</p>
<p>What I liked most about my <NS type="DN"><i>experienced</i><c>experience</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert was <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> great atmosphere behind the <NS type="RN"><i>state</i><c>stage</c></NS> and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> live music<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> made me <NS type="FV"><i>felt</i><c>feel</c></NS> great and happy<NS type="RP"><i>, what's</i><c>. What's</c></NS> more, I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> opportunity to meet a singer who I <NS type="TV"><i>loved</i><c>love</c></NS> and I dream about. He also gave me his <NS type="S"><i>adress</i><c>address</c></NS> and telephone number if I need help from him in the future. I'll show you when you come around to see me.</p>
<p>I saw your advertisement yesterday. I have visited the <NS type="RP"><i>circle theatre</i><c>Circle Theatre</c></NS>. I would like to say that I am not satisfied <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to mention <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> that in our daily life we always use some technological <NS type="RN"><i>machines</i><c>appliances</c></NS>. For instance, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>discovering</i><c>invention</c></NS> of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is <NS type="RJ"><i>connected to</i><c>dependent on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> computers<NS type="RP"><i>. For</i><c>, for</c></NS> example, education, <NS type="RN"><i>researching</i><c>research</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>into</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Universe</i><c>universe</c></NS> and <NS type="R"><i>others</i><c>other things</c></NS>.</p>
<p>This <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>very</c></NS> bad evening for us. We were bored <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> waiting. We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show. We were hungry after the show. But we couldn't eat <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> and we couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>use</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount.</p>
<p>I use <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> now. I don't buy <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> newspaper<NS type="RP"><i>. <NS type="S"><i>Becouse</i><c>Because</c></NS></i><c>, because</c></NS> I can read my newspaper <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. I can buy <NS type="R"><i>something</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>for</i><c>For</c></NS> example, I <NS type="TV"><i>send</i><c>sent</c></NS> a flower to my mum <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> mother's day <NS type="R">by internet order</NS>.</p>
<p>Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS> and the ways <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to <NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS></i><c>communicate</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> other people as well as our life expectancy. With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet to <NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS> with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from <NS type="RA"><i>ourselves</i><c>us</c></NS>. Despite <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> the distances, we can keep our friendship <NS type="DJ"><i>closely</i><c>close</c></NS> and <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> a <NS type="DJ"><i>cheaply</i><c>cheap</c></NS> way. Besides <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> this, the information goes faster than it used to <NS type="SX"><i>know</i><c>now</c></NS> and it's <NS type="S"><i>avaiable</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> every part of the world. On the one hand, our time is taken <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to learn</i><c>learning</c></NS> how to deal with the new technologies. On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> support <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> our hard tasks and <NS type="RV"><i>letting</i><c>setting</c></NS> us free to apply our <NS type="RN"><i>attention</i><c>intelligence</c></NS> and efforts to more important things. For instance, we can research new <NS type="RN"><i>manners</i><c>ways</c></NS> of improving our quality of life. In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> how they are introduced <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> our lives to avoid the dangerous side of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> TECHNOLOGY.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the show<NS type="UP"><i>. And</i><c> and</c></NS> I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking <NS type="MN"></NS> part. And the worst <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> was that he wasn't so good in <NS type="RD"><i>his</i><c>this</c></NS> role!</p>
<p>As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes <NS type="DY"><i>rootly</i><c>radically</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>over</c></NS> the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be <NS type="UT"><i>like</i></NS> 100 years from now</p>
<p>First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I <NS type="TV"><i>need</i><c>needed</c></NS> some time to <NS type="SX"><i>by</i><c>buy</c></NS> the tickets<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="SX"><i>by</i><c>buy</c></NS></i><c>bought</c></NS> two tickets <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> £20 and when I <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> for a discount, they didn't <NS type="AS"><i>give it to me</i><c>give me one</c></NS>, then I <NS type="TV"><i>keep</i><c>was kept</c></NS> waiting for the show to start <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> 8:15 pm.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I <NS type="AS"><i>tell something to her</i><c>tell her something</c></NS>, <NS type="RY"><i>finally</i><c>eventually</c></NS> everyone <NS type="TV"><i>knew</i><c>knows</c></NS> about it. But this time it was something more important <NS type="SX"><i>that</i><c>than</c></NS> any other time. I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling <NS type="DD"><i>me</i><c>my</c></NS> little and terrible secret to Pat, <NS type="S"><i>everithing</i><c>everything</c></NS> started going wrong<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> Katrin<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my friend, and the one I was being bad <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS>, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> know what to do<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was in love with Brett, but I <NS type="TV"><i>love</i><c>loved</c></NS> my friend too. So I <NS type="TV"><i>decide</i><c>decided</c></NS> to talk to Brett. We both decided to finish with <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> this stupid affair. It was difficult, but <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>it</c></NS> was the best for everyone. Then I decide to talk to Katrin<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was very <NS type="S"><i>sory</i><c>sorry</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> all I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>done</c></NS>, so I <NS type="TV"><i>apologize</i><c>apologised</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> her and <NS type="TV"><i>promise</i><c>promised</c></NS> her that this <NS type="UV"><i>will</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>never would</i><c>would never</c></NS> happen again. Now I'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the <NS type="SX"><i>hole</i><c>whole</c></NS> world.</p>
<p>I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> Circle <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, there was no discount <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the price of the tickets<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> for students either, contrary to what I was told <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> phone when I asked for more information.</p>
<p>Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the <NS type="SA"><i>theater's</i><c>theatre's</c></NS> restaurant. But<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> our surprise, it was <NS type="RJ"><i>out of order</i><c>closed</c></NS>. At the end of all these <NS type="RN">circumstances</NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint.</p>
<p>So, <NS type="RT"><i>due to</i><c>because of</c></NS> the things I have mentioned, I think I <NS type="S"><i>shoul</i><c>should</c></NS> be given some money back.</p>
<p>I would say that the worst thing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> this development for me is that <NS type="W"><i>more and more I experience</i><c>I experience more and more</c></NS> stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is <NS type="RY"><i>no</i><c>not</c></NS> enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life <NS type="RV"><i>passes</i><c>is</c></NS> devoted <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> my duties without <NS type="M"><c>leaving any</c></NS> time <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> pleasures.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is less <NS type="S"><i>comunication</i><c>communication</c></NS> between members of my family, because when we arrive <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> home after an <NS type="RJ"><i>exhausted</i><c>exhausting</c></NS> day racing <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>against</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> time, the only thing we want to do is <NS type="FV"><i>lying</i><c>lie</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the sofa while watching television.</p>
<p>I am writing in order to complain about the Musical <NS type="UN"><i>Show</i></NS>, OVER THE RAIN, I went to see <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Tecnology</i><c>Technology</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>change</i><c>changes</c></NS> our daily life, it makes our life <NS type="DJ"><i>easily</i><c>easy</c></NS> to live and of <NS type="S"><i>courese</i><c>course</c></NS> more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>like</i></NS> with computers, <NS type="S"><i>televitions</i><c>televisions</c></NS>, radios <NS type="RP"><i>etcetera</i><c>et cetera</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>some times</i><c>sometimes</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>more secure</i><c>safer</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like in</i><c>as with</c></NS> medicine.</p>
<p>Thank you for organising the school trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with <NS type="FJ"><i><NS type="RJ"><i>strongest</i><c>greatest</c></NS></i><c>greater</c></NS> motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>during</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>our</c></NS> free time on 15th March.</p>
<p>Secondly, <NS type="RP"><i>noone</i><c>no one</c></NS> has the right to <NS type="RV"><i>look at</i><c>snoop into</c></NS> anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> privacy.</p>
<p>In your letter you asked me when I would <NS type="DV"><i>rather</i><c>prefer</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>travel</i><c>to travel</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I will be able <NS type="MV"><c>to travel</c></NS> only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have to work and I can take some days off <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month.</p>
<p>Every woman in the world likes the word shopping. It is <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> if they lose their <NS type="S"><i>concience</i><c>conscience</c></NS> while they are shopping.</p>
<p>You can <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>go</c></NS> shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> it is that you feel that you have <NS type="R">all the power</NS> while you are buying things. <NS type="RP"><i>May be</i><c>Maybe</c></NS> it is not for you, <NS type="RP"><i>may be</i><c>maybe</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>it is</i><c>you are shopping for</c></NS> a present, but buying things<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> at least for me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is the best.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter <NS type="RT"><i>with reference to</i><c>concerning</c></NS> the competition. Here <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the information you <NS type="TV"><i>required</i><c>require</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> my school.</p>
<p>In my opinion, maths, politics, <NS type="RP"><i>chinese</i><c>Chinese</c></NS>, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English <NS type="MN"><c>people</c></NS> and other foreigners are <NS type="DY"><i>particularlly</i><c>particularly</c></NS> curious <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As far as I know, English people are really surprised <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>their</c></NS> knowledge <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> politics. This is a good <NS type="S"><i>oppertunate</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to see how they learn in class. <NS type="R">As it is expected, painting lesson is an amazing one</NS>. You can find students <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>using</c></NS> traditional <NS type="RP"><i>chinese</i><c>Chinese</c></NS> ink to draw and write.</p>
<p>I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet. I think that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for <NS type="S"><i>exemple</i><c>example</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the morning and receive <NS type="UY"><i>back</i></NS> their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet as <NS type="W"><i>a quite</i><c>quite a</c></NS> powerful tool and I believe it has given more <NS type="S"><i>strenght</i><c>strength</c></NS> to <NS type="RN"><i>relations</i><c>relationships</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>among</i><c>between</c></NS> people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>According to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> your first question, I would like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it is my school <NS type="S"><i>holliday</i><c>holiday</c></NS> so I would not miss any <NS type="AGN"><i>class</i><c>classes</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>As a regard for</i><c>As regards</c></NS> activities I would choose singing and surfing<NS type="RP"><i>, surfing</i><c>.  Surfing</c></NS> because it is my <NS type="S"><i>favourit</i><c>favourite</c></NS> sport<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> it<NS type="RP"><i>, and</i><c>.  And</c></NS> singing because I really love it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not as good <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> singing as I am <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> surfing but I like doing it.</p>
<p>As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the band called RAMONES.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>came</c></NS> back from their break <NS type="TV"><i>they've just went</i><c>they just went</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>off</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>!</c></NS></p>
<p>I received your letter and would be glad to <NS type="RV"><i>travel</i><c>spend</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July <NS type="L"><i>for</i><c>because</c></NS> in June I will be in Austria with a friend and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> August I have rented an <NS type="S"><i>appartment</i><c>apartment</c></NS> with my family.</p>
<p>I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary <NS type="RN"><i>material</i><c>equipment</c></NS> for camping. While I am at the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS> I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play <NS type="W"><i>very well tennis</i><c>tennis very well</c></NS> since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it.</p>
<p>From <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> activities which you offer <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me I choose swimming and tennis. I am very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> swimming. I <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>have done</c></NS> this sport since I was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> child and I really enjoy it. I'm not so good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> tennis but I would like to play it <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to get some</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>practise</i><c>practice</c></NS>. Also I find that <NS type="R"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS> sport is very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>usefull</i><c>useful</c></NS></i><c>good</c></NS> for my health and <NS type="RV"><i>does</i><c>makes</c></NS> me feel better. <NS type="R">It is all about me</NS>.</p>
<p>I think the people who <NS type="TV"><i>are enjoying</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> shopping <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> are <NS type="S"><i>greede</i><c>greedy</c></NS> for materialistic things and they <NS type="S"><i>havn't</i><c>haven't</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> interests <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> spirit (?), <NS type="M"><c>in the</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>intelect</i><c>intellect</c></NS></i><c>intellectual</c></NS> life. They are <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>loosing</i><c>losing</c></NS></i><c>wasting</c></NS> time <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> more interesting <NS type="W"><i>than shopping things</i><c>things than shopping</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like sport, reading, <NS type="IV"><i>chating</i><c>chatting</c></NS> about ideas which make our lives better. We must do something <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>help</i><c>to help</c></NS> other people to feel better and <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>usefull</i><c>useful</c></NS>.</p>
<p>For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> this sport, because I played tennis <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in <NS type="R"><i>them</i><c>those activities</c></NS>. I came second <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> photography classes. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the camp I can practise them <NS type="RP"><i>alot</i><c>a lot</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Considering</c></NS> the advertisement, which appeared in one of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> London's newspapers, I would like to present you <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> some of my <NS type="S"><i>complaines</i><c>complaints</c></NS> about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you "<NS type="RV"><i>offered</i><c>advertised</c></NS>"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> has been changed. The man who played the main male role was <NS type="R"><i>different than this one,</i><c>not the one</c></NS> who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start <NS type="TV"><i>has been</i><c>was</c></NS> changed, <NS type="RV"><i>making your show delayed</i><c>delaying your show</c></NS> for <NS type="DY"><i>nearlly</i><c>nearly</c></NS> one hour! In your <NS type="RN"><i>offer</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> I noticed <NS type="CQ"><i>an</i><c>some</c></NS> information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another "defect" in the advertisement was an "invitation" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown <NS type="U"><i>for me</i></NS> reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information <NS type="RV"><i>telling</i><c>giving</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> a <NS type="RN"><i>cause</i><c>reason</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> closing it). Finally, you guaranteed "a perfect evening out", but for me it was the worst visit <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre in two years <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS>.</p>
<p>In my opinion<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet <NS type="AGA"><i>her</i><c>it</c></NS> "at every corner": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my <NS type="UP"><i>life-style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> washing machine which makes my clothes clean again. <NS type="RY"><i>Recently</i><c>Today</c></NS>, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, super-fast cars etc. These improvements <NS type="AGV"><i>helps</i><c>help</c></NS> me with my ordinary <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="IN"><i>dutes</i><c>duties</c></NS></i><c>chores</c></NS>. I can do my homework on <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> computer, prepare for the class test by searching <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> information <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet and use a mobile phone every time <NS type="UC"><i>when</i></NS> I want to <NS type="RV"><i>connect</i><c>talk</c></NS> with one of my parents.</p>
<p>However, technology has a bad influence on us<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> generally on our <NS type="S"><i>healf</i><c>health</c></NS>. <NS type="MD"><i>Couple</i><c>A couple</c></NS> of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones <NS type="R">make a possibility of getting sick with cancer</NS>. Also fast and <NS type="DJ"><i>well-improved</i><c>high-tech</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>car</i><c>cars</c></NS> increase <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>risk</i><c>risks</c></NS> of pollution <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation, I would prefer staying in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to <NS type="S"><i>choise</i><c>choose</c></NS> two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>do</c></NS> this sport with my village club <NS type="R">for five years</NS> and <NS type="RV"><i>earned</i><c>won</c></NS> a few competitions. Secondly, I am very <NS type="RJ"><i>interesting</i><c>interested</c></NS> in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time <NS type="R"><i>each other</i><c>together</c></NS>. We had a lot of fun during our last <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> and we took a lot of pictures. As <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> instructions about clothes and money were not <NS type="RJ"><i>enclosed</i><c>included</c></NS> in your letter, <NS type="R">I request about it and ask you to include in it</NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I <NS type="TV"><i>have had</i><c>had</c></NS> no discount <NS type="R"><i>at</i><c>when I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>paying</i><c>paid</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>secondly</i><c>Secondly</c></NS> there was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> delay which got me into trouble<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> After the show I couldn't catch my train. Because I didn't have any plan I decided to have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> lunch in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre restaurant. But it was closed. The worst thing is that I couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>watch</i><c>see</c></NS> my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor. I was so <NS type="S"><i>dissapointted</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> that. I couldn't <NS type="S"><i>consentrate</i><c>concentrate</c></NS> on the play any more.</p>
<p>Nowadays students have <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> more <NS type="IN"><i>facilitis</i><c>facilities</c></NS> in education than before. Although in those days the only way of learning was reading. These days we can use <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> computer, television and some sophisticated equipment<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> which were <NS type="DJ"><i>unusuall</i><c>unusual</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>once</c></NS>. <NS type="SX"><i>Than</i><c>Then</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> technology we can reach any place in the world easily. We can get <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> information more quickly. Technology has a huge effect on our <NS type="MP"><i>spare time</i><c>spare-time</c></NS> activities as well. Children play <NS type="SX"><i>wit</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS> instead of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>usuall</i><c>usual</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>plays</i><c>toys</c></NS>.</p>
<p>And last, but not least<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, <NS type="FV"><i>show</i><c>showing</c></NS> their real feelings to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> their lives.</p>
<p>What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think <NS type="S"><i>modles</i><c>models</c></NS> will wear <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>cat walks</i><c>catwalks</c></NS>? Will they wear anything? Who <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS>? <NS type="S"><i>Nowaday</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS>, people look at <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="S"><i>fashion-magesins</i><c>fashion-magazines</c></NS></i><c>fashion magazines</c></NS> or get opinions from their friends <NS type="M"><c>to help them</c></NS> to decide what to wear <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> different occasions<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In my opinion, I think</i><c>In my opinion,</c></NS> clothes will be a lot <NS type="S"><i>differente</i><c>different</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> 100 <NS type="MP"><i>years</i><c>years'</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>later compare to now</i><c>time</c></NS>. <NS type="UC"><i>As new</i><c>New</c></NS> materials <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>invented</c></NS> and new styles <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>will be</c></NS> created either by designers or people themselves<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>leads</i><c>lead</c></NS></i><c>will lead</c></NS> to changes in fashion<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but <NS type="ID"><i>on the other hand</i><c>in addition</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>come</i></NS> materials will probably still be used such as <NS type="RN"><i>jeans</i><c>denim</c></NS>, which was invented ages ago in America. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> people nowadays still use <NS type="RN"><i>jeans</i><c>denim</c></NS> <NS type="R">as a common material</NS>. If you walk out <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>jeans</i><c>denim</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is incredibly surprising!</p>

<p>For the activities, I chose climbing because I took <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>cours</i><c>course</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level <NS type="M"><c>of proficiency</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, for</i><c>.

<p>My second <NS type="MN"><c>job</c></NS> was to take the money <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> the bars and to <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a little room where I could see the <NS type="FN"><i>pop star</i><c>pop stars</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>walked</i><c>walking</c></NS> in the corridor.

<p>I would like to do <NS type="S"><i>photografy</i><c>photography</c></NS> and swimming.

<p>I'm looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> hearing from you,</p>

<p>Hi! How are you doing? I had a wonderful time last month. I helped <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> a pop concert as a <NS type="RN"><i>charity</i><c>volunteer</c></NS>. My jobs were collecting <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>ticket</i><c>tickets</c></NS>, <NS type="DV"><i>saling</i><c>selling</c></NS> goods and <NS type="FN"><i>refreshment</i><c>refreshments</c></NS>, guiding people to <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> right seat and cleaning up the concert <NS type="RN"><i>hole</i><c>hall</c></NS> after <NS type="W"><i><NS type="TV"><i>finish</i><c>finished</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> concert</i><c>the concert finished</c></NS>. I wasn't allowed to help <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> heavy work, even though I wanted to <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS>, because I'm <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> woman. What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>achived</i><c>achieved</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>through</c></NS> our <NS type="CN"><i>supports</i><c>support</c></NS>. It seemed that all people, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> audience, the band and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>stuffs</i><c>staff</c></NS> were delightful. If I have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> chance, I want to help <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> a concert again. I have never felt such <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> satisfaction. I really <NS type="S"><i>recomend</i><c>recommend</c></NS> you to help them, I think this is a good <NS type="S"><i>oppotunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> and I want you <NS type="FV"><i>understand</i><c>to understand</c></NS> my feeling well. I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS>. I want to know your <NS type="S"><i>openion</i><c>opinion</c></NS>.</p>
<p>However, we have seen an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00. The show will have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> latest fashions from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> top fashion designers in the world. <NS type="MD"><i>Leisure</i><c>The leisure</c></NS> show will have <NS type="MP"><i>leisure</i><c>leisure-</c></NS> and <NS type="MP"><i>sports wear</i><c>sports-wear</c></NS>, new <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>style</i><c>styles</c></NS> and new <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>hair style</i><c>hairstyle</c></NS></i><c>hairstyles</c></NS> for next year. The best thing is that it is free because we are students.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The politicians</i><c>Politicians</c></NS> and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. <NS type="R"><i>Although</i><c>However</c></NS>, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their <NS type="AGN"><i>story</i><c>stories</c></NS> always make them <NS type="S"><i>embarras</i><c>embarrassed</c></NS> because most of the journalists create their own story <NS type="TV"><i>base</i><c>based</c></NS> on the true story just to get <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RN"><i>attraction</i><c>attention</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> people</i><c>people's attention</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if the <NS type="AGN"><i>journalist</i><c>journalists</c></NS> want to publish the <NS type="MP"><i>politicians</i><c>politicians'</c></NS> and film <NS type="MP"><i>stars</i><c>stars'</c></NS> private <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>, they should <NS type="FV"><i>have asked</i><c>ask</c></NS> for permission. They deserve to have a private life <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> everybody <NS type="MY"><c>else</c></NS>. </p>
<p>As <NS type="U"><i>well as</i></NS> you can understand<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="DJ">nonsense</NS> thing. Therefore, if <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>avaliable</i><c>available</c></NS></i><c>possible</c></NS>, can you <NS type="RV"><i>play</i><c>pay</c></NS> my money back please? <NS type="CE">My address is here for any contacts</NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>After a week <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that <NS type="RQ"><i>every</i><c>all</c></NS> of her friends knew <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> that. She became very <NS type="RJ">shy</NS> and <NS type="S"><i>engry</i><c>angry</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> She couldn't talk with people and she <NS type="W"><i>just was</i><c>was just</c></NS> very sad.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He went to see the headmaster and told him <NS type="RQ"><i>all the</i><c>the whole</c></NS> truth. Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the <NS type="MP"><i>headmaster</i><c>headmaster's</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>back</c></NS> after he punished Jon. The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was <NS type="DN"><i>suspended</i><c>suspension</c></NS> from school for a week.</p>
<p>This happened <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster <NS type="TV"><i>would walk</i><c>walked</c></NS> round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit <NS type="UY"><i>directly</i></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster <NS type="RT"><i>among</i><c>to</c></NS> us. Pat heard that and <NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished <NS type="M"><c>them for</c></NS> their bad <NS type="FN"><i>behaviours</i><c>behaviour</c></NS>.</p>
<p>When I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>become</i><c>became</c></NS></i><c>received</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>your's</i><c>your</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> concerning the show "Over the Rainbow" I thought that <NS type="TV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'd</c></NS> have a great evening, but <NS type="DY"><i>unfortunatelly</i><c>unfortunately</c></NS> it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>will start</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was <NS type="S"><i>abbsend</i><c>absent</c></NS>. The show had a <NS type="DJ"><i>45 minutes</i><c>45-minute</c></NS> delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>whot</i><c>what</c></NS> kind of discounts? I <NS type="TV"><i>haven't seen</i><c>didn't see</c></NS> any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to <NS type="FV"><i>paid</i><c>pay</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>a <NS type="SX"><i>full-prize</i><c>full-price</c></NS> for</i><c>for a full-price</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>his</i></NS> ticket. <NS type="S"><i>Becouse</i><c>Because</c></NS> the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course <NS type="DD"><i>your's</i><c>your</c></NS> theatre <NS type="AGN"><i>restaurants</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> was closed because of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> holiday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The <NS type="RN"><i>stay</i><c>story</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>has <NS type="IV"><i>begaun</i><c>begun</c></NS></i><c>began</c></NS> last year, when I <NS type="RV">stated</NS> my summer holiday. I had not any money for travelling <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> my parents were <NS type="R"><i>able</i><c>going</c></NS> to give me <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>if I only</i><c>only if I</c></NS> had <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>concret</i><c>concrete</c></NS> plans. I started <NS type="RV"><i>talking with</i><c>telling</c></NS> my parents that I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be travelling with my friends through <NS type="UP"><i>West-Europe</i><c>West Europe</c></NS> for one month. I had <NS type="W"><i>really a</i><c>a really</c></NS> good plan but <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>no</c></NS> good friends. I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>become</i><c>became</c></NS></i><c>received</c></NS> quite a lot of money and I left home. <NS type="RT"><i>During</i><c>For</c></NS> one week I <NS type="W"><i>was really</i><c>really was</c></NS> travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>railway-stations</i><c>railway stations</c></NS> or under <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> bridges. After one <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>home back</i><c>back home</c></NS> and <NS type="RV"><i>explained</i><c>told</c></NS> my parents <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> a lot of fun <NS type="W"><i>had I</i><c>I had</c></NS> with my friends - I don't know why I was such a <NS type="RN"><i>lair</i><c>liar</c></NS>. My parents <NS type="S"><i>belived</i><c>believed</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="UP"><i>word's</i><c>words</c></NS></i><c>story</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> my younger brother Pat told them the <NS type="DN"><i>true</i><c>truth</c></NS>. Now my <NS type="UP"><i>parents'</i><c>parents</c></NS> don't <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>words</i><c>story</c></NS>. But I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> this was a good lesson for me and I <NS type="M"><c>don't</c></NS> <NS type="DV"><i><NS type="RN"><i>lair</i><c>liar</c></NS></i><c>lie</c></NS> any more.</p>
<p>Really, what a mess <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you <NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS> in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be <NS type="RV"><i>reached</i><c>given</c></NS> either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful <NS type="RN"><i>client</i><c>customer</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The first <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> I think of is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>many</i><c>lots of</c></NS> libraries as I used to do. It also <NS type="RV"><i>makes</i><c>allows</c></NS> me <NS type="FV"><i>write</i><c>to write</c></NS> to my friends by e-mail. I did not <NS type="FV"><i>to write</i><c>write</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>at all to people</i><c>to people at all</c></NS> until I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> got <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>With</c></NS> this procedure, you only type and send, no need to <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> to the <NS type="UP"><i>post-office</i><c>post office</c></NS>!</p>
<p>Really, <NS type="R">this prize is wonderful to have a healthy life</NS>. I want to do two activities<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>:</c></NS> painting and tennis.

<p>My first job was <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Hillsborough's</i><c>Hillsborough</c></NS> concert ( I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> you heard about it). I was running <NS type="ID"><i>all the show</i><c>the whole show</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>responsability</i><c>responsibility</c></NS> was to <NS type="UV"><i>get</i></NS> dress her. I wasn't alone<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I worked with a staff of ten people. We had to take <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> some clothes <NS type="MY"><c>off</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>her</c></NS> and then to put on <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>ones <NS type="DY"><i>completly</i><c>completely</c></NS> different</i><c>completely different ones</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> in just <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few minutes (similar to Formula One).</p>
<p>From my point of view I can complain only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> small concert hall and <NS type="M"><c>the fact</c></NS> there were <NS type="AGN"><i>artist</i><c>artists</c></NS> from only six countries.

<p>One day Ivan caught a fish. It wasn't <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>usual</i><c>normal</c></NS> fish<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>.

<p>Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I <NS type="TV"><i>am working</i><c>work</c></NS> as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I <NS type="TV"><i>had spent</i><c>spent</c></NS> the <NS type="SX"><i>hole</i><c>whole</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show "Over The Rainbow" <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>would be</c></NS> (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> our stay in your city. But from the beginning we <NS type="RV"><i>found</i><c>had</c></NS> a lot of problems. Despite <NS type="UA"><i>we</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>are</i><c>being</c></NS> actors we had to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a <NS type="RJ"><i>full</i><c>full-price</c></NS> ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the <NS type="FN"><i>tickets</i><c>ticket</c></NS> desk was very <NS type="DJ"><i>unpolite</i><c>impolite</c></NS>. However, we decided to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our <NS type="RN"><i>purpose</i><c>intention</c></NS> was to give him a surprise. You can imagine <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>were our faces like</i><c>our faces were like</c></NS> when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay <NS type="UY"><i>there</i></NS> till the end of the show and to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>have</c></NS> dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its <NS type="DN"><i>closing-hour</i><c>closing time</c></NS> but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. <NS type="ID"><i>As you can read</i><c>As you can see</c></NS> it was not our "perfect evening out" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> hard work but I have to ask you <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the money <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement, before the <NS type="RN"><i>starting time</i><c>start</c></NS> of the show. I am waiting <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> your answer,</p>
<p>Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>large</c></NS> amount of information in the minimum space.</p>
<p>I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to <NS type="RV"><i>learn</i><c>express</c></NS> their opinions about shopping they <NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>might</c></NS> tell you they don't like shopping but I <NS type="X"><i>suppose it is not true</i><c>don't suppose it is true</c></NS>. For example <NS type="UA"><i>me</i></NS>, when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I <NS type="TV"><i>hadn't liked</i><c>didn't like</c></NS> it. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "<NS type="RP"><i>yes</i><c>Yes</c></NS>, I like it". When people hear this word shopping they only think about <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> some stores and <NS type="FV"><i>try</i><c>trying</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>on</c></NS> new clothes or shoes and <NS type="FV"><i>search</i><c>searching</c></NS> for their size and so on. They don't think about other <NS type="FN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of shopping which are <NS type="R">liked by themselves</NS>. Maybe they like shopping on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> or window shopping<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping <NS type="AGN"><i>style</i><c>styles</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the world<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I am sure everybody <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>prefer</i><c>prefers</c></NS></i><c>likes</c></NS> one of them.</p>
<p>My girlfriend and I read an advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the show "Over the Rainbow"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for <NS type="IJ"><i>discounts</i><c>discount</c></NS> tickets, we were <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>told</c></NS> there never were discount offers and that we had to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="RJ"><i>highest</i><c>most expensive</c></NS> tickets - £20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid <NS type="RY"><i>off</i><c>up</c></NS>. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait <NS type="MY"><c>until</c></NS> 8.15 pm before it started<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.</p>
<p>I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> jeans. <NS type="S"><i>Syntethic</i><c>Synthetic</c></NS> materials have <NS type="RV"><i>grown up</i><c>developed</c></NS> and become very popular so <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> would keep going <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS>. But maybe the shape of the clothes will <NS type="TV"><i>changed</i><c>change</c></NS>: large <NS type="W"><i>pants <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> "baggy"</i><c>"baggy" pants</c></NS>, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for <NS type="UP"><i>men's</i><c>men</c></NS>. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of <NS type="R"><i>clothes</i><c>dressing</c></NS>. I guess they will wear a sort of <NS type="S"><i>tunique</i><c>tunic</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>upon</i><c>over</c></NS> a shirt and a skirt, or more <NS type="RJ"><i>male</i><c>masculine</c></NS> clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>Among</c></NS> the staff you can also find young people and <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>getting</i><c>having</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> fun with them during <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> work.</p>
<p>I was pleased to hear from you last week. Now I am writing to you because a story <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. Its title is "Accident"</p>
<p>Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it <NS type="IV"><i>catchs</i><c>catches</c></NS> your <NS type="RN"><i>attention</i><c>interest</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> the first moment.</p>
<p><NS type="TV"><i>I've recently visited</i><c>I recently visited</c></NS> London <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I am really sorry to say that I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>was</c></NS> very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the whole organisation of the musical, starting <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook<NS type="RP"><i>. An</i><c>, an</c></NS> actor that I admire and I wanted to see <NS type="UA"><i>him</i></NS> performing. Unfortunately<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally <NS type="R"><i>stranger</i><c>unknown</c></NS> to me. Secondly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the advertisement<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the starting time of the musical was said to be <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> 19:30, but the <NS type="RN"><i>theatre</i><c>show</c></NS> started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not <NS type="S"><i>proffessional</i><c>professional</c></NS> at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.</p>
<p>There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at <NS type="S"><i>yor</i><c>your</c></NS> restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> and the musical finished at 11:30. <NS type="RC"><i>And</i><c>So</c></NS> I am asking you: <NS type="RP"><i>Why</i><c>why</c></NS> do you <NS type="S"><i>adverstise</i><c>advertise</c></NS> it if is not going to be available <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the audience?</p>
<p>In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology <NS type="TV"><i>is offering</i><c>offers</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> humanity <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really <NS type="RV">support</NS> is that if you know how to use technology<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is a benefit <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> you. If you don't<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is going to destroy you.</p>
<p>The trip that you <NS type="TV"><i>planned</i><c>have planned</c></NS> for us<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> students<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city <NS type="U"><i>like London</i></NS>. Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the students the best way to spend <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>their</c></NS> time without wasting time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> silly places or events. We'd like to thank you because <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> kind of <NS type="RN"><i>happening</i><c>event</c></NS> shows how <NS type="W"><i>you are dedicated</i><c>dedicated you are</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> our school and the students that study there. It's <NS type="W"><i>great to visit especially</i><c>especially great to visit</c></NS> the Science Museum<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because of its <NS type="RN"><i>expositions</i><c>exhibitions</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Our suggestion is that you could change <NS type="R">the day of the leisure time to the shopping in the afternoon</NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>In</c></NS> this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion <NS type="MN"><c>Show</c></NS>. Thanks for <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> attention and we're waiting for your answer.</p>
<p>It's important to respect other <NS type="MP"><i>people</i><c>people's</c></NS> lives because <NS type="R">it</NS> can cause serious problems <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for <NS type="DN"><i>privacity</i><c>privacy</c></NS> the media has to respect <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>. Everybody likes to be with <NS type="RD"><i>your</i><c>their</c></NS> family without any reporter or photographer <NS type="MV"><c>hanging around</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you to <NS type="RV"><i>show</i><c>express</c></NS> my <NS type="R"><i>disagree</i><c>disappointment</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the musical show 'Over the rainbow.</p>
<p>First, I am very <NS type="S"><i>dissapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS>. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike.</p>
<p>Another thing is that there were not any discounts <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the entrance fee.</p>
<p>But, <NS type="R"><i>when</i><c>then</c></NS> my mother <NS type="TV"><i>was talking</i><c>talked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> Pat's mother and she mentioned it, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> my mother cancelled the trip to Africa.</p>
<p>I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were <NS type="UP"><i>reasonably-priced</i><c>reasonably priced</c></NS> for all events.  I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Arts Festival <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the end.</p>
<p>On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.  The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.  They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.  He came and said to the widower that he was to <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> him on his back.  The widow<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who was afaid<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> told the man <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> the gold.</p>
<p>When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.  He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle.</p>
<p>I'M WRITING TO YOU TO <NS type="RV"><i>EXPLAIN</i><c>DESCRIBE</c></NS> MY <NS type="S"><i>DESAGREABLE</i><c>DISAGREEABLE</c></NS> EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> LAST SATURDAY, <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> YOUR SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW".</p>
<p>FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU <NS type="FV"><i>KNOW</i><c>TO KNOW</c></NS> THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY <NS type="RT"><i>DURING</i><c>FOR</c></NS> ONE MONTH. MY INTENTION WAS TO <NS type="RV"><i>SPEND</i><c>HAVE</c></NS> <NS type="FD"><i>AN</i><c>A</c></NS> SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL!!!</p>
<p>YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR <NS type="FY"><i>LATER</i><c>LATE</c></NS> AND <NS type="RT"><i>WITH</i><c>WITHOUT</c></NS> ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE <NS type="RN"><i>ENTRY</i><c>PRICE OF THE TICKETS</c></NS>. BUT <NS type="RA"><i>IT</i><c>THAT</c></NS> WASN'T THE <NS type="FJ"><i>WORSE</i><c>WORST</c></NS>, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES <NS type="MT"><c>OF</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>TO PLAY</i><c>PUTTING ON A PLAY</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE THEATRE. BUT WHAT <NS type="W"><i>CANNOT I</i><c>I CANNOT</c></NS> FORGIVE <NS type="UT"><i>TO</i></NS> YOUR COMPANY IS <NS type="FV"><i>TO CHANGE</i><c>CHANGING</c></NS> THE <NS type="RN"><i>START</i><c>TIME IT STARTS</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>AT THE LAST MOMENT</i><c>AT THE LAST MINUTE</c></NS>, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY <NS type="S"><i>DISSAPOINTED</i><c>DISAPPOINTED</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>IT</i><c>THAT</c></NS> ISN'T ALL. WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER, AS YOU <NS type="RV"><i>PUBLISHED</i><c>SUGGESTED</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE <NS type="S"><i>PROGRAMM</i><c>PROGRAMME</c></NS>, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS <NS type="R">ON PUBLIC WORKS</NS>!!!</p>
<p>Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully.</p>
<p>So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> really important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> our <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> things</i><c>things that are really important in our lives</c></NS>.</p>
<p>That <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> all I would like to recommend you <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>I</c></NS> would be <NS type="S"><i>greatful</i><c>grateful</c></NS> if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> your decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I agree that <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> famous <NS type="MP"><i>people</i><c>people's</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> should be <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> private. It is <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>of</c></NS> benefit <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> themselves and the public.</p>
<p>And I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I've had unpleasant <NS type="FN"><i>experience</i><c>experiences</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent. In addition<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin.</p>
<p>I am writing, <NS type="ID"><i>on the name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>are giving</c></NS> us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the programme.</p>
<p>The programme you <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>of</c></NS> cultural visits and more relaxed activities.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly <NS type="W"><i>after the Science Museum to the show</i><c>to the show after the Science Museum</c></NS>. We all agree that we have enough time <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Wednesday for shopping.</p>
<p>I hope that you will agree <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer.</p>
<p><NS type="UT"><i>On your</i><c>Your</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is held once a year. This show <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> give us a lot of <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> about current activities, fashion and what is <NS type="FV"><i>happened</i><c>happening</c></NS> here in London <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>lastest</i><c>latest</c></NS> fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> hairstyles.</p>
<p><NS type="UP"><i>I'am</i><c>I am</c></NS> looking forward to hearing your opinion <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> my suggestion.</p>
<p>"Home" has so much meaning <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people. It doesn't <NS type="SX"><i>mater</i><c>matter</c></NS> who they are, where they <NS type="TV"><i>are coming</i><c>come</c></NS> from, <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>color</i><c>colour</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>of their</i></NS> skin they have.</p>

<p><NS type="AGD"><i>This</i><c>These</c></NS> 2 feelings <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the future.</p>
<p>I am writing to you <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>reply</i><c>answer</c></NS></i><c>to answer</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>answers</i><c>questions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>in</c></NS> your letter.</p>
<p>If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>home town</i><c>hometown</c></NS></i><c>town</c></NS> that is a seaside city<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>was starting</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>trainning</i><c>training</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>in</c></NS> 1996, and I have never <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>given</c></NS> it up. <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="S"><i>Esepically</i><c>Especially</c></NS></i><c>In particular</c></NS>, it <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> really good for my <NS type="DN"><i>healthy</i><c>health</c></NS> <NS type="R">during the growth period</NS>. Photography is my hobby <NS type="U"><i>that is taken in my spare time</i></NS>. I can remember that I used to take photographs <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> the exhibitions or during the holidays. It <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>will</c></NS> be nice <NS type="R">for my memories</NS> when I am older. In addition, it could <NS type="FV"><i>showed</i><c>show</c></NS> people how nice the places <NS type="M"><c>I have been</c></NS> are and the <NS type="R">views I have got</NS>. Therefore, I would like to do those two activities.</p>
<p>In my opinion, women <NS type="TV"><i>are really enjoying</i><c>really enjoy</c></NS> shopping. <NS type="R">It seems a human activity during their spare time</NS>. However, we are going to change <NS type="M"><c>from the</c></NS> traditional system to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> "e-shopping". It is new for customers<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS></i><c>. With</c></NS> technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it <NS type="R">looks like a service</NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> also boring for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> customer. I think most <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="L"><i>gentlemen</i><c>men</c></NS> dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>for</c></NS> women <NS type="FV"><i>finish</i><c>to finish</c></NS> their shopping.</p>
<p>I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - <NS type="RP"><i>over the rainbow</i><c>Over the Rainbow</c></NS>. I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> published <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the newspaper.</p>
<p><NS type="AS"><i>According to the advert, it says clearly</i><c>The advert clearly says</c></NS> that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I <NS type="R">did not have this offer</NS>. As a result, I had to pay the full price of £15. The second point is that the show <NS type="R">had a delay of</NS> about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> whom I <NS type="R">was coming</NS>. After the show we went to the <NS type="RP"><i>Theatre</i><c>theatre</c></NS> restaurant, but it was closed <NS type="RT"><i>due to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> refurbishment.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>was</c></NS> not really satisfied <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out. I therefore would like to have a <NS type="RN"><i>compensation</i><c>refund</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> £30 which I spent on the tickets.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it. I <NS type="X"><i>thought I was not</i><c>didn't think I was</c></NS> going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been <NS type="DJ"><i>untrustful</i><c>untrustworthy</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>but</i><c>But</c></NS> <NS type="R">this idea was soon be put off</NS> since I noticed <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="R">was really sure that I won</NS> a return ticket to the <NS type="S"><i>Meditarenian</i><c>Mediterranean</c></NS> Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. <NS type="MT"><i>The</i><c>For the</c></NS> last few days, we spent our time <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'.</p>
<p>Last week, I had a week's holiday in London, where I <NS type="TV"><i>haven't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> been for 2 years. I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, <NS type="R">the last day was the worst thing we have got</NS>, which was your musical show. At first, you said that<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if we <NS type="TV"><i>had bought</i><c>bought</c></NS> 5 tickets, we would <NS type="FV"><i>have had</i><c>have</c></NS> a discount, but we didn't <NS type="R">have anything</NS>. Secondly, we booked <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15<NS type="RP"><i>, what's</i><c>. What's</c></NS> wrong with your clock?<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> Thirdly, <NS type="R"><i>someone</i><c>the person</c></NS> on stage was very <NS type="S"><i>strenge</i><c>strange</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me, because I expected to see "Danny Brook", but I didn't. The last <NS type="R"><i>one</i><c>thing</c></NS><NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> is</c></NS> we wanted to have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> dinner in your restaurant after <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> terrible musical show, but we couldn't <NS type="U"><i>have it</i></NS>, because a waiter said your chef had gone home. I have no idea <NS type="R">what your business is</NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I have never seen <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> like this.</p>
<p>By the way, I want you to <NS type="RV"><i>pay</i><c>give</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> the <NS type="DJ"><i>waste</i><c>wasted</c></NS> time, and I think that you understand.</p>
<p>Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad. I would never <NS type="TV"><i>expected</i><c>have expected</c></NS> that I could be so <NS type="DJ"><i>decepted</i><c>deceived</c></NS>. This is not the <NS type="S"><i>firt</i><c>first</c></NS> time I have been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure "Over the rainbow" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have <NS type="S"><i>demostrated</i><c>demonstrated</c></NS> that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or <NS type="S"><i>shoudn't</i><c>shouldn't</c></NS> be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my <NS type="IJ"><i>favourites</i><c>favourite</c></NS> singers, whose career I have been following <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS>, and <NS type="MN"><c>Danny Brook</c></NS> never <NS type="AGV"><i>appear</i><c>appears</c></NS>, and nobody <NS type="AGV"><i>give</i><c>gives</c></NS> any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> do instead. Even <NS type="RV"><i>listening</i><c>playing</c></NS> some music to help us take it easy would <NS type="FV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> been better than nothing! <NS type="R"><i>None an</i><c>No</c></NS> announcement, <NS type="R"><i>not an</i><c>no</c></NS> <NS type="RN">invitation</NS>...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> that point. That terrible place <NS type="RY"><i>definitively</i><c>definitely</c></NS> needed <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>renewal</i><c>refurbishment</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Of course, you <NS type="S"><i>shoud</i><c>should</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>give</c></NS> a refund <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the money <NS type="MV"><c>spent</c></NS>, not only to me but to all the <NS type="RN"><i>public</i><c>audience</c></NS>. But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least <NS type="R"><i>till</i><c>not as long as</c></NS> you continue as its manager.</p>
<p>It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of <NS type="S"><i>accesories</i><c>accessories</c></NS> are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> always, just <NS type="RQ"><i>some</i><c>a few</c></NS> weeks. <NS type="RA"><i>All</i><c>Everything</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>that is</c></NS> in fashion <NS type="AGV"><i>pass</i><c>passes</c></NS> away in a couple of months and has to be created again.</p>
<p>How has modern <NS type="S"><i>techology</i><c>technology</c></NS> changed my daily life<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> Fifty years ago people <NS type="W"><i>even didn't</i><c>didn't even</c></NS> think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that <NS type="S"><i>centure</i><c>century</c></NS>. And nowadays modern technology can change all our <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS>. I mean, almost everyone <NS type="W"><i>has now</i><c>now has</c></NS> a car, a computer, a <NS type="S"><i>mobil</i><c>mobile</c></NS> phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. Second<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> modern technology helps me in the kitchen. <NS type="S"><i>Coocking</i><c>Cooking</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>became</i><c>has become</c></NS> faster with the help of the microwave. What is more<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Modern</i><c>modern</c></NS> technology prevents different illnesses. <NS type="RP"><i>Further more</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, yesterday <NS type="TV"><i>I've heard</i><c>I heard</c></NS> that every man could fly <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> in <NS type="W"><i>2050 <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> year</i><c>the year 2050</c></NS> everybody will fly <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> space.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p>- the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30. Please check your times because many people had to leave <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the middle of the show.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The modern</i><c>Modern</c></NS> technology has changed my life in many <NS type="S"><i>difents</i><c>different</c></NS> ways: But this "modern technology" has advantages and disadvantages. <NS type="ID"><i>In on hand</i><c>On the one hand</c></NS> we have the advantages<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> new technology <NS type="RV"><i>permits</i><c>allows</c></NS> you <NS type="MV"><c>to do</c></NS> many things like <NS type="FV"><i>fly</i><c>flying</c></NS>, <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> in the dark, or <NS type="M"><c>it can</c></NS> even save your life when you are almost dead. But <NS type="ID"><i>in the other hand</i><c>on the other hand</c></NS> we have the disadvantages. <NS type="UD"><i>The technology</i><c>Technology</c></NS> makes your life easier but<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>until when</i><c>for how long</c></NS>? For example, the car was developed <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>through</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> makes your life easier but also <NS type="MY"><c>more</c></NS> "dangerous". Why? Because too many cars <NS type="AGV"><i>mean</i><c>means</c></NS> too much CO2 in the air. And <NS type="R"><i>all people</i><c>everyone</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS> that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> and <NS type="RV"><i>permit</i><c>allow</c></NS> you <NS type="MV"><c>to do</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>may</i><c>many</c></NS> things <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> would be impossible in <NS type="R"><i>other times</i><c>the past</c></NS> but also <NS type="RV"><i>gives</i><c>creates</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> many problems.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>As for</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> "Over The Rainbow"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> presented <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems.</p>
<p>Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement for this musical show as "Danny Brook". As I was so looking <NS type="S"><i>foreward</i><c>forward</c></NS> to seeing Danny's <NS type="RN"><i>stage</i><c>performance</c></NS>, I was very disappointed. I think you should have informed us of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>changing</i><c>change</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> before starting <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> the show. In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was <NS type="RV"><i>changed</i><c>replaced</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> mentioned <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement.</p>
<p>But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a <NS type="UP"><i>birthday-party</i><c>birthday party</c></NS> for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been "surprising". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents <NS type="TV"><i>already died</i><c>had already died</c></NS> when she was in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>high-school</i><c>high school</c></NS>. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have <NS type="UD"><i>their</i></NS> children. In spite of such difficulties, she always <NS type="RV"><i>shows</i><c>has</c></NS> a pretty<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> charming smile <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> us.</p>
<p>When Sally came out <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>dyscotheque</i><c>discotheque</c></NS> I was very <NS type="RJ"><i>nervous</i><c>angry</c></NS> and I started to shout <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> her. She hit me and I decided <NS type="R"><i>in this moment</i><c>then</c></NS> that I <NS type="W"><i>never should</i><c>should never</c></NS> speak <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> her <NS type="MY"><c>again</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to <NS type="S"><i>attent</i><c>attend</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS>, and we are all <NS type="RJ"><i>fond</i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the latest fashion. We noticed that it is free for students<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so the price of the trip will not rise.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that almost everything in <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> future house will be automatic and will <NS type="RV"><i>obey</i><c>respond</c></NS> to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which will control <NS type="RP"><i>every thing</i><c>everything</c></NS>, every item of <NS type="S"><i>furiture</i><c>furniture</c></NS>, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to <NS type="S"><i>programm</i><c>programme</c></NS> them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they <NS type="W"><i>just will</i><c>will just</c></NS> stay in their rooms and study <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> computer, <NS type="MV"><c>gaining</c></NS> some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, <NS type="RN"><i>caps</i><c>cups</c></NS> will be <NS type="CL"><i>washed and cleaned</i><c>washed</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>automaticly</i><c>automatically</c></NS>. It is possible that only one computer will do <NS type="W"><i>this all</i><c>all this</c></NS> and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight..</p>
<p>I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>WITH</c></NS> THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>AT</c></NS> THIS THEATRE.</p>
<p>AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET.</p>
<p>ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>AT</c></NS> THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW.</p>
<p>FINALLY, WE <NS type="RV"><i>CAN</i><c>SHOULD</c></NS> CONSIDER, TOO, THAT <NS type="UD"><i>THE</i></NS> TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS <NS type="RT"><i>ABOUT</i><c>OF</c></NS> HEALTH, <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON.</p>
<p>Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is <NS type="RJ"><i>funnier</i><c>more fun</c></NS> than <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS>. <NS type="RY"><i>However</i><c>Also</c></NS>, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS></i><c>. For</c></NS> one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I and my friend used to win the first <NS type="RN">place</NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DJ">school-wide</NS> match when we <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> school. And <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; <NS type="RP"><i>Painting</i><c>painting</c></NS> is one of my hobbies and I've been <NS type="RV"><i>learning</i><c>studying</c></NS> it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it <NS type="R"><i>once</i><c>when</c></NS> I have <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> free time.</p>
<p>Above <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> all the information you asked <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>here</i><c>there</c></NS> are <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>something</i><c>some thing</c></NS></i><c>some things</c></NS> I'd like to know; <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> first is about the clothes<NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>. What</c></NS> kind of clothes <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> I need to take with <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS>? And another question is what <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> the prices of things like <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> there, <NS type="M"><c>which I want to know</c></NS> so that I can make a better <NS type="S"><i>buget</i><c>budget</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my trip.</p>
<p>Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> interested <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my experience of helping <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the pop concert <NS type="R">last time</NS><NS type="RP"><i>, now</i><c>. Now</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>tell</i><c>will tell</c></NS> you about it.</p>
<p>But <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>brakes</i><c>breaks</c></NS> and after work, I had a chance to talk with the <NS type="S"><i>engieners</i><c>engineers</c></NS>, and I <NS type="RV"><i>leant</i><c>learnt</c></NS> something about setting up the <NS type="S"><i>equitment</i><c>equipment</c></NS>.</p>
<p>When I saw the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show it was written that the show <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>started</i><c>start</c></NS> at a half past seven but <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> started at a quarter past eight.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for <NS type="UJ"><i>other</i></NS> exams or I will be <NS type="RY"><i>out</i><c>away</c></NS> travelling somewhere else with my relatives.</p>
<p>I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> that I have never done before, which is Sailing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>so</i></NS> I am a <NS type="DJ"><i>totally</i><c>total</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>begginer</i><c>beginner</c></NS> at this. The other <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> is Photography<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera<NS type="RP"><i>, all</i><c>.  All</c></NS> I want is to improve my knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many <NS type="MN"><c>clothes</c></NS> I should pack. Is there any place <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>where</c></NS> I can wash my clothes? I also <NS type="TV"><i>needed</i><c>need</c></NS> some information <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> the money I <NS type="RV"><i>will</i><c>should</c></NS> take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all?</p>
<p>When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> me that it seemed we had known each <NS type="RA"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> ages! They weren't <NS type="R"><i>those</i><c>the</c></NS> kind of people that think they're gods.</p>
<p>My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> the shows at your theatre.</p>
<p>Last May, I had a <NS type="MP"><i>week</i><c>week's</c></NS> holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL <NS type="UN"><i>SHOW</i></NS>. I was really excited <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the idea of seeing that show.</p>
<p>First of all, when I arrived, I <NS type="RV"><i>met</i><c>found</c></NS> a note stuck on the front door that informed <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> about changes <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>actor's staff</i><c>list of performers</c></NS>. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were <NS type="RJ"><i>bad</i><c>poor</c></NS>.</p>
<p>When she finished <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school, she went to study <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the Agent <NS type="DN"><i>Trainning</i><c>Training</c></NS> Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc. She was the best student they <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> ever had.</p>
<p>At first she walked around the <NS type="MP"><i>bayside</i><c>bay-side</c></NS> market<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> looking <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>at</c></NS> all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> the rest, talking with one of the <NS type="RN"><i>sellers</i><c>salesmen</c></NS><NS type="W"><i><NS type="RP"><i>. Immediately</i><c>, immediately</c></NS> she interrupted</i><c>, she interrupted immediately</c></NS> and told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the man that she was a secret agent. Obviously the man realised that she was looking for him and said that she was really crazy!</p>
<p>You can imagine what <NS type="TV"><i>had happened</i><c>happened</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> her cover <NS type="U"><i>as a spy</i></NS>.</p>
<p>I really wish you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>had been</c></NS> there with me <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>that</i></NS> one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready?</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>That</i><c>It</c></NS> was a pop concert <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> Steps in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.</p>
<p>I'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW. <NS type="RT"><i>Regarding</i><c>According to</c></NS> your advertisement, it is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> LONDON'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW, but I was deeply disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>with</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>According to your advertisement, the <NS type="DN"><i>starrings</i><c>stars</c></NS> were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE. I decided to go to see this show because of its <NS type="DN"><i>starrings</i><c>stars</c></NS>, but <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the day I saw it, a different actor <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>performed</c></NS>. He was not DANNY BROOK.</p>
<p>Below are my suggestions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> what should be filmed.</p>
<p>I'm sorry <NS type="R"><i>of</i><c>to be</c></NS> writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you <NS type="RV"><i>announced</i><c>advertised</c></NS>: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the <NS type="RN"><i>scene</i><c>stage</c></NS>! By the way, what really upset me was the <NS type="W"><i>time of starting</i><c>starting time</c></NS>. According to your advertisement it <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>started</c></NS> at 19:30, and<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was from £10 to £20, but despite <NS type="ID"><i>my thoughts</i><c>what I thought</c></NS> I had to pay £20 without <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>chance</i><c>options</c></NS>. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself <NS type="FV"><i>visit</i><c>visiting</c></NS> the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>unpleased</i><c>unpleasant</c></NS> experience. It was <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>lunch time</i><c>lunchtime</c></NS>. Everybody <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS></i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>went</i><c>had gone</c></NS> to <NS type="SX"><i>by</i><c>buy</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>luch</i><c>lunch</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> supermarket<NS type="RP"><i>, in</i><c>. In</c></NS> fact, nobody <NS type="TV"><i>liked</i><c>likes</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>crowe</i><c>crowds</c></NS> and <NS type="S"><i>quare</i><c>queues</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>expecially</i><c>especially</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> in the <NS type="RP"><i>summer time</i><c>summertime</c></NS>. I was <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>quare</i><c>queue</c></NS></i><c>queuing</c></NS> <NS type="R">in the middle of row</NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>chose</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>row</i><c>aisle</c></NS> because I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> it was quicker than <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FA"><i>other</i><c>others</c></NS>. <NS type="CE">Although there were finished two people, next was me, something was happened</NS>. Suddenly the customer <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> the receipt was not <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>truth</i><c>true</c></NS></i><c>right</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, she</i><c>.

<p>In conclusion, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the lessons and also <NS type="R"><i>be successful at</i><c>pass</c></NS> the exam <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> June 2000. In our class, we don't have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> problem with students who dislike <NS type="FV"><i>to work</i><c>working</c></NS>, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>stay</c></NS> there <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.</p>
<p>In my <NS type="RJ">sweet</NS> home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are <NS type="RY"><i>in society</i><c>out</c></NS>, we have to be careful not to disturb the other <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS>. It is the same in our family<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> for</i><c>. For</c></NS> example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my parents dislike hearing music <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>throughout</c></NS> the whole house <NS type="CE">or that I let dust everywhere</NS>. When I go out, they don't give me <NS type="RN"><i>an hour</i><c>a time</c></NS> to be <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> home, because <NS type="R"><i>I don't <NS type="S"><i>exagerate</i><c>exaggerate</c></NS></i><c>I'm sensible</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>of</c></NS> my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for £20 to <NS type="UV"><i>pay</i></NS> the address above.</p>
<p>I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> mixture of styles from different times <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. <NS type="UD"><i>A new</i><c>New</c></NS> technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their <NS type="FN"><i>colour</i><c>colours</c></NS> during the day.</p>
<p>In the future people will be even more concerned <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>pollutions</i><c>pollution</c></NS> and harmful UV-rays. So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy.</p>
<p>Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the second week of July because I will be very busy <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> any other <NS type="RN"><i>date</i><c>time</c></NS> for <NS type="W"><i>reasons of work</i><c>work reasons</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly I would prefer sleeping in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> because I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>fell</i><c>feel</c></NS> much more comfortable. One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> my back.</p>
<p>It would be a great <NS type="S"><i>plessure</i><c>pleasure</c></NS> to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm. First of all, as a reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter, I'd like to say, that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full-time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time. In July I can make an exception. <NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>With regards</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> I would prefer log cabins, as they are more comfortable and I like convenience. As <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the list of activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I choose climbing and surfing. I like new challenges, even when I've never done them before, and I'm really looking forward to gaining this new kind of experience. If you don't mind I would like to ask you some vital questions. Do I have to take warm clothes? How much money would you recommend me to take?</p>
<p>I would appreciate <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if you <NS type="TV"><i>send</i><c>sent</c></NS> me a reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> my Questions as soon as possible</p>
<p>,,Shopping is not always enjoyable". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> smile on their faces<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to <NS type="S"><i>sacrifise</i><c>sacrifice</c></NS> all their savings to get something that will make their <NS type="SA"><i>neighbor</i><c>neighbour</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>jelous</i><c>jealous</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Here are the problems <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late.</p>
<p>The modern technology which changed my daily life most is <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course <NS type="FN"><i>works</i><c>work</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the computer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping <NS type="SX"><i>secretes</i><c>secrets</c></NS>. This was the only reason why <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> she had not <NS type="MV"><c>got</c></NS> a lot of friends. When Pat <NS type="MY"><c>first</c></NS> came <NS type="UJ"><i>new</i></NS> into a class or a <NS type="S"><i>groupe</i><c>group</c></NS> of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few <NS type="AGN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS> the others <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>seen</i><c>see</c></NS> that Pat <NS type="TV"><i>can't</i><c>couldn't</c></NS> keep secrets. So they stopped <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RY"><i>nearly</i><c>almost</c></NS> immediately <NS type="FV"><i>to tell</i><c>telling</c></NS> her <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> important</i><c>telling her anything important almost immediately</c></NS>. Sometimes it finished <NS type="R"><i>like this that</i><c>with</c></NS> the others only <NS type="FV"><i>said</i><c>saying</c></NS>: "Hello, how are you?" <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> then <NS type="FV"><i>went</i><c>going</c></NS> away without listening <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>so</c></NS> she <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>would</c></NS> not <NS type="FV"><i>to think</i><c>think</c></NS> too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>coming</i><c>come</c></NS>. She dreamed about good friends, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> time that <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>had</c></NS> long passed by and she dreamed <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> someone who she <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> tell her own secrets.</p>
<p>Then one day she met this person. It was Katha, a girl who had the same <NS type="FN"><i>problems</i><c>problem</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> Pat. So they <NS type="W"><i>found both</i><c>both found</c></NS> the person they dreamed <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite <NS type="RJ">deceiving</NS>. I am writing to you to <NS type="DV"><i>complaint</i><c>complain</c></NS> about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> picked up in the hall of the theatre, <NS type="W"><i>are there</i><c>there are</c></NS> about five points which were not <NS type="RJ"><i>respected</i><c>true</c></NS>. To begin with, as far as the <NS type="R"><i>starring</i><c>cast</c></NS> is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very <NS type="RJ"><i>deceived</i><c>disappointed</c></NS>, and this could be the understatement of the year, <NS type="UY"><i>inasmuch</i></NS> as he is my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor. Apart from <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS>, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me the reasons <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> such a huge <NS type="R"><i>late</i><c>delay</c></NS>? Thirdly, the ad <NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS> possible discounts. <NS type="DY"><i>Personnaly</i><c>Personally</c></NS> speaking, I didn't <NS type="FV"><i>saw</i><c>see</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> and <NS type="W"><i>even didn't</i><c>didn't even</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>heard</i><c>hear</c></NS> of <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>: I <NS type="TV"><i>have asked</i><c>asked</c></NS> about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for <NS type="FN"><i>renovations</i><c>renovation</c></NS>! How can you dare <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>putting</i><c>put</c></NS></i><c>publish</c></NS> an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> the fact that I did not <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> a "perfect evening out" at all, <NS type="MQ"><c>such</c></NS> as <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS></i><c>promised</c></NS> in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam, <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> me my money back. I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>hear</i><c>hearing</c></NS> from you. Yours faithfully,</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>Everything had begun</i><c>It all began</c></NS> when Paul went downstairs <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel <NS type="RT"><i>across</i><c>along</c></NS> the dark paths of his <NS type="S"><i>councience</i><c>conscience</c></NS>. He went through <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves</p>
<p>All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was <NS type="RV"><i>wandering</i><c>wondering</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wether</i><c>whether</c></NS> this beast could be <NS type="RJ"><i>offensive</i><c>aggressive</c></NS> when the creature said these words<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "I am glad to meet you, Paul." The boy could not <NS type="S"><i>beleive</i><c>believe</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> what he was hearing. How did the beast <NS type="FV"><i>knew</i><c>know</c></NS> his name? "You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>get</c></NS> out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> your reality!"</p>
<p>At these words, Paul <NS type="S"><i>suddently</i><c>suddenly</c></NS> awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately...one <NS type="SX"><i>our</i><c>hour</c></NS> after <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>, a local zoo <NS type="MN"><c>keeper</c></NS> arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="M"><c>she did</c></NS> not <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Faerian food necessary <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> her survival.</p>
<p>During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the "Circle Theatre". The show was called "Over the rainbow" and should be, <NS type="R"><i>in <NS type="DN"><i>refer</i><c>reference</c></NS> to</i><c>to quote</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>, London's newest and best musical show. But I was very disappointed. I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> someone else I was very disappointed.</p>
<p>Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> begun at 19:30 but it started <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>after</c></NS> a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> mentioned some discounts in your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have been</i><c>was</c></NS> attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>performed</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>effectly</i><c>effectively</c></NS> that evening. <NS type="AGD"><i>This</i><c>These</c></NS> actors appeared <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>fourty-five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i><NS type="IV"><i>refering</i><c>referring</c></NS></i><c>according to</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> is written <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement. This <NS type="DN"><i>late</i><c>lateness</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>forbid</i><c>prevented</c></NS> me <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>going</c></NS> to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing!</p>
<p>I think <NS type="AGA"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> are the reasons <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> his <NS type="RN"><i>will</i><c>willpower</c></NS>. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have <NS type="TV"><i>triumph</i><c>triumphed</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>othe</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> fish because of his knowledge of the sea but <NS type="M"><c>it is</c></NS> principally because he has <NS type="R">known research</NS> in the <NS type="DN"><i>deeper</i><c>depths</c></NS> of his mind.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to start with the time of the <NS type="RN"><i>travelling</i><c>trip</c></NS>. I would prefer to go to the Camp <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Next</i><c>The next</c></NS> things to be shot, <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>according to</c></NS> the majority of students<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>was said to be</i><c>should be</c></NS> the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the <NS type="RN"><i>decoration</i><c>decor</c></NS> of our classrooms and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>done</c></NS> during the last <NS type="MQ"><c>few</c></NS> years and all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> modern conveniences that were <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>installed</c></NS> for both students and teachers.</p>
<p>All <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>exhibiots</i><c>exhibits</c></NS> are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.</p>
<p> Almost everyone <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>relation</i><c>relate</c></NS></i><c>relates</c></NS> famous people with photographers, articles, money, fans<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> ... Normally, one <NS type="AGN"><i>people's</i><c>person's</c></NS> dream is to be <NS type="CL"><i>famous and rich</i><c>rich and famous</c></NS> but without that stuff <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> being without privacy</p>
<p>Nowadays, there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> a lot of people <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="DV"><i>life</i><c>live</c></NS> only <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the money they get <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>advertisments</i><c>advertisements</c></NS>, reports about their last romance<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> ... but not everyone does the same <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS>. On the one hand you find the ones that are <NS type="UP"><i>well-known</i><c>well known</c></NS> and never talk about their <NS type="RN"><i>privacy</i><c>private life</c></NS>. They use the publicity <NS type="DY"><i>exclusive</i><c>exclusively</c></NS> for their work.</p>
<p>Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> close <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.</p>
<p>Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have <NS type="RQ"><i>much</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.</p>
<p>The concert was held <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.</p>
<p>I also helped <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to <NS type="RV"><i>fix</i><c>install</c></NS> new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.</p>
<p>I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August. <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="MP"><i>I m</i><c>I'm</c></NS></i><c>I've</c></NS> always <NS type="RV"><i>been</i><c>stayed</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>intents</i><c>in tents</c></NS> when I <NS type="TV"><i>went</i><c>have been</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the university camps so I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>one</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Considering</c></NS> your activities at the Camp, I would choose singing and painting because I am <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity. Also painting is my hobby because I have always <NS type="TV"><i>been painting</i><c>painted</c></NS> when I have <NS type="CQ"><i>a</i><c>some</c></NS> spare time. I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and <NS type="RP"><i>How</i><c>how</c></NS> much money I should bring.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for giving me a good opportunity. I look forward to going <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> your camp in the near future.</p>
<p>Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> different reasons and <NS type="R">places</NS>.</p>
<p>We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay £20 <NS type="RD"><i>each</i><c>a</c></NS> seat.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter. I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the camp.</p>
<p>In the first part of this book it can be seen <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>towards</c></NS> them. In some ways, he did not agree with "Black Consciousness" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist<NS type="RP"><i>, in</i><c>.

<p>Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> in reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer <NS type="UN"><i>season</i></NS>, and <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer <NS type="U"><i>my <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS></i></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>stay</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>, because I am <NS type="S"><i>alergic</i><c>allergic</c></NS> to some insects that might <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>get</c></NS> in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent. <NS type="ID"><i>In regard to</i><c>As regards</c></NS> the activities, I would <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have <NS type="MV"><c>learnt</c></NS> some techniques<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I would like to <NS type="ID"><i>put on practise</i><c>put into practice</c></NS>. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where <NS type="W"><i>can I</i><c>I can</c></NS> change my money to American dollars <NS type="DY"><i>cheaper</i><c>cheaply</c></NS>. I would <NS type="MV"><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>ask</i><c>to ask</c></NS> for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell</p>
<p>What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> a big team, working together. That was what made it <NS type="RY"><i>mostly</i><c>really</c></NS> special. Try it, I recommend it.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you about an <NS type="DN">enjure</NS> that I had <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your last musical <NS type="M"><c>at the</c></NS> Circle Theatre. I went to see "Over the rainbow" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening.</p>
<p>I read <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> in Friday's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the <NS type="RN"><i>representation</i><c>performance</c></NS> started at 20.15. I was <NS type="IV"><i>waitting</i><c>waiting</c></NS> 45 minutes for <NS type="RA"><i>anything</i><c>nothing</c></NS>!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Like</i><c>As</c></NS> mentioned in the newspaper<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money.</p>
<p>My life <NS type="AGV"><i>change</i><c>changes</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>because of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> modern technology. For <NS type="S"><i>exemple</i><c>example</c></NS>, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I <NS type="TV"><i>am going</i><c>go</c></NS> on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet and ask for what I need. The day after I get everything at home by post.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At last</i><c>Finally</c></NS>, after all these <NS type="RN"><i>disadvantages</i><c>disappointments</c></NS>, I was not able to have <NS type="RN"><i>diner</i><c>dinner</c></NS> in your theatre restaurant. It was closed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> some reason I still don't know.</p>
<p>Pat was a teacher <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>english</i><c>English</c></NS> as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have <NS type="RV"><i>learned</i><c>revised</c></NS> for it in advance. And always, <NS type="RP"><i>every body</i><c>everybody</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>did</c></NS> it surprisingly well.</p>
<p>I am waiting <NS type="FV"><i>hearing</i><c>to hear</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> you.</p>
<p>I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> by <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> professional coaches. <NS type="UV"><i>I'm</i><c>I</c></NS> enjoy playing both of them regularly.</p>
<p><NS type="RV"><i>I'm</i><c>I would</c></NS> not dare to <NS type="S"><i>culculate</i><c>calculate</c></NS> how much I have spent <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> those things without thinking. However, it was not bad<NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>mom</i><c>mum</c></NS> always told me that I hadn't <NS type="UV"><i>have</i></NS> earned enough money so <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>A</i><c>I</c></NS> came to <NS type="RV"><i>look at</i><c>see</c></NS> my <NS type="S"><i>favorit</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but <NS type="M"><c>the actors</c></NS> whom I saw were <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> people. Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> tickets and when I <NS type="S"><i>apeared</i><c>appeared</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>infrant</i><c>in front</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>casses</i><c>ticket desk</c></NS> I found out that the cost of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> tickets <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> real price <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> the same, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> real price was much higher. Also <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> show started very late <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="SX"><i>compere</i><c>compare</c></NS></i><c>compared</c></NS> to what was <NS type="IV"><i>writen</i><c>written</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement. And I think you know how it is just <NS type="FV"><i>sit</i><c>sitting</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i>wait</i><c>waiting</c></NS> for <NS type="L"><i>45min.</i><c>45 minutes</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>befor</i><c>before</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>beggining</i><c>beginning</c></NS>?</p>
<p>Begin at the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS>. Look at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>historical</i><c>history</c></NS> books <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> 400-600 years ago, or even <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> time of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> First and Second World <NS type="AGN"><i>War</i><c>Wars</c></NS>, <NS type="MV"><c>to see</c></NS> how <NS type="UV"><i>are</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>sociaty</i><c>society</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>changed</i><c>has changed</c></NS>, just because we <NS type="UV"><i>did</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>step</i><c>stepped</c></NS> up <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the <NS type="M"><c>advance of</c></NS> science and technology.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In one hand</i><c>On the one hand</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>scientist</i><c>scientists</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>discovered</i><c>have discovered</c></NS> a lot of <NS type="S"><i>medisent</i><c>medicines</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> different <NS type="IN"><i>illneses</i><c>illnesses</c></NS>, but <NS type="ID"><i>in an <NS type="S"><i>enother</i><c>another</c></NS> hand</i><c>on the other hand</c></NS> they discovered many <NS type="IN"><i>illneses</i><c>illnesses</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>about which we <NS type="TV"><i>haven't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>herd</i><c>heard</c></NS></i><c>which we hadn't heard about</c></NS> before. I think this <NS type="R">side of the question is balanced</NS> because before <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> effect on our health was less than it is now. More and more people <NS type="TV"><i>died</i><c>die</c></NS> from some <NS type="AGN"><i>illness</i><c>illnesses</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wheres</i><c>whereas</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time ago <NS type="CQ"><i>less</i><c>fewer</c></NS> people died from <NS type="M"><c>the same</c></NS> <NS type="IN"><i>illneses</i><c>illnesses</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>dispite</i><c>despite</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>the</c></NS> fact that they had <NS type="CQ"><i>less</i><c>fewer</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>medisent</i><c>medicines</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Society has to go <NS type="S"><i>forword</i><c>forward</c></NS> not to stop <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> one place.</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I want to <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>thank</c></NS> you <NS type="U"><i>the thanks</i></NS> for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the USA, so I think that this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS> will be an <NS type="DJ"><i>unforgetable</i><c>unforgettable</c></NS> experience.</p>
<p>Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and <NS type="RQ"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know <NS type="R">the money</NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> I have to take and <NS type="RQ"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look <NS type="S"><i>foward</i><c>forward</c></NS> to receiving your reply.</p>
<p>In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> some clothes <NS type="SX"><i>that</i><c>than</c></NS> you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping <NS type="FV"><i>is</i><c>being</c></NS> boring<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several <NS type="R"><i>clothes</i><c>items of clothing</c></NS> and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.</p>
<p>I hope you won't be too angry <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> this <NS type="DN"><i>changing</i><c>change</c></NS> but we would all like to go to the show.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>On behalf of</c></NS> the class</p>
<p>The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing <NS type="UN"><i>School</i></NS> homework and <NS type="M"><c>in the</c></NS> evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> them, I kept on<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>stucked</i><c>stuck</c></NS> in front of the screen.</p>
<p>First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>After reading the <NS type="SX"><i>hole</i><c>whole</c></NS> <NS type="RJ">organized</NS> programme, we all agreed about the sightseeing <NS type="MN"><c>tour</c></NS> by bus around London<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> will give us the knowledge <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> this fantastic city we <NS type="TV"><i>all want</i><c>have all wanted</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>meet</i><c>have</c></NS> since <NS type="M"><c>a long</c></NS> time ago.</p>
<p>The main purpose of our letter <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. We found the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> in a local newspaper <NS type="UN"><i>article</i></NS> and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> these topics:</p>
<p>I'm terribly sorry but I <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>notice</i><c>inform</c></NS></i><c>to inform</c></NS> you about a very disappointing evening. I'm sure you'll read this letter<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> with the intention of explaining the problems <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> had during the musical show <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>his</i><c>your</c></NS> theatre. One of the causes of my <NS type="DN"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointment</c></NS> was the <NS type="R"><i>different</i><c>substitute</c></NS> actor that played <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the show.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO <NS type="DV"><i>EXPRIME</i><c>EXPRESS</c></NS> MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> DIFFERENT <NS type="MA"><c>ONE</c></NS> , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15!</p>
<p>AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE <NS type="RJ"><i>WHOLE</i><c>FULL</c></NS> PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I <NS type="RV"><i>HAD INTENTION</i><c>INTENDED</c></NS> TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. <NS type="RY"><i>EVENTUALLY</i><c>FINALLY</c></NS>, YOU PROMISED <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT <NS type="RV"><i>HAD NOT BEEN</i><c>WAS NOT</c></NS> SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.</p>
<p>FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS. BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPES</i><c>DEVELOPS</c></NS>; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) <NS type="RN"><i>STYLISTS</i><c>DESIGNERS</c></NS> FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> OPPOSITE <NS type="RT"><i>FROM</i><c>OF</c></NS> ANOTHER. I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPE</i><c>DEVELOP</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>ACCORDING TO</i><c>ALONG</c></NS> VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE <NS type="UY"><i>YET</i></NS> NOW, OR A MORE <NS type="DJ"><i>FANTASCIENTIFIC</i><c>FANTASTIC</c></NS> AND TECHNOLOGICAL <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPEMENT</i><c>DEVELOPMENT</c></NS>. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE <NS type="IV"><i>FOCALIZED</i><c>FOCUSED</c></NS> ON <NS type="DN"><i>COMFORTABILITY</i><c>COMFORT</c></NS> MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE <NS type="S"><i>DEVELOPEMENTS</i><c>DEVELOPMENTS</c></NS> OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO <NS type="RJ"><i>VARIOUS</i><c>VARIED</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>CATHEGORY</i><c>CATEGORY</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am only available in July because I am studying <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July!</p>
<p>You asked me which <NS type="M"><c>type of</c></NS> accommodation I would prefer between <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log cabin. I am used to <NS type="FV"><i>spend</i><c>spending</c></NS> summer <NS type="FN"><i>holiday</i><c>holidays</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent and I like it, but why not try <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> tennis and surfing. In fact, I <NS type="RY">soon</NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>play</c></NS> tennis and I am <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> good at <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>, and it will <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to train <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i> surfing</i><c>.  Surfing</c></NS> is completely <NS type="RJ"><i>unknown</i><c>new</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the information you <NS type="TV"><i>needed</i><c>need</c></NS>, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a <NS type="RP"><i>boyscout</i><c>Boy Scout</c></NS> and <NS type="R"><i>go against</i><c>get a break from</c></NS> the routine.</p>
<p>The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the <NS type="RN"><i>spectacle</i><c>show</c></NS>. And I didn't even <NS type="FV"><i>got</i><c>get</c></NS> paid. But it was <NS type="RJ"><i>worthy</i><c>worth it</c></NS>. I <NS type="RV"><i>found</i><c>got</c></NS> my reward when the concert finished. After <NS type="UV"><i>been</i></NS> carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was <NS type="S"><i>eshausted</i><c>exhausted</c></NS>. But when Britney came <NS type="RY"><i>out of</i><c>off</c></NS> the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> her personal <NS type="RN"><i>changing room</i><c>dressing room</c></NS>. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me soon to tell me your <NS type="RN"><i>impression</i><c>thoughts</c></NS> about what happened to me. Bye.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>have received</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter this morning and I'm very happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>this</i><c>winning</c></NS> first prize.</p>
<p>It's a great opportunity for me <NS type="FV"><i>participate</i><c>to participate</c></NS> in your Camp California because <NS type="DY"><i>normaly</i><c>normally</c></NS> I work a lot and I can't spend money <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> travel<NS type="RP"><i>, moreover</i><c>. Moreover</c></NS>, I have to <NS type="RV"><i>maintain</i><c>support</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>a</c></NS> big family because I'm married and I have three children.</p>
<p>For <NS type="S"><i>de</i><c>the</c></NS> accommodation I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer a <NS type="SX"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabin because <NS type="TV"><i>it's</i><c>it'll be</c></NS> more comfortable. I <NS type="RV"><i>recognise</i><c>know</c></NS> that I would like to sleep in a tent but <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed.</p>
<p>I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this <NS type="RN">time</NS>. I have to choose painting and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> photography therefore. I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my <NS type="S"><i>helth</i><c>health</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In your letter you explain <NS type="UA"><i>me</i></NS> that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money. <NS type="W"><i>The weather I hope</i><c>I hope the weather</c></NS> will be good so I suppose I have to bring <NS type="RJ">short</NS> clothes.</p>
<p>UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS....AND WHEN SHE <NS type="RV"><i>KNEW</i><c>FOUND OUT</c></NS> THAT MARIA WAS GOING OUT WITH TIM (A CLASSMATE), SHE TOLD <NS type="U"><i>IT TO</i></NS> EVERYONE SHE MET. <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>WITHIN</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>A</c></NS> FEW DAYS MARIA'S FATHER (WHO IS VERY JEALOUS) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR. HE ASKED MARIA IF IT WAS TRUE AND SHE COULDN'T LIE. HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA <NS type="FV"><i>GOING</i><c>TO GO</c></NS> OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS. MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN <NS type="MT"><c>TO</c></NS> HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.</p>
<p>I am looking forward <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>holy day</i><c>holiday</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> begins on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> first of <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>lasting</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>until</c></NS> twenty-first <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so it is possible <NS type="U"><i>to take the</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>travell</i><c>travel</c></NS></i><c>to travel</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this time.

<p>It is not enjoyable to see that the <NS type="RN"><i>prize</i><c>price</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> food <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> going <NS type="ID"><i>more and more higher</i><c>higher and higher</c></NS>. My salary <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>going</i><c>getting</c></NS> lower <NS type="R"><i>than</i><c>and</c></NS> lower. When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of <NS type="RN"><i>goods</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>whitout</i><c>without</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>take care on</i><c>considering</c></NS> my money. Despite <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>have</i><c>having</c></NS> enough money<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> shopping is not always enjoyable <NS type="UT"><i>too</i></NS>, because I don't know which <NS type="RN"><i>goods</i><c>things</c></NS> I <NS type="R">will buy in the future</NS>. Also I will buy <NS type="RN"><i>goods</i><c>things</c></NS> which I don't need.</p>
<p>It <NS type="TV"><i>is said</i><c>said</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in the advertisement</i><c>in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove</c></NS>. However, there was a different<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> unknown actor in that. The show started <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> at 20:15<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was very different <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> '19.30' <NS type="R">as shown</NS>. There was no discount at all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> in contrast with 'Discounts <NS type="S"><i>Availabe</i><c>Available</c></NS>'. After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> no reason.</p>
<p>The fashion <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="DJ">nowaday</NS> <NS type="CN"><i>clothings</i><c>clothing</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> just <NS type="AGV"><i>keep</i><c>keeps</c></NS> on changing.

<p><NS type="RY">So</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and even <NS type="RP"><i>hair styles</i><c>hairstyles</c></NS>.

<p>As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having <NS type="CQ"><i>a</i><c>some</c></NS> free time. I'm looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>recieving</i><c>receiving</c></NS> a letter from you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Of course there will be differences between <NS type="MP"><i>todays</i><c>today's</c></NS> homes and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> future ones.

<p>Last week, I went to London<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your theatre to see "Over the rainbow" and I had a disappointing evening.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>There</i><c>The</c></NS> problems were<NS type="RP"><i>; Firstly</i><c>: firstly</c></NS>, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> your <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show, I was unhappy to <NS type="DV">constat</NS> that <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> different actors <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> evening. Secondly, the <NS type="W"><i>show of 19:30</i><c>19:30 show</c></NS> only started at 20:15; <NS type="RP"><i>Thirdly</i><c>thirdly</c></NS>, your advertisement said: "Discounts available"; but it wasn't the case. <NS type="DJ"><i>Fourthly</i><c>Fourth</c></NS>, the restaurant was closed for <NS type="CN"><i>renovations</i><c>renovation</c></NS> and you <NS type="RV"><i>don't</i><c>shouldn't</c></NS> have <NS type="TV"><i>to propose</i><c>proposed</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>us</i><c>we</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>go</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Like</i><c>As</c></NS> you can see, I'm very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money. That's why I ask you to give <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back. I ask you <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> me £20, back by <NS type="SA"><i>check</i><c>cheque</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The technology</i><c>Technology</c></NS> is the future, and the present. For instance, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RJ"><i>All</i><c>Whole</c></NS> the</i><c>The whole</c></NS> world is now connected <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> it. <NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Internet is the "new" revolution of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>communication</i><c>communications</c></NS> and knowledge. <NS type="AS"><i>It is now ten years that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet exists</i><c>The Internet has existed for ten years now</c></NS>, but we only <NS type="MV"><c>used to</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>used</i><c>use</c></NS> it for army and government <NS type="MN"><c>purposes</c></NS>.

<p>I write you this letter because I want to tell you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> my experiences <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival. I <NS type="TV"><i>have spent</i><c>spent</c></NS> two days at the "International Arts Festival" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some <NS type="RN">details</NS> could be better the next time. For example, on the leaflet it was written that there <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries. That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was <NS type="R">bad air</NS> and not enough <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>room</c></NS> for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small <NS type="RN">offer</NS>; I hope it will be larger the next time.</p>
<p>Dear Helen Ryan: Thank you for letting me know about my prize <NS type="MN"><c>trip</c></NS> to Camp California in the USA. Here I will <NS type="S"><i>answear</i><c>answer</c></NS> all the questions that you <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> me, and I will ask you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> other things that you <NS type="S"><i>dind't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> mention. <NS type="TV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'd</c></NS> like to organize my trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> July because <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> is when I have vacations, also because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is <NS type="RP"><i>summer time</i><c>summertime</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> U.S.A<NS type="RP"><i>, about</i><c>.

Helen<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> like to ask you how <NS type="CQ"><i>many</i><c>much</c></NS> money we have to take to the Camp? What kind of <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothing</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> we have take? Thank you very much for your <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>colaboration</i><c>collaboration</c></NS></i><c>cooperation</c></NS>. <NS type="MA"><c>Yours</c></NS> sincerely Teresa Reina</p>
<p>I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize. It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to say that the only month available <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> me to travel is July. I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is <NS type="MJ"><c>reserved</c></NS> for going with my parents to France. This <NS type="TV"><i>has been scheduled</i><c>was scheduled</c></NS> 3 months ago.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the advertisement <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>it said that</c></NS> discounts <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> available but <NS type="AS"><i>in the tickets I bought they <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> no discount</i><c>there was no discount on the tickets I bought</c></NS>. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>there</c></NS> were on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>. In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have had</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a <NS type="SX"><i>refound</i><c>refund</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> part of the money I wasted there. I would be grateful if you <NS type="MV"><c>could</c></NS> do <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have. It affects everyone who <NS type="AGV"><i>live</i><c>lives</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this planet and every activity <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>done</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I <NS type="RV"><i>spent</i><c>had</c></NS> there. Actually, I read the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> for the show and there were a few mistakes <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>I'm also <NS type="RJ"><i>sorry</i><c>annoyed</c></NS> because I had to wait 45 <NS type="L"><i>mn</i><c>minutes</c></NS> before the <NS type="RN"><i>pieces</i><c>play</c></NS> started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> students) and no discount was <NS type="RV"><i>proposed</i><c>offered</c></NS> or <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>given</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> us. We had to pay £15 each <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>seeing</i><c>to see</c></NS> a miserable <NS type="RN"><i>pieces</i><c>play</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are some (<NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>volontary</i><c>voluntary</c></NS></i><c>deliberate</c></NS>?) mistakes <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> you made. We didn't have a "perfect evening out" at all. That's why I'm asking you <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>giving</i><c>to give</c></NS> us <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> money back.</p>
<p>First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement. Also, it was certain <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me <NS type="M"><c>to be able</c></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>bought</i><c>buy</c></NS> a discount <NS type="AGN"><i>tickets</i><c>ticket</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>cause</i><c>because</c></NS> I am a student. But, it was not <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>availiable</i><c>available</c></NS></i><c>possible</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Second, I went to the theatre <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> exactly seven thirty in the evening. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted <NS type="W"><i>time too much</i><c>too much time</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> waiting. It was not good <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me, <NS type="SX"><i>cause</i><c>because</c></NS> I had only one <NS type="MP"><i>week</i><c>weeks</c></NS> holiday in London. Moreover<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the theatre restaurant was closed with the word "<NS type="RN"><i>Stuff</i><c>Staff</c></NS> vacation" on the front door after the show. It was <NS type="RY"><i>absolutely</i><c>totally</c></NS> different from your leaflet.</p>
<p>For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> a lot of people do not like to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>go</c></NS> shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>varaity</i><c>variety</c></NS></i><c>varieties</c></NS> of products, different prices, different <NS type="FN"><i>quality</i><c>qualities</c></NS>. You <NS type="TV"><i>should walk</i><c>will have to walk</c></NS> miles around <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> store to find what you <NS type="TV"><i>wanted</i><c>want</c></NS>. Yes, there is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> big plus <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> big store of course. You can find everything in one place, <NS type="R"><i>instead of</i><c>in contrast to the</c></NS> small shops which <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> specialised</i><c>specialise</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> one product. And people spend all <NS type="FN"><i>weekends</i><c>weekend</c></NS> walking around shopping <NS type="RN"><i>cities</i><c>centres</c></NS> and high streets in <NS type="RN">trills</NS> to buy something.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Nower days</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>tecnical</i><c>technical</c></NS> progress gets close to us, to <NS type="RJ"><i>usual</i><c>normal</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>custumers</i><c>customers</c></NS>. <NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Internet is one of the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>issue</i><c>issues</c></NS></i><c>solutions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> this problem. Without any <NS type="S"><i>hussle</i><c>hassle</c></NS>, <NS type="RV"><i>seating</i><c>sitting</c></NS> in your <NS type="S"><i>chear</i><c>chair</c></NS> in front of your computer<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>you in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> second</i><c>in a second you</c></NS> can get <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> any shop <NS type="RA"><i>who</i><c>that</c></NS> has <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> internet site<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> most of the big companies have <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>one</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> get all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> information about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> product, get <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> cheaper price and buy it.</p>
<p>My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it. I have been taking photographs since I was 17. I took some lessons and after that I <NS type="TV"><i>have really improved</i><c>really improved</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>Beside</i><c>Besides</c></NS> this, I am very good at playing basketball. I used to play in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> high <NS type="UP"><i>school's</i><c>school</c></NS> team.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>On</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>concert night</i><c>night of the concert</c></NS>, I worked as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for my prize! I <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California.</p>
<p>For the accommodation I would prefer to have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I <NS type="RV"><i>used</i><c>am used to</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>travel</i><c>travelling</c></NS></i><c>staying</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Campsites</i><c>campsites</c></NS> and I love it during summer, <NS type="ID">just to change the customs</NS>!!</p>
<p>Concerning <NS type="R"><i>those</i><c>the</c></NS> activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> two of them. I enjoy swimming and <NS type="RP"><i>anytime</i><c>any time</c></NS> I have <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>opportunities</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to swim I go. My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is better to <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>do</c></NS> one sport and one <NS type="ID">"soft leisure"</NS> and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I <NS type="R"><i>don't know</i><c>am unfamiliar with</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>during</c></NS> my holidays.</p>
<p>"Shopping is not always enjoyable" "Shopping today!" <NS type="MC"><c>If</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>You</i><c>you</c></NS> decide <NS type="CE">to go in town or during holidays to move in a "shopping destination"</NS>, that <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>mean</i><c>means</c></NS> that you need something special for <NS type="RA"><i>you</i><c>yourself</c></NS> or someone else. You have the money and the time <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>that</c></NS> you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> shopping in Paris or Roma and see how <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> the French or Italian fashion <NS type="MV"><c>looks</c></NS> on <NS type="RA"><i>yourself</i><c>you</c></NS>! <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> after that you can <NS type="R"><i>make a stop in</i><c>visit</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Duty-free</i><c>duty-free</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>shops</c></NS> and buy some <NS type="RJ"><i>chipper</i><c>cheap</c></NS> souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with <NS type="MQ"><c>enough</c></NS> money to buy <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>what</c></NS> you always wanted to. But even if shopping <NS type="CE">can means dream</NS> it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend <NS type="AGV"><i>ask</i><c>asks</c></NS> you to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> shopping, it should be boring! <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> you <NS type="MV"><c>may</c></NS> become jealous <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>of</c></NS> him and want him to do <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> quickly! <NS type="RP"><i>or</i><c>Or</c></NS> you <NS type="MV"><c>may</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>are going to</i></NS> get <NS type="RJ"><i>nervous</i><c>irritable</c></NS>! And you can find <NS type="M"><c>that there are</c></NS> too <NS type="CQ"><i>much</i><c>many</c></NS> people in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shops, it is too hot or you <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>your</i><c>the</c></NS> right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! <NS type="RP"><i>or</i><c>Or</c></NS> you decide <NS type="X"><i>to not spend</i><c>not to spend</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> money <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> shopping today, but <NS type="R">in front of the shop</NS>. What is going on??</p>
<p>I am writing to you about your <NS type="RN"><i>theatre</i><c>production</c></NS>: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>one</i><c>actor</c></NS> who played very <NS type="DY"><i>bad</i><c>badly</c></NS>. Secondly, the musical should start <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing <NS type="IV"><i>happend</i><c>happened</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement <NS type="R"><i>when nothing is</i><c>that are not</c></NS> true? And finally, I would <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> had my dinner after this <NS type="DJ"><i>disappointment</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> musical and <NS type="S"><i>thougt</i><c>thought</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS>, it was closed!</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>This</i><c>There</c></NS> are too many <NS type="IJ"><i>negatives</i><c>negative</c></NS> points for one evening. I am afraid<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>that</c></NS> I want my money back. I hope you do not disappoint <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this point.</p>
<p>'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a <NS type="S"><i>tabu</i><c>taboo</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>subject</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> me and my friends. We have discussed <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> it a lot of times. I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>dout</i><c>doubt</c></NS></i><c>doubts</c></NS> when somebody said<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> clothes and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> fashion so much again. We have so many <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of clothes and <NS type="AGN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>behind</i><c>from</c></NS> our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes <NS type="IJ"><i>moderner</i><c>more modern</c></NS> so that you <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> walk in them anymore.</p>
<p>I didn't tell you, but I helped <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this concert just <NS type="ID"><i>by a chance</i><c>by chance</c></NS>. A friend of <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>mine</c></NS> gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said "yes" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life.</p>
<p>Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some <NS type="RJ"><i>stressed</i><c>stressful</c></NS> situations. However, <NS type="RD"><i>these</i><c>those</c></NS> days were <NS type="S"><i>unforgatable</i><c>unforgettable</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case.</p>
<p>Wait for a sunny day, take a look <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>at</c></NS> your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping <NS type="MN"><c>trip</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I will be very happy to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> because in that <NS type="RN"><i>date</i><c>month</c></NS> I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask <NS type="S"><i>permition</i><c>permission</c></NS> from my <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>boss</c></NS>. At the same time, <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> is my birthday</i><c>my birthday is in July</c></NS>, so it would be nice to <NS type="FV"><i>celebrated</i><c>celebrate</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> there.</p>
<p>You are never going to believe what I did last month<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when <NS type="S"><i>sudently</i><c>suddenly</c></NS> a man <NS type="TV"><i>stop</i><c>stopped</c></NS> us saying that he was looking for people to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert and they <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> going to pay us five pounds an hour. We <NS type="S"><i>sed</i><c>said</c></NS> yes <NS type="S"><i>inmidiatly</i><c>immediately</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I nearly shouted <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>happines</i><c>happiness</c></NS> when they told us that<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> Luis Miguel was <NS type="RV"><i>doing</i><c>giving</c></NS> the concert<NS type="RP"><i>, he</i><c>. He</c></NS> is my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> singer.</p>
<p>The concert was on a <NS type="RP"><i>sunday</i><c>Sunday</c></NS> and we had to work <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the back of the <NS type="S"><i>stadge</i><c>stage</c></NS>, doing all sorts of things like <NS type="S"><i>colecting</i><c>collecting</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>rubish</i><c>rubbish</c></NS> and helping other people <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> working there. We <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> so close to him<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I will never forget that day. Since then, <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow" that has been <NS type="RV"><i>presented</i><c>performed</c></NS> in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, I have to say that the advertisement <NS type="R"><i>was</i><c>promised something</c></NS> totally different <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to take</i><c>taking</c></NS> part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the principal point: it started <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes <NS type="FY"><i>later</i><c>late</c></NS>. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> you could explain <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me why.</p>
<p>The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good <NS type="RN"><i>aspects</i><c>things</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> my life, like the <NS type="RN"><i>facility</i><c>potential</c></NS> to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my cab TV and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>comodity</i><c>commodity</c></NS></i><c>commodities</c></NS></i><c>convenience</c></NS> can <NS type="FV"><i>led</i><c>lead</c></NS> us, in the future, to a completely "cold" world, because of the distance <NS type="W"><i>between people that can be <NS type="RV"><i>caused</i><c>created</c></NS></i><c>that can be created between people</c></NS>. <NS type="AGQ"><i>Another</i><c>Other</c></NS> bad points can be mentioned, like <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>polution</i><c>pollution</c></NS> for example.</p>
<p>About the different activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we like them all, but If I <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>have to choose</c></NS> two I <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>opt for</c></NS> sailing and tennis. In the summer I'm sailing <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes. I'm not very good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> but I can practise on my <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you about your question. <NS type="ID"><i>At first</i><c>Firstly</c></NS>, I would like to <NS type="UV"><i>go</i></NS> travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because before <NS type="SX"><i>them</i><c>then</c></NS> I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my <NS type="FN"><i>study</i><c>studies</c></NS>.</p>
<p>You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest <NS type="IN"><i>good</i><c>goods</c></NS> and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> you bought something then you could find it is a little bit <NS type="MY"><c>more</c></NS> expensive than the other shop. Both cases <NS type="TV"><i>are often happened</i><c>often happen</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> shopping.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Mr Smith<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and I think that you've lied to <NS type="UD"><i>such</i></NS> naive <NS type="AGN"><i>tourist</i><c>tourists</c></NS> like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the <NS type="AGN"><i>part</i><c>parts</c></NS> and we only had different<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>pityful</i><c>pitiful</c></NS> ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> forty-five minutes. It is a shame! I ought not to talk about the restaurant<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>which was</c></NS> closed for no apparent reasons</p>
<p>To begin with, I'd like to underline how the <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>importance</c></NS> of technology has increased <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>in</c></NS> a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the <NS type="MN"><c>beginning of</c></NS> economic prosperity<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> many goods like <NS type="FN"><i>TV</i><c>TVs</c></NS>, <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="UP"><i>washing-machine</i><c>washing machine</c></NS></i><c>washing machines</c></NS>, etc. became cheaper and <NS type="FJ"><i>available</i><c>more available</c></NS>. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with the <NS type="S"><i>developpment</i><c>development</c></NS> of satellite <NS type="MN"><c>communication</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life?</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology <NS type="AGV"><i>influence</i><c>influences</c></NS> me is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>through</c></NS> my work: the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> has become such an incredible tool, I can <NS type="UV"><i>make</i></NS> research <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>into</c></NS> everything I want, find <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> for lectures<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> or <NS type="S"><i>exercices</i><c>exercises</c></NS>. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge.</p>
<p>You have sent me a letter about the competition <NS type="M"><c>and the</c></NS> first prize I have won. You asked me <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> some further information.</p>
<p>First, I'd like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July at any time from the first to the <NS type="RP"><i>30st</i><c>30th</c></NS> because of my vacation period. I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>myself</c></NS>.</p>
<p>This book <NS type="RV"><i>stays</i><c>remains</c></NS> one of the best <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>american</i><c>American</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>litterature</i><c>literature</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>book</i></NS>. It is <NS type="RV"><i>classified</i><c>classed</c></NS> as one of the ten books that should <NS type="RV"><i>figure</i><c>be</c></NS> in your own library. But it is also the most famous short story <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> Ernest Hemingway. Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it <NS type="RV"><i>allows</i><c>is</c></NS> a deep <NS type="S"><i>reflexion</i><c>reflection</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>oldness</i><c>age</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Before answering your letter (which I have just <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS>) about the prize <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the competition I recently won, I'd like to <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>say</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> thank you very much for giving me the chance of <NS type="SX"><i>gong</i><c>going</c></NS> to the USA. It is just a dream come true!</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>am recently spending</i><c>have recently spent</c></NS> a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> couple of things.</p>
<p>Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I <NS type="TV"><i>always got</i><c>have always got</c></NS> on very well. We always go to the same school, and <NS type="UV"><i>he's</i><c>he</c></NS> often <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> more friends than I do, and <NS type="RP"><i>everytime</i><c>every time</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>he's</i><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>always</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>introduce</i><c>introduces</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>them to me</i><c>me to them</c></NS>. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any <NS type="S"><i>secreats</i><c>secrets</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> anyone, even himself.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>thirdly</i><c>Thirdly</c></NS>, there was no discount <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>on</c></NS> my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired.</p>
<p>With my friend Miko <NS type="RA"><i>we</i><c>I</c></NS> looked for <NS type="W"><i>a little job <NS type="U"><i>during a</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>week-end</i><c>weekend</c></NS></i><c>a little weekend job</c></NS> and one evening we met a guy who wanted to <NS type="RV"><i>buy</i><c>sell</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> drinks <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the pop concert and so we told him that we <NS type="TV"><i>were agree</i><c>agreed</c></NS> to help him at the bar.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful <NS type="UP"><i>week-end</i><c>weekend</c></NS>: we were opposite <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the singers and we <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> every concert without buying any tickets <NS type="UN"><i>entry</i></NS>! (<NS type="RP"><i>we</i><c>We</c></NS> were <NS type="RV"><i>include</i><c>part</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the staff of the concert<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>)</p>
<p>At the end we <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> 1200<NS type="UP"><i>. -</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>benefice</i><c>profit</c></NS> and each <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> us <NS type="TV"><i>take</i><c>took</c></NS> 400<NS type="UP"><i>. -</i></NS> for himself</p>
<p>I felt very upset about <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> advertisement was <NS type="DY"><i>totaly</i><c>totally</c></NS> different <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS> the musical show. Firstly, I could not buy a discount ticket as you mentioned. Secondly, the show started at 20:15 <NS type="U"><i>p.m<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></i></NS> instead of 19:30 <NS type="U"><i>p.m</i></NS>. Thirdly, <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> theatre restaurant was <NS type="UV"><i>being</i></NS> closed. But the worst thing is the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove.<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> It was really <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>let me down</i><c>letdown</c></NS>!!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. <NS type="UC"><i>Although</i></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> Pat is very smart and intelligent. She <NS type="AGV"><i>like</i><c>likes</c></NS> to talk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> other people. She has <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>open-mind</i><c>open mind</c></NS>. So, she <NS type="MV"><c>has</c></NS> got many <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Lily was one of her best <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>before</i><c>for</c></NS> three <NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS>. She enjoyed sharing <NS type="S"><i>everthing</i><c>everything</c></NS> with Pat<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> whatever <NS type="U"><i>what</i></NS> it was. Nick was <NS type="MP"><i>Lily</i><c>Lily's</c></NS> husband. Her husband <NS type="TV"><i>was being</i><c>had been</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>fried</i><c>fired</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>last</i><c>previous</c></NS> year. Lily felt very nervous about their financial <NS type="FN"><i>problem</i><c>problems</c></NS> and their future<NS type="UP"><i>. As</i><c> as</c></NS> they <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>getting</i><c>get</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> a baby. She told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Pat about what had happened in her family<NS type="UP"><i>. And</i><c> and</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> she was worried. Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other <NS type="MN"><c>people</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>what</i></NS> about his private <NS type="MN"></NS>. She told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Pat that she didn't want <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> other people <NS type="FV"><i>know</i><c>to know</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> it except her. Pat also promised not to tell other people.</p>
<p>But <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>one</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>gathering</i></NS> party, their <NS type="FN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to show their concern, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> they went to ask about Nick and <NS type="RV"><i>send</i><c>give</c></NS> him <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> sympathy. This <NS type="RV"><i>let</i><c>made</c></NS> Nick very <NS type="S"><i>embrassed</i><c>embarrassed</c></NS> and <NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>felt</c></NS> hurt. Finally, they got <NS type="S"><i>seperated</i><c>separated</c></NS>.</p>
<p>. I would like to travel only <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because I would be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>schools</i><c>school</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>holydays</i><c>holidays</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS> and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>would be</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>boring</i><c>annoying</c></NS>?! And when the sun is shining you are <NS type="DJ"><i>relax</i><c>relaxed</c></NS> and you feel good.</p>
<p>. From the list below, the two activities I will choose are <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> and sailing. Tennis because I play <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> and I am classed 15-5. I like <NS type="W"><i>very much <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS></i><c>tennis very much</c></NS> because it is <NS type="R">a technical</NS> and physical sport. And you need <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>strategie</i><c>strategy</c></NS> to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind, <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> the ball becomes <NS type="S"><i>incontrolable</i><c>uncontrollable</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> totally different actor. As it is said in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>according to</c></NS> the programme it started at 20.15, but that <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>is</c></NS> not the end of the story<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> in your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets<NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> was not true! I was <NS type="W"><i>not still</i><c>still not</c></NS> very disappointed, because I hoped that I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> have a good meal with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> glass of wine in the restaurant, <NS type="M"><c>which I could have</c></NS> according to your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but what <NS type="W"><i>did I</i><c>I did</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>realised</i><c>realise</c></NS>, it was closed, because the chef was in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> hospital.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>Everyday</i><c>Every day</c></NS> we keep in touch <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>via</c></NS> technology. We have microwaves that help us to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>make</c></NS> our <NS type="FN"><i>meal</i><c>meals</c></NS> quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>make</c></NS> our <NS type="FN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> easier.</p>
<p>To answer your questions, I would like to tell you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>my travel can be possible only</i><c>I can only travel</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because I will <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>be studying for</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>Cambrigge</i><c>Cambridge</c></NS> exam till 1 July.</p>
<p>And would it be possible to do <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>swimm</i><c>swim</c></NS></i><c>swimming</c></NS> and <NS type="RN"><i>surf</i><c>surfing</c></NS>. I am very good <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> swimming. I <NS type="TV"><i>done</i><c>have been doing</c></NS> it <NS type="ID"><i>since I <NS type="S"><i>remeber</i><c>remember</c></NS> me</i><c>for as long as I can remember</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>surf</i><c>surfing</c></NS> I am not good at all. I have been <NS type="S"><i>driming</i><c>dreaming</c></NS> about this <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> since I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was</c></NS> 10 years old.</p>
<p>I would like to know <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> how many <NS type="S"><i>peopl</i><c>people</c></NS> will stay with me <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> the tent, and <NS type="M"><c>do I</c></NS> have <NS type="UT"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>to take</c></NS> with me <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> special clothes for <NS type="UV"><i>doing</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="SX"><i>serf</i><c>surf</c></NS></i><c>surfing</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> because I am a <NS type="S"><i>studant</i><c>student</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>therefore</i><c>so</c></NS> I only have holidays in this part of the year.</p>
<p>The activities that I want to do <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall <NS type="RC"><i>as well as</i><c>and</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>use</i><c>used</c></NS> to play it very well. On the other hand I <NS type="X"><i>don't know almost <NS type="S"><i>nothin</i><c>nothing</c></NS></i><c>know almost nothing</c></NS> about <NS type="RN"><i>surf</i><c>surfing</c></NS> but I would like to learn and to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>do</c></NS> the sport because I think it <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> cool.</p>
<p>There are people that <NS type="AGV"><i>loves</i><c>love</c></NS> going <NS type="U"><i>to the</i></NS> shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> buying things. Some doctors say that <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>buy</i><c>buying</c></NS></i><c>shopping</c></NS> without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a <NS type="RJ"><i>compulsory</i><c>compulsive</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>buyer</i><c>shopper</c></NS>. He can't stop buying things<NS type="RP"><i>, he</i><c>.  He</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>spend</i><c>spends</c></NS> all his money buying things that he sometimes <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> use. I think this <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.</p>
<p>I can only travel in July because I <NS type="TV"><i>had already booked</i><c>have already booked</c></NS> and fully paid for a <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RP"><i>middle-east</i><c>Middle East</c></NS> holiday</i><c>holiday <NS type="M"><c>in the</c></NS> Middle East</c></NS>, from 25th <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> July till <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> end of August. If you can arrange my departure time <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> 1st of July it <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="DJ"><i>convenience</i><c>convenient</c></NS> for me.</p>
<p>I want to do <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> two activities while I am at the camp: <NS type="RP"><i>Sailing</i><c>sailing</c></NS> and photography. I have great experience <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> sailing. I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey. And I have <NS type="UV"><i>done</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> certificate <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> using <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> radio (VHF). I have <NS type="S"><i>knowladge</i><c>knowledge</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> navigation, engine <NS type="MN"></NS>, ropes and knots<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and <NS type="M"></NS> sails as well.</p>
<p>I like shopping but I had a bad experience <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>a</c></NS> recent shopping <NS type="MN"><c>trip</c></NS>. I went out <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>to get some</c></NS> shopping and to get some ideas about new <NS type="UN"><i>brand</i></NS> computers and <NS type="M"></NS> products. First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I went to a local shop but <NS type="R"><i>I couldn't find</i><c>they didn't have a big</c></NS> enough selection of products.</p>
<p>Do I have to bring some cash <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>with</c></NS> me? Do you think <NS type="DN"><i>travel <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>chaque</i><c>cheque</c></NS></i><c>cheques</c></NS></i><c>traveller's cheques</c></NS> would be more <NS type="RJ"><i>secure</i><c>safe</c></NS>? I <NS type="W"><i>also would</i><c>would also</c></NS> like to get some information about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> weather. What <NS type="RV"><i>does</i><c>is</c></NS> it like in July over there?</p>
<p>The activities I would like <NS type="W"><i><NS type="SX"><i>mot</i><c>most</c></NS> to do</i><c>to do most</c></NS> are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I am quite good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my <NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS>, so that is an activity I have to <NS type="RV">learn</NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I <NS type="X"><i>hadn't</i><c>didn't have</c></NS> a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>, the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was £20 and there <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> any <NS type="AGN"><i>discount</i><c>discounts</c></NS>! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I <NS type="X"><i>hadn't</i><c>didn't have</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> great fun, so I ask for <NS type="MD"><c>that</c></NS> money back. <NS type="DA"><i>Your</i><c>Yours</c></NS> faithfully</p>
<p>But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's <NS type="S"><i>cousine</i><c>cousin</c></NS>. They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream. So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they <NS type="TV"><i>had know</i><c>knew</c></NS> her feelings <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything <NS type="RY"><i>forever</i><c>ever</c></NS>.</p>
<p>But to add to this I had to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>join</c></NS> a long queue to get a <NS type="MP"><i>full price</i><c>full-price</c></NS> ticket when <NS type="UY"><i>instead</i></NS> I had brought my student card <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> the purpose of getting <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist.</p>
<p>The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> sanitary reasons.</p>
<p>I would like to have my two weeks with you in July, as it will be during my summer holiday<NS type="MP"><i> in</i><c>. In</c></NS> addition <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> that<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it is said to be the best season there. I will join in <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> the swimming group and the photography group. Both of them are my hobbies<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I have won some prizes in my school <NS type="FN"><i>competition</i><c>competitions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> them. Therefore, I am quite confident about them.</p>
<p>Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show "Over the Rainbow", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> its advertisement <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>tell</i><c>tells</c></NS></i><c>promises</c></NS> us.</p>
<p>To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who <NS type="TV"><i>I've</i><c>I'd</c></NS> never heard anything <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS>, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>do</i><c>does</c></NS></i><c>has</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a <NS type="RN"><i>shame</i><c>disgrace</c></NS>.</p>
<p>So, it's very important to be a person <NS type="R"><i>than</i><c>who</c></NS> can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the world is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> true and loyal friendship. Then, we have to be <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>the</c></NS> best secret keepers <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> possible, or we will end <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> like Ali and Pat.</p>
<p>I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely <NS type="S"><i>dissapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>by</c></NS> the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to <NS type="M"><c>have a</c></NS> drink before I <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>went</c></NS> to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset <NS type="UY"><i>much</i></NS> at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> that actor was going to <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>be changed</c></NS> to another <NS type="L"><i>guy</i><c>man</c></NS>. This thing shouldn't <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>have</c></NS> happened.</p>
<p>My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed <NS type="MV"><c>to do</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes <NS type="MP"><c>-</c></NS> whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> any time <NS type="M"><c>we want</c></NS>. Of course we can go out <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> the classroom <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> any time.</p>
<p>But some schools in my country don't allow <NS type="L"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> things. One of the rules <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> my friend's school is <NS type="M"><i>not</i><c>you are not allowed</c></NS> to drink <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> eat <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> during a class. And the students have to wear <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> uniforms, so they can't <NS type="FV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> their clothes.</p>
<p>Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> my house <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>by</c></NS> 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule!</p>
<p>One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter. All <NS type="MD"><c>her</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>fathers</i><c>father's</c></NS> things were missing. They could not <NS type="S"><i>believ</i><c>believe</c></NS> their eyes. They read the letter and slowly went <NS type="RT"><i>onto</i><c>into</c></NS> the kitchen. Maria <NS type="TV"><i>bought</i><c>had bought</c></NS> his <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> food and she <NS type="TV"><i>throw</i><c>threw</c></NS> it <NS type="UY"><i>away</i></NS> into the bin. How <NS type="W"><i>he could</i><c>could he</c></NS> have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years. They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot. Now everything was over. She went to <NS type="S"><i>skool</i><c>school</c></NS>, but she could not <NS type="R"><i>pick the material up</i><c>follow the lessons</c></NS> as <NS type="DY"><i>easy</i><c>easily</c></NS> as she used to. So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat. She was so understanding.</p>
<p>Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>should</c></NS> have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>the equipment</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>mentenance</i><c>maintenance</c></NS>. You should have let us <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>such</i><c>that</c></NS> information in advance.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>in</i><c>In</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>addittion</i><c>addition</c></NS>, I <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> go <NS type="SX"><i>tot</i><c>to</c></NS> Britain <NS type="W"><i>to see her by plane</i><c>by plane to see her</c></NS>. Before the plane was <NS type="RV"><i>invested</i><c>invented</c></NS>, I suppose it might <NS type="TV"><i>take</i><c>have taken</c></NS> several months to visit Britain by ship. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> present, it takes just 12 hours by plane.</p>
<p>I am writing to you to thank you <NS type="UY"><i>very much</i></NS> for the <NS type="RN"><i>price</i><c>prize</c></NS> you're giving me. This is the first time <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my life that I won anything like that. When I <NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS> your <NS type="SX"><i>latter</i><c>letter</c></NS>, I could not <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>am</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>in</c></NS> reply <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA.</p>
<p>About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July <NS type="S"><i>becase</i><c>because</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> holidays each year and <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the other months I will be very busy <NS type="S"><i>becase</i><c>because</c></NS> my workmates will take holidays <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> these months.</p>

<p>Thank you for organising the programme <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the trip to London. There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and <NS type="W"><i>especially they are</i><c>they are especially</c></NS> looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London.</p>
<p>To sum up, nobody wants <NS type="W"><i>to be revealed their private life</i><c>their private life to be revealed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.</p>
<p>It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules <NS type="RT"><i>then</i><c>to</c></NS> Polish schools but <NS type="RP"><i>may be</i><c>maybe</c></NS> we might find <NS type="S"><i>sth</i><c>something</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i><NS type="RP"><i>incomon</i><c>in comon</c></NS></i><c>in common</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>?!</i><c>.</c></NS></p>

<p>Thank you for the letter. I was very <NS type="DJ"><i>please</i><c>pleased</c></NS> when I knew that I had won the first prize. I would like to go there only in July, please<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I have a holiday in July. For accommodation I would <NS type="UV"><i>rather</i></NS> prefer log cabins because <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="AGA"><i>it's</i><c>they is</c></NS></i><c>they are</c></NS> more comfortable than tents. And I don't have to worry about the weather. For two activities, <NS type="MT"><c>regarding</c></NS> the first one<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> can I <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>do</c></NS> Tennis, please<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I'm very good <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> tennis. I used to play a lot when I was a student. <NS type="MT"><i>The</i><c>Regarding the</c></NS> second one<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> can I <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>do</c></NS> Photography, please<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>this's</i><c>this is</c></NS> my hobby. And my dad just bought me a new camera. So <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="UP"><i>this's</i><c>this is</c></NS></i><c>this</c></NS> will be my first chance <NS type="U"><i>that I can</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>to use</c></NS> it.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>First</i><c>The first</c></NS> time, when I saw the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the newspaper, I really <NS type="RV">appreciated</NS>. I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible. <NS type="R">Coming an hour earlier is the proof of my feeling</NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the advertisement<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I <NS type="TV"><i>have received</i><c>received</c></NS>, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept <NS type="S"><i>wainting</i><c>waiting</c></NS> for it to start for half an hour. And there were no discounts available either, unlike <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>what</c></NS> was written in the same advertisement.</p>
<p>I am writing to you about my complaints <NS type="U"><i>of mine</i></NS> about the musical show <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> your <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I <NS type="TV"><i>have watched</i><c>watched</c></NS> a week ago, during my stay in London.</p>
<p>That evening, the problems started with the tickets... <NS type="RT"><i>On the contrary with</i><c>Unlike</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>what was stated in</c></NS> the advertisement<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that was published <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International <NS type="MP"><i>Student</i><c>Student's</c></NS> Identity <NS type="RP"><i>card</i><c>Card</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the show <NS type="TV"><i>has started</i><c>started</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>after</c></NS> a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed. Another problem was the <NS type="W"><i>starring male actor</i><c>male actor <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>starring</i><c>starred</c></NS></c></NS>: the <NS type="MP"><i>well known</i><c>well-known</c></NS> and talented actor<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> mentioned in the advertisement was replaced <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> restaurant, which was <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>supposed</c></NS> to be open and available for meals after the show<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> but it was closed.</p>
<p>In my opinion the clothes of the world, <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>in</c></NS> a <NS type="MP"><i>century</i><c>century's</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>time</c></NS>, will be styled in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be "out".</p>
<p>First, I would like to travel during July. <NS type="M"><i>Because</i><c>This is because</c></NS> my college will finish <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August. Second, I prefer to stay <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> a log cabin. I usually stay <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> a tent during camping. Actually, I don't like <NS type="FN"><i>tent</i><c>tents</c></NS> so much. Therefore, I am interested in staying <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> a log cabin. Third, I chose painting and golf as activities. I learned painting when I was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> school student. <NS type="RY"><i>Specially</i><c>In particular</c></NS>, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> golf club when I went to university in Japan.</p>
<p>I am very keen on photography so I <NS type="S"><i>definetely</i><c>definitely</c></NS> will choose this as one of my activities <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love <NS type="DN"><i>sea-sports</i><c>water sports</c></NS> and their <NS type="S"><i>chalenges</i><c>challenges</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Thank you for the letter you have sent recently. It was a surprise to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> that I won the first prize. The <NS type="AGN"><i>reasons</i><c>reason</c></NS> I am really writing, <NS type="RP"><i>However</i><c>however</c></NS>, is to give you some details <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> my trip to California.</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the <NS type="MP"><i>125</i><c>125th</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>aniversary</i><c>anniversary</c></NS> of the city, the <NS type="S"><i>Coun</i><c>County</c></NS> Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band "Five" arrived <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>building</c></NS> the stages and <NS type="M"></NS> sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> when he said: "O.K.<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do." My job was to leave some leaflets <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> shops, restaurants and <NS type="M"><c>on the</c></NS> streets.</p>
<p>I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a Detective course. I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study. Agatha <NS type="MP"><i>Christies</i><c>Christie's</c></NS> stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent. It's <NS type="S"><i>estimulating</i><c>stimulating</c></NS> to read them.</p>
<p>One of the stories will be read on the radio next week. I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> many challenges <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> your new <NS type="S"><i>carreer</i><c>career</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would like to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the excellent programme that you have prepared. I think that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is such a good programme<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>From <NS type="SX"><i>any</i><c>my</c></NS> point of view</i><c>In my opinion</c></NS>, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the bedroom just <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa.</p>
<p>Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very <NS type="RJ"><i>important</i><c>great</c></NS>, they will probably consist <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> making the <NS type="CN"><i>houseworks</i><c>housework</c></NS> easier. The <NS type="RJ"><i>cleanest</i><c>clearest</c></NS> example is to compare a house from the <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>beginings</i><c>beginnings</c></NS></i><c>beginning</c></NS> of the 20th century with our <NS type="FN"><i>house</i><c>houses</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> balance then, I think that the houses that we <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> see <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> films won't really exist.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS> your letters and I am going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the trip.</p>
<p>I would like to go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. <NS type="MD"><i>Other</i><c>The other</c></NS> reason is<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather <NS type="FN"><i>condition</i><c>conditions</c></NS> will be suitable for camping. I prefer to <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS> in tents <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>rather than</c></NS> log cabin because sleeping in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature. Every night I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> out of the small tent <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> the nice <NS type="S"><i>enviroment</i><c>environment</c></NS> outside the tent. <NS type="R"><i>Although</i><c>Also</c></NS>, <NS type="RV"><i>living</i><c>staying</c></NS> in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be <NS type="RJ"><i>aware</i><c>careful</c></NS> about insects so I've bought so many <NS type="FN"><i>insects</i><c>insect</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>repellant</i><c>repellants</c></NS>. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and <NS type="MV"><c>go</c></NS> swimming. When I was in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> fourth form, I got the first prize in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit <NS type="S"><i>disapotted</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or <NS type="S"><i>secound</i><c>second</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>price</i><c>prize</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I had to help them behind the <NS type="RN"><i>state</i><c>stage</c></NS>, while they were <NS type="FV"><i>get</i><c>getting</c></NS> dressed. I had to keep things in place and <NS type="S"><i>cheakd</i><c>check</c></NS> that the microphones <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> working properly. Although the work was not <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>heavey</i><c>heavy</c></NS></i><c>hard</c></NS>, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>signature</i><c>autograph</c></NS></i><c>autographs</c></NS> and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the <NS type="RN"><i>state</i><c>stage</c></NS> and dance with them. I was really <NS type="S"><i>embarassed</i><c>embarrassed</c></NS> because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> the very <NS type="FJ"><i>good</i><c>best</c></NS> experience I have ever had. I <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> really <NS type="TV"><i>enjoy</i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> the concert. <NS type="MD"><i>Thing</i><c>The thing</c></NS> that I particularly <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>liked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> the concert <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is another <NS type="MP"><i>well known</i><c>well-known</c></NS> band. I really want to have that experience again.</p>
<p>I am writing to you <NS type="RP"><i>inconnection</i><c>in connection</c></NS> with your programme <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> spending three days in London. I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>between</c></NS> 10.00 - 19.00. I would be <NS type="S"><i>greatful</i><c>grateful</c></NS> if you could <NS type="RV"><i>arrange</i><c>include</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>shows</i><c>show</c></NS> in your programme.</p>
<p>In my <NS type="S"><i>opionion</i><c>opinion</c></NS>, I think you should <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>organised</i><c>organise</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>event</c></NS> in the afternoon instead of going <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> shopping and move the <NS type="IV"><i>shoping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>time</i><c>slot</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>I think I would like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="TV"><i>I've just finished</i><c>I'll have just finished</c></NS> my course at that time, and I can have a short <NS type="AGN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> <NS type="R">in these days</NS>. It will be very nice for me.</p>
<p>Another thing is when you <NS type="TV"><i>shopping</i><c>shop</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a busy street, <NS type="UV"><i>seem</i></NS> like <NS type="RP"><i>oxford st</i><c>Oxford St</c></NS> in London<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>thief</i><c>thieves</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> there<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>. They</c></NS> will steal <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> money<NS type="RP"><i>, that's</i><c>. That's</c></NS> so dangerous.</p>
<p>When I saw your advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you <NS type="TV"><i>have written</i><c>wrote</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement. But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time.</p>
<p>Yesterday Larry suggested going to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted <NS type="S"><i>immidiately</i><c>immediately</c></NS>. I was <NS type="UT"><i>like</i></NS> walking <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the clouds <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I <NS type="TV"><i>promised</i><c>had promised</c></NS> Pat <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>that I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>help</i><c>would help</c></NS> her with her history homework. She came <NS type="RY"><i>near</i><c>up</c></NS> to me and said "Ready for this evening? Don't forget <NS type="FV"><i>bringing</i><c>to bring</c></NS> your history books." She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to tell her something. Then I explained what <NS type="TV"><i>has</i><c>had</c></NS> happened that morning. She <NS type="RV"><i>was about to</i><c>was going to</c></NS> cry. "I see. You <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>are choosing</c></NS> Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend." After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell <NS type="W"><i>this anyone</i><c>anyone this</c></NS>. She said OK angrily.</p>
<p>After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>enterance</i><c>entrance</c></NS> there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told <NS type="MA"><c>them</c></NS> that I promised my Mom to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>stay in</c></NS> with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my <NS type="UP"><i>bedroom's</i><c>bedroom</c></NS> door I burst into tears. I don't know how long I cried...</p>
<p>Next morning I went to school again. Everyone at the school <NS type="TV"><i>was knowing</i><c>knew</c></NS> about my love <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> Larry including him. Pat was the only person who <NS type="TV"><i>knew</i><c>had known</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very <NS type="DJ"><i>surprise</i><c>surprised</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>won</i><c>win</c></NS> this prize. About the information, I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it's only the month <NS type="MC"><c>when</c></NS> I have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> vacation. It's very difficult to change it. About the accommodation at Camp California<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> prefer tents because I like the <NS type="RN"><i>nature</i><c>countryside</c></NS> and I like to listen <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the birds. At the camp I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> like to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>play</c></NS> tennis and golf. My level in <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> two activities is medium<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I never <NS type="RV">practise</NS> them <NS type="AGA"><i>all</i><c>both</c></NS>. I would like to ask you some <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>Specially</i><c>In particular</c></NS>, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries <NS type="RT"><i>all around</i><c>in</c></NS> the world.</p>
<p>Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the fabulous Programme you have offered. These changes will not affect the <NS type="RN"><i>contacts</i><c>contents</c></NS> of the programme itself.</p>
<p>The task was not easy, <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic <NS type="S"><i>algoritms</i><c>algorithms</c></NS> and databases but anyway we decided to do it<NS type="MP"><i> there</i><c>. There</c></NS> was nothing to lose.</p>
<p>I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>of</c></NS> our stay in London<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and would like to thank you.</p>
<p>I am amazed <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the prize in your competition. I am looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information.</p>
<p>Another point is <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> now you don't need to go out <NS type="U"><i>just for</i></NS> shopping. You can buy a lot of products <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my <NS type="MP"><i>6 year old</i><c>6-year-old</c></NS> son had to pay <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> full price. Then, even if we could enter <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>room</i><c>theatre</c></NS>, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than <NS type="TV"><i>expects</i><c>expected</c></NS>. Indeed, we are still waiting <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> Danny Brook who was not in the <NS type="RN"><i>piece</i><c>play</c></NS>. And last, at the end of the <NS type="RN"><i>program</i><c>performance</c></NS>, we would <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>have liked</c></NS> to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.</p>
<p>You asked me when <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to travel? <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to travel<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> only in July because in <NS type="RP"><i>august</i><c>August</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> must go to my <NS type="MP"><i>grandmother</i><c>grandmother's</c></NS> and help <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> her to gather a harvest of <NS type="FN"><i>fruits</i><c>fruit</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>i'd</i><c>I'd</c></NS> prefer <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>to take</c></NS> a tent because it is more romantic and exciting <NS type="FV"><i>spend</i><c>to spend</c></NS> nights in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> with the tent <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> can go to <NS type="S"><i>enougher</i><c>another</c></NS> place <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the camp. <NS type="UC"><i>But when</i><c>When</c></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>is going to rain</i><c>rains</c></NS> it is not comfortable, but I like it. <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="RP"><i>i'm</i><c>I'm</c></NS></i><c>I</c></NS> want to do <NS type="UQ"><i>such</i></NS> activities <NS type="SX"><i>likes</i><c>like</c></NS> basketball<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> think it is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>teenagers</i><c>teenager's</c></NS> game. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="RP"><i>i'm</i><c>I'm</c></NS></i><c>I</c></NS> like painting because <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> like to paint <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature, sea, <NS type="S"><i>moutains</i><c>mountains</c></NS>. <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="RP"><i>i'm</i><c>I'm</c></NS></i><c>I</c></NS> often go to <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> exhibitions of paintings of modern artists. But <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> like different <NS type="RN"><i>stiles</i><c>styles</c></NS> of art. <NS type="UV"><i><NS type="RP"><i>i'd</i><c>I'd</c></NS></i><c>I</c></NS> think I'll enjoy this <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>i'm</i><c>I'm</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>lookind</i><c>looking</c></NS> forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your answers. <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> hope to see you soon. Bye</p>
<p>I am very happy to have won a two-week trip <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work. Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip.</p>
<p>I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>win</i><c>winning</c></NS> the competition. I believe I have the appropriate <NS type="FN"><i>qualification</i><c>qualifications</c></NS> to stay two weeks at camp California. It <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> be wonderful to see you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, I am very keen <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> sports<NS type="RP"><i>. Specially</i><c>, specially</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> sailing and swimming. Anyway I am <NS type="W"><i>hard working for the <NS type="RN"><i>word</i><c>world</c></NS> cup at sailing</i><c>working hard at sailing for the world cup</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> you.</p>
<p><NS type="TV"><i>Did</i><c>Do</c></NS> you remember the computer <NS type="RN"><i>curse</i><c>course</c></NS> that we took together<NS type="MP"><i> it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was very useful to <NS type="S"><i>clasifay</i><c>classify</c></NS> each person <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert. So keep in touch.</p>
<p>I will definitely go to the festival next year, too. To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could <NS type="RV">welcome</NS> my comments <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of June.</p>
<p>A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world would never believe that in my opinion<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> shopping is really not always enjoyable.</p>
<p>But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day <NS type="W"><i>looking <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> my mother</i><c>with my mother looking</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>through</c></NS> a huge department-store.</p>
<p>Firstly, you did not tell the truth about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>lead</c></NS>. The advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook<NS type="RP"><i>, unfortunately</i><c>. Unfortunately</c></NS> there was someone else - an actor <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> I do not like and if I <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> known that he was going to be <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> I <NS type="S"><i>woud</i><c>would</c></NS> not have <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>gone</c></NS> to see him.</p>
<p>In fact<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> modern technology was already very popular and <NS type="S"><i>comonly</i><c>commonly</c></NS> used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life <NS type="RY"><i>rapidly</i><c>suddenly</c></NS>. But I am also sure<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> the very <NS type="DN"><i>beging</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of my day. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water<NS type="RP"><i>, next</i><c>. Next</c></NS> I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the <NS type="RN"><i>ideas</i><c>results</c></NS> of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my <NS type="DN"><i>travel-holiday</i><c>holiday</c></NS> only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July.</p>
<p>Last, I have no experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>travelling</c></NS> abroad. Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. Which clothes should I take? <NS type="RP"><i>May be</i><c>Maybe</c></NS> there are some occasions <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>when</c></NS> I have to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> myself. As <NS type="W"><i>above mentioned</i><c>mentioned above</c></NS>, please <NS type="RV">take care</NS> to give me more information, and if you'd like to know more, please telephone me for further discussion.</p>
<p>It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million. I went to school there for twelve years. Many people <NS type="TV"><i>are saying</i><c>say</c></NS>: "When you have a son, send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> the best opportunity. There are all kinds of facilities <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>which</c></NS> you can imagine.</p>
<p>There are a lot of folk stories <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from around</c></NS> the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I would like to tell you one of them. This story is about a man and his three sons. This story happened a long time ago. The man was old and his sons were young.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will be on <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school. I would really prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I love sleeping outdoors and listening <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> noises from outside.</p>
<p>I was promised that the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw <NS type="UY"><i>just</i></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> that was completely <NS type="DJ"><i>difference</i><c>different</c></NS> from <NS type="M"></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>brochar</i><c>brochure</c></NS>. To make the matter worse, I <NS type="TV"><i>was travelling</i><c>had travelled</c></NS> to London to see this famous <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> but I didn't see any shows <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>him</c></NS>. It <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> me a bit angry.</p>
<p>According <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>brochour</i><c>brochure</c></NS>, <NS type="AS"><i>it was started to show</i><c>the show would start</c></NS> at 19.30 p.m. but it <NS type="TV"><i>was started</i><c>started</c></NS> at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and <NS type="M"><c>it was</c></NS> very <NS type="S"><i>anoying</i><c>annoying</c></NS>. More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any <NS type="FN"><i>discounts</i><c>discount</c></NS>. I had to pay full <NS type="S"><i>prise</i><c>price</c></NS>.</p>
<p>One day, I <NS type="TV"><i>was falling</i><c>fell</c></NS> in love with <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> closest <NS type="S"><i>freind</i><c>friend</c></NS>. I went out with him sometimes and we were happy. My <NS type="RP"><i>boy <NS type="S"><i>freind</i><c>friend</c></NS></i><c>boyfriend</c></NS> was very handsome, clever and very polite. We were <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>stedy</i><c>study</c></NS></i><c>studying</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the same class at school and he also <NS type="IV"><i>knowed</i><c>knew</c></NS> Pat as well. Personally, I wanted to keep <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>serets</i><c>secret</c></NS> because I <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> afraid that we might <NS type="TV"><i>have <NS type="IV"><i>splited</i><c>split</c></NS></i><c>split</c></NS> up. And I would like to make sure that he <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>relly</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>love</i><c>loved</c></NS> me. My <NS type="RP"><i>boy <NS type="S"><i>freind</i><c>friend</c></NS></i><c>boyfriend</c></NS> told me that he wanted to surprise his <NS type="S"><i>freind</i><c>friend</c></NS> in his class when <NS type="ID"><i>the times <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>comes</i><c>come</c></NS></i><c>came</c></NS></i><c>the time came</c></NS>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wanted to share this <NS type="S"><i>felling</i><c>feeling</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> someone else but I needed to keep <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> very secret. I felt unhappy sometimes.</p>
<p>I felt very angry <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> Pat and I shouldn't have told her about my <NS type="RP"><i>boy friend</i><c>boyfriend</c></NS>. I felt regret but <NS type="M"><c>it was</c></NS> too late<NS type="MP"><i> it</i><c>. It</c></NS> wasn't <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> secret <NS type="RP"><i>any more</i><c>anymore</c></NS> now.</p>
<p>As I may choose the two activities I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>do</c></NS> during my <NS type="DN"><i>staying</i><c>stay</c></NS> at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography. I have been taking singing <NS type="RN"><i>classes</i><c>lessons</c></NS> since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it. On the other hand, I am a beginner <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> photography skills.</p>
<p>One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it. The other activity I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>do</c></NS> is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>playing</c></NS> for four years.</p>
<p>Hello girl<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> how are you doing <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> days<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> great<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially last weekend <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>concert of Backstreet Boys</i><c>Backstreet Boys concert</c></NS>. It was so exciting.</p>
<p>They were giving two concerts<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> one <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Friday and the other one <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Saturday<NS type="MP"><i> they</i><c>. They</c></NS> invited me to go on <NS type="RP"><i>friday</i><c>Friday</c></NS>. This is what happened: when I <NS type="TV"><i>arrive</i><c>arrived</c></NS> they told me that I was helping <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> backstage with the scenery<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the <NS type="S"><i>courtines</i><c>curtains</c></NS> (opening and closing) when Nick came <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> to me and <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> me to go on stage with him<NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because this is the only month <NS type="MY"><c>off</c></NS> given to me by my employer. I would prefer to have a log cabin because I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> sleep in a tent (it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back). Concerning the two activities I have to choose, I would prefer to swim and play tennis (I have a good level <NS type="M"><c>of proficiency</c></NS> in each <NS type="AGN"><i>sports</i><c>sport</c></NS>).</p>
<p>Third, you need to know which sport I want to <NS type="RV"><i>to practise</i><c>to do</c></NS>. I would <NS type="DV"><i>choice</i><c>choose</c></NS> photography and tennis. In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera... (I guess that you shouldn't borrow <NS type="R"><i>some</i><c>one</c></NS>!<NS type="MP"><c>)</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> tennis, I <NS type="TV"><i>play</i><c>have played</c></NS> for eight years and I <NS type="R"><i>am used to</i><c>used</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>sit</i><c>to sit</c></NS></i><c>to enter</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>competition</i><c>competitions</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know <NS type="M"><c>that I</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>have</c></NS> won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, <NS type="R"><i>call</i><c>all</c></NS> the information you need to complete the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>partecipation</i><c>participation</c></NS></i><c>enrolment</c></NS> procedure. I would like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Cornell University: <NS type="R"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> school is closed <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the <NS type="M"><c>type of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> I prefer is <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>a</c></NS> tent. <NS type="RP"><i>there</i><c>There</c></NS> are two main reasons for <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the <NS type="RJ"><i>relative</i><c>related</c></NS> activities: <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="RP"><i>building-up</i><c>building up</c></NS></i><c>putting up</c></NS> the tent, cooking <NS type="R">on camp</NS> and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the <NS type="W"><i>camp daily life</i><c>daily life of the camp</c></NS> (the tent, the <NS type="RN"><i>sleep</i><c>sleeping</c></NS> bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> water <NS type="FN"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> and I am <NS type="W"><i>a quite</i><c>quite a</c></NS> good <NS type="RN"><i>guitar</i><c>guitarist</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> singer<NS type="RP"><i> -</i><c>.</c></NS> Some questions: <NS type="RP"><i>What</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>about</i><c>is</c></NS> the average temperature at the camp <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July? What are the <NS type="FJ"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> clothes to <NS type="RV"><i>use</i><c>wear</c></NS> at the camp? How much money <NS type="R"><i>may be useful</i><c>will I need</c></NS> at the camp?</p>
<p>I will be very glad to <NS type="S"><i>partecipate</i><c>participate</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> your camp!</p>
<p>I do not know if it is possible to make any <NS type="AGN"><i>change</i><c>changes</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> this plan but we saw an ad in "Time Out" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very <NS type="S"><i>convinient</i><c>convenient</c></NS> - March 14 -, and it is on <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there.</p>
<p>Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another <NS type="RN"><i>chance</i><c>time</c></NS> to go to the Science Museum <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> any other day, but this show is just <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>wouldn't</i><c>won't</c></NS> cause a <NS type="RN"><i>trouble</i><c>problem</c></NS> to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
<p>My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>let</c></NS> you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the London theatre.</p>
<p>I thought <NS type="RA"><i>she</i><c>we</c></NS> could <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>put on</c></NS> a show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend, <NS type="MV"><c>to see</c></NS> if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. <NS type="S"><i>programes</i><c>programmes</c></NS>. She loved the idea and said she had <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="IJ"><i>differents</i><c>different</c></NS></i><c>various</c></NS> shows so <NS type="M"><c>I could</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to decide</i><c>decide</c></NS> which <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> be the most suitable. I told her to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>call</c></NS> me <NS type="U"><i>a phone cold</i></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to reply <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter <NS type="UJ"><i>concerned</i></NS> about the <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> at Camp California in the U.SA <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>which is</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month.</p>
<p>About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="SA"><i>practicing</i><c>practising</c></NS></i><c>doing</c></NS> it <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> 5 years so I want to <NS type="ID"><i>keep on it</i><c>keep at it</c></NS>. The other activity that I chose is painting<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not as <NS type="RJ"><i>well</i><c>good</c></NS> as I want, nevertheless I think I can <NS type="S"><i>inprove</i><c>improve</c></NS> my skills during this course.</p>
<p>2 - They also think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that <NS type="MT"><c>through</c></NS> filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as "one-to-one" lessons, people who see this video<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> will <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>become</c></NS> interested <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> knowing more about the school<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> few English schools have this sort of <NS type="AGN"><i>classes</i><c>class</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> this trip. Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions.</p>
<p>I'm writing this letter to <NS type="RV"><i>express</i><c>explain</c></NS> the reasons <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> our disappointment <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> that evening.</p>
<p>When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the theatre restaurant and it was closed without <NS type="MA"><c>anyone</c></NS> giving any reason <NS type="U"><i>for it</i></NS>.</p>
<p>With reference to our trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London, <NS type="DT"><i>in name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> all of us, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special <NS type="S"><i>atention</i><c>attention</c></NS> in <NS type="UV"><i>have</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>organised</i><c>organising</c></NS> a good programme to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn about</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> interesting and cultural <NS type="RN"><i>points</i><c>places</c></NS> in London.</p>
<p>We have been very excited about this and <NS type="S"><i>coincidentely</i><c>coincidentally</c></NS> we have found another option to add <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> our programme, certainly if <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> agree with <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. We <NS type="TV"><i>have thought</i><c>thought</c></NS> that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main <NS type="FN"><i>transformation</i><c>transformations</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>nowdays</i><c>nowadays</c></NS> in England <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>concerning</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>fashions</i><c>fashion</c></NS>, <NS type="RP"><i>Leisure</i><c>leisure</c></NS>, sports and <NS type="DN"><i>style of life</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS>.</p>
<p>However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>it is</c></NS> your decision <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>changing</i><c>to change</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>a little bit our programme</i><c>our programme a little bit</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> would suggest just <NS type="W"><i>on Tuesday afternoon <NS type="X"><i>no</i><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>doing</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>shop</i><c>shopping</c></NS></i><c>not going shopping on Tuesday afternoon</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> everything else could stay the same. We are really satisfied <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> sightseeing by bus, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion <NS type="MN"><c>Show</c></NS> and <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> will be free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> dangerous and <NS type="RJ">poor</NS> way and I don't know how, but he <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>was able to</c></NS> persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my 25th birthday. I was at home <NS type="R"><i>making <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>myself</c></NS> up</i><c>putting my makeup on</c></NS> before <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> to a restaurant with my friends and, <NS type="S"><i>sudenlly</i><c>suddenly</c></NS>, he rang the bell<NS type="RP"><i>, he</i><c>. He</c></NS> was so <NS type="RJ"><i>nervous</i><c>tense</c></NS> with a gun in his hands and <NS type="W"><i>no longer I could speak</i><c>I could no longer speak</c></NS><NS type="MP"><i> he</i><c>. He</c></NS> took me out with him.</p>
<p>I had tried to think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to <NS type="FV"><i>scared</i><c>scare</c></NS> me and he forced me to buy <NS type="S"><i>cocain</i><c>cocaine</c></NS> using my cheques. I didn't want <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> I've never <NS type="TV"><i>approve</i><c>approved</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> his <NS type="W"><i><NS type="FV"><i>deal</i><c>dealing</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>with the</i></NS> drug</i><c>drug dealing</c></NS>, but I couldn't do it <NS type="DY"><i>different</i><c>differently</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The first problem concerned the main actor <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the show. Although it was written in the show's <NS type="S"><i>addvertisement</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.</p>
<p>It was also written in the show's <NS type="S"><i>addvertisement</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> that there would be discounts available <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets. However, there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not any.</p>
<p>I am writing to you about an incident <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>occurred</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> which was <NS type="RV"><i>presented</i><c>put on</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre during my week's holiday in London.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>An other</i><c>Another</c></NS> thing is that there was <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> any discount available so we <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> a lot of money <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>such</i></NS> a bad show.</p>
<p>DANNY BROOK is one of my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>actor</i><c>actors</c></NS> so I decided to buy a ticket <NS type="RC"><i>even if</i><c>even though</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>cancel</i><c>had to cancel</c></NS> my <NS type="S"><i>apointment</i><c>appointment</c></NS> on that day at <NS type="RP"><i>18=30</i><c>18.30</c></NS> and <NS type="S"><i>aslo</i><c>also</c></NS> <NS type="R">notice of price discount impressed me</NS>. However, when I <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>got</c></NS> to the theatre, you <NS type="X"><i>didn't anything not only</i><c>not only didn't have any</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>discount</i><c>discounts</c></NS> but also <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>apporogize</i><c>apologize</c></NS></i><c>had to apologize</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> us for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>dalay</i><c>delay</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> starting <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> musical. In addition <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>after</c></NS> the musical because the <NS type="S"><i>restrant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>was</c></NS> closed. It made me so <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>dissapoint</i><c>disappoint</c></NS></i><c>disappointed</c></NS> and angry.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>taking</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>benefit</i><c>advantage</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available.</p>
<p>Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> I had never heard <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>would be</c></NS> impossible to <NS type="RV"><i>fine</i><c>find</c></NS> another with the same <NS type="RN"><i>features</i><c>characteristics</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>supposed</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>it is</i><c>to be</c></NS> very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense!</p>
<p>I am writing to <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> about the trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London.</p>
<p>The next thing - I would prefer to spend all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> nights in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent, so I can move it to the place <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> will <NS type="W"><i><NS type="FY"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>suite</i><c>suit</c></NS> me</i><c>suit me best</c></NS>. <NS type="UP"><i>-</i></NS> I like to wake up with a view <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> mountains, <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>remind</i><c>reminds</c></NS> me <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> my 5 <NS type="MP"><i>years</i><c>years'</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> climbing.</p>
<p>Also I enjoy walking and photography. I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>filled</c></NS></i><c>have filled</c></NS> two albums <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> birds and flowers <NS type="UN"><i>life</i></NS>.</p>
<p>If you <NS type="TV"><i>would ask</i><c>were to ask</c></NS> me, I prefer my friends to do all <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>shoping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> for me<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> aware of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> big <NS type="RN"><i>lines</i><c>queues</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>check point</i><c>checkpoint</c></NS></i><c>checkout</c></NS>, crowds of people, noise... And <NS type="UP"><i>of'course</i><c>of course</c></NS> not all shops have good <NS type="DN"><i>conditionering</i><c>air conditioning</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote '<NS type="S"><i>discouts</i><c>discounts</c></NS> available' but they didn't <NS type="M"><c>offer any</c></NS> discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired.</p>
<p>I have <NS type="L"><i>much</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> housework to <NS type="TV"><i>be done</i><c>do</c></NS> from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric <NS type="RN"><i>products</i><c>appliances</c></NS>; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, <NS type="RN"><i>juice</i><c>juicer</c></NS>, fridge. I think I can have my spare time <NS type="RJ"><i>owing</i><c>thanks</c></NS> to these <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS>. For example if I don't have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> washing machine, I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> have to wash all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. <NS type="RT"><i>During</i><c>while</c></NS> the washing machine is whirring, I can <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>have</c></NS> my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them.</p>
<p><NS type="W"><i><NS type="MA"><i>Interesting</i><c>It interesting</c></NS> will be</i><c>It will be interesting</c></NS> to show how the lessons are <NS type="TV"><i>organize</i><c>organized</c></NS>, <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>saing</i><c>saying</c></NS></i><c>showing</c></NS> that we are never doing just one <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> during the class. We should speak about our library<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that it is well furnished <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>several</i><c>many</c></NS> books, <NS type="AGN"><i>tape</i><c>tapes</c></NS> and <NS type="AGN"><i>video</i><c>videos</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called "Over the Rainbow", and I was very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>by</c></NS> it.</p>
<p> It was not such a perfect evening out. I would <NS type="RY"><i>rather</i><c>instead</c></NS> say that it was a very disappointing evening, and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> court!</p>
<p>Every day when I get up I <NS type="TV"><i>am checking</i><c>check</c></NS> if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my mobile phone. They are very <NS type="DJ"><i>usefull</i><c>useful</c></NS> things which sometimes are <NS type="S"><i>nessecary</i><c>necessary</c></NS> to survive.</p>
<p>Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to <NS type="RV"><i>stay</i><c>spend</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Camp California</p>
<p>Secondly, I will be able to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I am a manager so I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> travel another time. Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> sleep on the floor. I would like to sing and <NS type="MV"><c>take</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>photograph</i><c>photographs</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I've done a course <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> photography and I think that I am very good <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> it. <NS type="ID"><i>In the other hand</i><c>On the other hand</c></NS>, I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> sing very well but I would like to do this <NS type="MN"><c>activity</c></NS> there.</p>
<p>A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first <NS type="RN"><i>pay</i><c>paycheque</c></NS> and went to a shopping center to spend my money <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> my credit card. I bought everything I wanted.</p>
<p>That's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the <NS type="SX"><i>sit</i><c>seat</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN">eating-place</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the shopping center that I went <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> that day!</p>
<p>You may be surprised to receive a letter from us. All the students are happy that we will have <NS type="S"><i>othe</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>oppurtinatey</i><c>opportunity</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> to visit London for three days. This trip would <NS type="FV"><i>gives</i><c>give</c></NS> us the <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>chance</c></NS> to see London and to improve <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>english</i><c>English</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>language</i></NS>. We all <NS type="RV"><i>agree to</i><c>like</c></NS> the daily programme <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> the three days. In the morning, we will have the <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>chance</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> to see some of the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="CN"><i>sightseeings</i><c>sightseeing</c></NS></i><c>sights</c></NS> of London by bus, <NS type="RP"><i>For</i><c>for</c></NS> example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery.</p>
<p>It is also normally<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MJ"><c>true</c></NS> that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>regarding</c></NS> their private <NS type="MN"><c>life</c></NS>. Who got married, who got <NS type="S"><i>divorsed</i><c>divorced</c></NS> or who <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>has experienced</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>remarkeable</i><c>remarkable</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>changing</i><c>change</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> his complexion, these are questions<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>who</i><c>that</c></NS> most journalists are interested in.</p>
<p>But what <NS type="MN"><c>kind of</c></NS> life is it<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> when you <NS type="W"><i>even can't</i><c>can't even</c></NS> go to a restaurant <NS type="M"><c>because you</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>being</i><c>are</c></NS> afraid of<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the journalists<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>diserve</i><c>deserve</c></NS> also</i><c>also deserve</c></NS> to have a private life. It is a right <NS type="R"><i>like</i><c>that</c></NS> everybody <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>among</c></NS> us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. <NS type="W"><i>Is it</i><c>It is</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>normally</i><c>normal</c></NS> when you are a star<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that everybody wants to know all about you. We <NS type="S"><i>shoudn't</i><c>shouldn't</c></NS> forget<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media!</p>
<p>I think nobody <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> forgotten<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> where <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> curiosity <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the journalists <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>end</i><c>ends</c></NS></i><c>leads</c></NS>. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>there was</c></NS> the hunting <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> Princess Diana and <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>her</c></NS> friend. I hope that they will <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> punished for what they <NS type="TV"><i>done</i><c>did</c></NS>!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> accommodation I would prefer a tent, as I love nature and I like going camping a lot.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball. I know very little about surfing, it is almost something new for me. I have only <NS type="RV"><i>practised</i><c>done</c></NS> it once. But, <NS type="ID"><i>on the other side</i><c>on the other hand</c></NS>, I am a good basketball player, and I <NS type="RV"><i>practise</i><c>play</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> three or four times a week as I play in the University team.</p>
<p>Hi! How are you? How are you doing at school? I have a terrible cold but I feel OK anyway. I got it two weeks ago <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert, but although I've been to the doctor, I can't get over it <NS type="UY"><i>yet</i></NS>!</p>
<p>It was a marvellous experience<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I really enjoyed working with such a nice team, they were really kind <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> me. And, as if <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> wasn't enough, <NS type="M"><c>I was</c></NS> doing what I love! It's something I will never forget.</p>
<p>I would be very grateful, if you gave me <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> possibility of singing. I've always wanted to learn <NS type="FV"><i>singing</i><c>to sing</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>professionaly</i><c>professionally</c></NS>, but I've never had an <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS>. I'm very keen on swimming, too. Normally, I live <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>by</c></NS> the seaside and I couldn't live without this sport. Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters. <NS type="UN"><i>distance.</i></NS></p>

<p>First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July<NS type="RP"><i>, is</i><c>. Is</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>fine</i><c>okay</c></NS> for you? <NS type="M"><i>Because</i><c>This is because</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the only time I can take <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> holiday is July. I would prefer log cabins<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents.</p>
<p><NS type="L"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the two activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming <NS type="RN"><i>courses</i><c>lessons</c></NS> for four years. And the reason I choose painting is <NS type="TV"><i>it's being</i><c>it's</c></NS> very exciting <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not very good at this <NS type="RN">subject</NS> but I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> improve my painting.</p>
<p>I am a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the FCE class and I am writing to you <NS type="ID"><i>in name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> my class to thank you for the programme <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="DJ"><i>three days</i><c>three-day</c></NS> trip to London that you have prepared for us.</p>
<p>Last week some students <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our class <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March.</p>
<p>For example, <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>all</c></NS> shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.</p>
<p>However, people can't have a good time even <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.</p>
<p>I am writing to express my <NS type="S"><i>dissapointment</i><c>disappointment</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the play "over the rainbow"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is <NS type="RV"><i>performing</i><c>showing</c></NS> at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Circle Theatre.</p>
<p>First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> fifteen <NS type="MN"><c>minutes</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>past after</i><c>late</c></NS>. We arrived at the theatre <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an <NS type="S"><i>agressive</i><c>aggressive</c></NS> employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from <NS type="R"><i>the promise written</i><c>what was promised</c></NS> in the advertisement.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told <NS type="MA"><c>her</c></NS> everything about Lynne Harter, our new <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>collegue</i><c>colleague</c></NS></i><c>classmate</c></NS> at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely <NS type="S"><i>agressive</i><c>aggressive</c></NS>. But I couldn't shut my mouth<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I continued: "You can't believe it<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Pat, she wears trousers like <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>men</i><c>man</c></NS> and green flowery blouses<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>" Of course, my friend and I were laughing <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> half an hour. Two days <NS type="RY"><i>after</i><c>later</c></NS>, when Pat came back to my school<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told <NS type="MA"><c>him</c></NS> everything about Ann1. <NS type="ID"><i>In that precisely moment</i><c>At precisely that moment</c></NS> I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> unhappiness started with Pat and my <NS type="S"><i>reveilled</i><c>revealed</c></NS> secrets.</p>
<p>And sometimes the <NS type="RN"><i>credit card</i><c>cashpoint</c></NS> machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or <NS type="U"><i>even if</i></NS> you have exceeded the limit <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> your credit card.</p>
<p>To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, as it is the only <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>time</c></NS> when I can take my holidays.</p>
<p><NS type="RC"><i>As</i><c>When</c></NS> I was a child, I was very good at basketball, <NS type="W"><i>even one of the best <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my class</i><c>one of the best in my class even</c></NS>. I like playing in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> team and deciding quickly what to do next. These <NS type="RN">reasons</NS> are why I'd also like <NS type="MV"><c>to go</c></NS> sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the <NS type="DJ"><i>atmospherical</i><c>atmospheric</c></NS> conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need.</p>
<p>The first idea about shopping is that buying something will <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>be</c></NS> a pleasure <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the buyer and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for that reason, will be enjoyable.</p>
<p>So, you run to the bank but have to wait <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you <NS type="R">do</NS> as <NS type="DY"><i>quick</i><c>quickly</c></NS> as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest!</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> as I believe <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> is the right type of <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> for going camping<NS type="RP"><i>?</i><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Men tease women <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>for</c></NS> being <NS type="DN"><i>shop-cravers</i><c>shopping addicts</c></NS> and for having shopping as <NS type="R"><i>the nicest</i><c>their favourite</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>passtime</i><c>pastime</c></NS>. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that impression is not always true.</p>
<p>I want you to know <NS type="RQ"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> extraordinary <NS type="RN"><i>moments</i><c>time</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>passed</i><c>had</c></NS> with my friends <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>for</c></NS> only that <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="DY"><i>reasonable</i><c>reasonably</c></NS>-priced</i><c>reasonably priced</c></NS> ticket we <NS type="RV"><i>paid</i><c>bought</c></NS> for <NS type="RQ"><i>all the</i><c>the whole</c></NS> weekend. The festival was very well <NS type="S"><i>organiced</i><c>organised</c></NS> with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. <NS type="ID"><i>On my point of view</i><c>In my opinion</c></NS> the hall <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the rock <NS type="S"><i>concets</i><c>concerts</c></NS> was too small<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RP"><i>you've</i><c>you have</c></NS></i><c>. You have</c></NS> to consider <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>make</i><c>making</c></NS></i><c>booking</c></NS> a <NS type="FJ"><i>big</i><c>bigger</c></NS> one for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> next year because these <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of events are <NS type="RV"><i>concurred</i><c>attended</c></NS> by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> special weekend.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I am really <NS type="S"><i>dissapointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>bout</i><c>about</c></NS> "Over the Rainbow" which I saw the other day <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> my stay in London which your company organized. I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> said the show <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> start at 19:30 <NS type="RC"><i>however</i><c>but</c></NS> it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even <NS type="R"><i>though</i><c>so</c></NS>, I can't understand <NS type="MY"><c>why</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>actor</i><c>actors</c></NS> of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove <NS type="TV"><i>doesn't</i><c>didn't</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>appeared</i><c>appear</c></NS> in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I wanted to make my evening pleasant <NS type="RC"><i>however</i><c>but</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> some <NS type="W"><i>problems of sanitary</i><c>sanitary problems</c></NS>. I explained to you every detail about what happened <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the musical show and I want you <NS type="FV"><i>refund</i><c>to refund</c></NS> my money and send <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me an apology for what <NS type="IV"><i>happenned</i><c>happened</c></NS> there.</p>
<p>When I have a headache I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>ate</i><c>eat</c></NS></i><c>swallow</c></NS> pills, made by technology. I think everything <NS type="RT"><i>round</i><c>around</c></NS> us is thanks <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> technology but we can't forget that <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> things <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> made by us. The human being.</p>
<p>Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it. If we <NS type="AGV"><i>creates</i><c>create</c></NS> guns to protect our homes, others will use <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>steal</i><c>burgle</c></NS> our homes, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> take advantage <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the <NS type="DJ"><i>indefense</i><c>defenceless</c></NS> people. However, the technology never stops, we always search <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> new things because we are made to compete, discover, think <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> things which we don't know.</p>
<p>Plus, it is <NS type="IV"><i>mentionned</i><c>mentioned</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that discounts <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> available<NS type="RP"><i>, in</i><c>. In</c></NS> fact, no discount <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>given</c></NS> to me, <NS type="RC"><i>whereas</i><c>though</c></NS> I am a student and as a student I was <NS type="RV"><i>allowed</i><c>entitled</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> a discount but I paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any <NS type="AGN"><i>discount</i><c>discounts</c></NS> for this show.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that this evening was very far <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to be</i><c>being</c></NS> perfect, and I ask you for my money, <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> I spent <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> this horrible evening in your theatre, back.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> what <NS type="TV"><i>happens</i><c>is happening</c></NS> in <NS type="DN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS></i><c>the world</c></NS>, or search for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> special <NS type="RN"><i>leisure</i><c>hobby</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>to get</c></NS> a quick result.</p>
<p>I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I want to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of <NS type="AGN"><i>events</i><c>event</c></NS>. Secondly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>was written</i><c>wrote</c></NS></i><c>said</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>so</c></NS> in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as <NS type="RN"><i>a <NS type="UP"><i>micro-wave</i><c>microwave</c></NS></i><c>an oven</c></NS> inside.</p>
<p>I joined <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> an expedition <NS type="UN"><i>team</i></NS> in order to explore the Rocky Mountains. We planned a <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>route</c></NS>. We arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN">place</NS> in the morning and started to walk.</p>
<p>I met Pat when we were children. We went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the same school and <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>anything</c></NS> to him. When we finished <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> our primary school we went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the same <NS type="S"><i>secundary</i><c>secondary</c></NS> school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every <NS type="AGN"><i>weekends</i><c>weekend</c></NS>. And when we finished <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>secundary</i><c>secondary</c></NS> school, I decided go to a foreign University. I <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> five years there, although I came <NS type="MY"><c>back</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>all</i><c>every</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>summers</i><c>summer</c></NS> and we continued going out as we <NS type="TV"><i>did</i><c>had done</c></NS> before. When I finished I <NS type="TV"><i>return</i><c>returned</c></NS> to my city to find a job.</p>
<p>To make things <NS type="FJ"><i>worst</i><c>worse</c></NS>, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> that date.</p>
<p>However, the clothes will not be <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>those</c></NS> teenagers <NS type="UV"><i>use</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to wear</i><c>wear</c></NS> nowadays to go to "raves". <NS type="AGA"><i>It</i><c>They</c></NS> will be more beautiful and clean.</p>
<p>This story started when I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> this town with <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> family. We <NS type="TV"><i>come</i><c>came</c></NS> here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires. My mother suggested <NS type="FV"><i>to come</i><c>coming</c></NS> here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us.</p>
<p>I hadn't <NS type="RV"><i>known</i><c>met</c></NS> all of <NS type="R"><i>us</i><c>the family</c></NS> (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) <NS type="RT"><i>up to</i><c>before</c></NS> that day. My uncle, called Paul, <NS type="RV"><i>offered</i><c>invited</c></NS> us to stay with his family <NS type="RT"><i>up to</i><c>until</c></NS> we <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>had</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>build</i><c>built</c></NS> our house.</p>
<p>Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed.</p>
<p>First of all, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet makes my life easier. Some of my friends live <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> overseas<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> keep in touch <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> e-mails<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> is a very good way <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>communicating</i><c>to communicate</c></NS> because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="CN"><i>mails</i><c>mail</c></NS></i><c>e-mails</c></NS> and keep them forever.</p>
<p>Another thing <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> is changing our <NS type="AGN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> is the computer, especially <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet. More and more people are connecting <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>to</c></NS> the net. Soon we won't need to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>leave</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>out from</i></NS> our homes. Now we can buy everything <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>via</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet, we can see what's happening <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Wall Street, we can send mail in <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> easier way, by e-mail<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and many people <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> started to work at home <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> their computers.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your prompt reply and <NS type="RN">improvement</NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to <NS type="RV"><i>hang</i><c>give</c></NS> me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and <NS type="RV"><i>booked</i><c>made</c></NS> train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> good reviews <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> that show and I thought it <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>would be</c></NS> a great <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>event</c></NS> to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late <NS type="MV"><c>starting</c></NS>, we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen <NS type="MY"><c>before</c></NS> and who <NS type="X"><i>seemed not</i><c>did not seem</c></NS> to know <NS type="W"><i>by heart his role</i><c>his role by heart</c></NS>! Shame on you! After that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre <NS type="S"><i>restaurand</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I want <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>hang</i><c>give</c></NS></i><c>to give</c></NS> me my money back and very quickly. <NS type="DA"><i>Your</i><c>Yours</c></NS> faithfully..</p>
<p>You also <NS type="RV"><i>refer</i><c>say</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any.</p>
<p>When I wake up<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if I don't have homework I sit <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> my computer and play different games to <NS type="RV"><i>spend</i><c>occupy</c></NS> my time.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the evenings before I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>got</i><c>get</c></NS></i><c>go</c></NS> to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>via</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>sattelite</i><c>satellite</c></NS>. When I go to bed<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because there are many <NS type="S"><i>mosquitoss</i><c>mosquitoes</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I turn on a special machine with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="RN"><i>pile</i><c>battery</c></NS> like</i><c>battery-like</c></NS> thing in it which kills them.</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you <NS type="RT"><i>relating to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> this matter.</p>
<p>You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> it in August as well - I don't want to <NS type="RV"><i>loose</i><c>lose</c></NS> touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> beginner level. It seems like a good <NS type="S"><i>oportunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to <NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> top of the list. If it <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>were</c></NS> possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me.</p>
<p>I want to complain about your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>theatre</i><c>production</c></NS> 'Over the Rainbow'<NS type="MP"><c>;</c></NS> I had a very disappointing evening.</p>
<p>The secret was that I was in love with Peter <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> my course. I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone.</p>
<p>Yesterday when I arrived <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking <NS type="DY"><i>strange</i><c>strangely</c></NS> at me and <NS type="S"><i>laufhing</i><c>laughing</c></NS>. I felt how I started to blush. In the classroom it became even <NS type="IJ"><i>worser</i><c>worse</c></NS>. People started to <NS type="S"><i>whrite</i><c>write</c></NS> things on the board and <NS type="FV"><i>pointing</i><c>to point</c></NS> at me.</p>
<p>I'm writing to complain <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the musical show "Over the Rainbow". <NS type="TV"><i>I've been recently seeing</i><c>I recently saw</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> in your theatre during my week's holiday in London <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> London's newest and best musical show<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the best</c></NS> I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>had ever seen</i><c>ever see</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because of the good publicity you <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>gave</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>yourself</c></NS> in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong!</p>
<p>Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme: <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS>! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. <NS type="R"><i>Finished</i><c>After</c></NS> the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this <NS type="TV"><i>hasn't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>had been</c></NS> closed: the chef <NS type="RV"><i>went away</i><c>left</c></NS> after he received a phone call!</p>
<p>There <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>could</c></NS> be many things to say about <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS>. Technology is a wide field which <NS type="RV"><i>increases</i><c>expands</c></NS> very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>can</c></NS> say <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> technology has changed our life in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> positive <NS type="MN"><c>way</c></NS> or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we <NS type="MV"><c>can</c></NS> make a phone call with an <NS type="DJ"><i>astonish</i><c>astonishing</c></NS> rapidity, <NS type="R"><i>instead</i><c>whereas</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my grandparents' time it took one month or more to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When <NS type="W"><i>appeared the first car</i><c>the first car appeared</c></NS>, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else <NS type="AGA"><i>he</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>wants</i><c>want</c></NS>! What can I say about <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> television? It allows us to <NS type="RV"><i>keep</i><c>maintain</c></NS> connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which <NS type="TV"><i>happened</i><c>have happened</c></NS> or will happen. In<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the not very <NS type="RJ"><i>far</i><c>distant</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> 1914, <NS type="AGN"><i>parent</i><c>parents</c></NS> sent their sons <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible!</p>
<p>Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress <NS type="TV"><i>caused</i><c>has caused</c></NS> some <NS type="CN"><i>damages</i><c>damage</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the community, not only <NS type="S"><i>phisically</i><c>physically</c></NS>. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power.</p>
<p>Finally, the <NS type="S"><i>restarant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> I would <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>have liked</c></NS> to have dinner with friends after the show was closed<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>against</i><c>contrary to</c></NS> what was announced in the advertisement. Nobody told us <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>reasons</i><c>reason</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>the</i><c>these</c></NS> problems.</p>
<p>The only thing I can say about technology is that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> has driven my life. Modern technology <NS type="ID"><i>attracts my <NS type="S"><i>atention</i><c>attention</c></NS></i><c>captures my imagination</c></NS>, and this is the reason why I have chosen <NS type="W"><i>an electronic <NS type="S"><i>caree</i><c>career</c></NS></i><c>a career in electronics</c></NS>. I <NS type="X"><i>think technology doesn't</i><c>don't think technology</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>change</i><c>changes</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>life style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS>. <NS type="MA"><i>Is</i><c>It is</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>life style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS> or <NS type="RN"><i>necessities</i><c>needs</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> people <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> make technology develop. All <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to <NS type="R"><i>don't waste</i><c>save</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>so many</i></NS> time. But these <NS type="R"><i>ones</i><c>machines</c></NS> bring new problems that must be solved by others.</p>
<p>I don't know how much money I'll need <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the trip <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> what kind of clothes I'll need. Do you have any <NS type="R">night plan</NS>, like going to discos or <NS type="RP"><i>night clubs</i><c>nightclubs</c></NS>? Can you give <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> this <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS>?</p>
<p>Anyway, other alternatives <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> shopping are being created and we can choose <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> not <NS type="FV"><i>waste</i><c>to waste</c></NS> our time shopping.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I was really amazed <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> the <NS type="IN"><i>new</i><c>news</c></NS> that I'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>Respect</i><c>With regard</c></NS> to the date that I would like to travel <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> must be <NS type="U"><i>only on</i></NS> July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I'm going to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>some</c></NS> free time <NS type="U"><i>to do so</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> this date until early August <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>when</c></NS> I will start to work.</p>
<p>Would you be so kind <NS type="MT"><c>as</c></NS> to let me know what kind of weather <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> you have <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July in order <NS type="M"><c>that I can</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to choose</i><c>choose</c></NS> the right <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothing</c></NS> to bring<NS type="MP"><i> and</i><c>. And</c></NS> also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not <NS type="R"><i>cover</i><c>included</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>complaining</i><c>to complain</c></NS> about the last <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS> evening performance <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre. I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this <NS type="RN"><i>changing</i><c>change</c></NS> before <NS type="MN"><c>the performance</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After the show, we decided to go to the restaurant <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> dinner, but it was closed for <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>repairs</c></NS>. Everything was completely different from what you had announced <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement</p>
<p>Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS>. A simple example, we can<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> at the same time<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> wash our clothes <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> a washing machine, record a <NS type="RP"><i>tv</i><c>TV</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS> and talk to someone on the other side of the world. All this in one morning, and the day <NS type="TV"><i>just begins</i><c>has just begun</c></NS>, what <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>doing</i><c>to do</c></NS> next?</p>
<p>Technology allows <NS type="MA"><c>us</c></NS> to have more time <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>distractions</i><c>leisure</c></NS> or <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> other things we really like to <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS>. We can take care of <NS type="RA"><i>whom</i><c>those</c></NS> we love and give them more attention<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> time is not <NS type="W"><i>a really</i><c>really a</c></NS> problem. We will see people differently, <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> more <NS type="DY"><i>calm</i><c>calmly</c></NS>, because we <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>suffer</c></NS> no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more <NS type="RJ"><i>comprehensible</i><c>understanding</c></NS> with others. It is the first step <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>towards</c></NS> a true fraternity.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I need to stay at home in August. I am a college student and I am going to study <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> university this year. I will take my exams in June and have the <NS type="FN"><i>result</i><c>results</c></NS> in August. So I shall stay to prepare for my university.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> English class is going to make a short video about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>school</i><c>school's</c></NS> daily life. The aim of this report is to give <NS type="RQ"><i>the</i><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>suggestion</i><c>suggestions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> which lessons and activities should be filmed.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Topical</i><c>The topical</c></NS> class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more <NS type="RJ"><i>up-dated</i><c>up to date</c></NS>. The teacher <NS type="AGV"><i>use</i><c>uses</c></NS> video<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> pictures to <NS type="RV"><i>show</i><c>teach</c></NS> students about festivals, sports, museums, <NS type="S"><i>ect</i><c>etc</c></NS>. It is popular <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> the students.</p>
<p>Now <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to say</i><c>saying</c></NS></i><c>mentioning</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> this problem to my "friend" Pat. I knew that she <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> close to my brother and that she <NS type="TV"><i>loves</i><c>loved</c></NS> him a lot, so I never thought that things <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> turn <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> like this.</p>
<p>When<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> one day Pat came over to my house<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we started arguing about <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS> things and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> our <NS type="S"><i>fite</i><c>fight</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>suddenly came <NS type="RY"><i>about</i><c>up</c></NS> the subject of my father and his problems</i><c>the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up</c></NS>. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He <NS type="TV"><i>stand</i><c>stood</c></NS> outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>, it was too late. The secret <NS type="TV"><i>was <NS type="S"><i>revilied</i><c>revealed</c></NS></i><c>had been revealed</c></NS>. And now I try to help my brother <NS type="S"><i>beaus</i><c>because</c></NS> I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels.</p>
<p>I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to <NS type="FV"><i>receiving</i><c>receive</c></NS> your letter in which <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> said that I have won the first prize in your competition, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>I am writing to inform <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> university and it will start in August. Is <NS type="UA"><i>there</i></NS> the time I request available? I would also like to ask <NS type="M"></NS> accommodation you offer <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> in <NS type="RN"><i>tens</i><c>tents</c></NS> or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer <NS type="RN"><i>tens</i><c>tents</c></NS>. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning.</p>
<p>In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities. I <NS type="MY"><i>can</i><c>can't</c></NS> wait to do my painting <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers <NS type="MV"><c>will be</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Shopping is not always enjoyable. I don't really like shopping. <NS type="RY"><i>Sometime</i><c>Sometimes</c></NS> when I'm <NS type="RJ"><i>boring</i><c>bored</c></NS> and can't find something else to do<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I go look round <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shops. When I see some clothes in the window I like, I <NS type="UV"><i>would</i></NS> go in and try them <NS type="MY"><c>on</c></NS>. But I always <NS type="AGV"><i>finds</i><c>find</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> not look nice on me. <NS type="R">The other thing I don't like going shopping is</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>articals</i><c>articles</c></NS></i><c>items</c></NS> like rubbish<NS type="RP"><i>. <NS type="FV"><i>Hang</i><c>Hanging</c></NS></i><c>, hanging</c></NS> them <NS type="RP"><i>every where</i><c>everywhere</c></NS> after they <NS type="TV"><i>tried</i><c>have tried</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>them on</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>found</c></NS> that <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS></i><c>did</c></NS> not suit them.</p>
<p>Also <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> weekend shopping<NS type="RP"><i>. You</i><c>, you</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> can't find <NS type="RP"><i>some where</i><c>somewhere</c></NS> to sit down <NS type="DY"><i>comfortaly</i><c>comfortably</c></NS> to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>are</c></NS> all full of people.</p>
<p>However, shopping is <NS type="M"><i>nice</i><c>a nice way</c></NS> to spend <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> leisure time and give yourself <NS type="M"><c>a chance</c></NS> to relax sometimes, but <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> suggest that <NS type="M"><i>never</i><c>you never do it</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the weekend.</p>
<p>According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK <NS type="RP"><i>AND</i><c>and</c></NS> TINA TRUELOVE, but <NS type="S"><i>surprisinggly</i><c>surprisingly</c></NS>, <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS> was <NS type="S"><i>proformed</i><c>performed</c></NS> by a different actor <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>who</i><c>whom</c></NS> I <NS type="W"><i>even didn't</i><c>didn't even</c></NS> know the name. In addition, the show was supposed <NS type="FV"><i>to be started</i><c>to start</c></NS> at 19:30 but it <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>started</c></NS> half <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> hour later, <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>at</c></NS> 20:15.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing is that modern technology <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> made our life easier, for instance <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>ricer</i><c>rice</c></NS> cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is <NS type="FV"><i>putting</i><c>put</c></NS> rice <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> it and switch <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> on, it makes cooking more <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>effeciently</i><c>efficiently</c></NS></i><c>efficient</c></NS>. <NS type="S"><i>Furthmore</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, we <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> use <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want.</p>
<p>Spending a week in London <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> last week, I <NS type="TV"><i>had decided</i><c>decided</c></NS> to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really <NS type="RJ"><i>disappointed</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> evening! Indeed, <NS type="RY"><i>firstly</i><c>first</c></NS>, the <NS type="RN"><i>play</i><c>performance</c></NS> didn't start at 19:30 as it was <NS type="RV"><i>planned</i><c>meant to</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>according to</c></NS> the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15).</p>
<p>Furthermore, <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement I got, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was written that the theatre restaurant was <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS>. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe <NS type="RV"><i>spend</i><c>have</c></NS> a better evening than <NS type="M"><c>I was having</c></NS> at the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>of the show</c></NS> but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were <NS type="RV"><i>indicated</i><c>given</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Indeed, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>modernism</i><c>modernisation</c></NS> helps us to lead a <NS type="FJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS></i><c>more comfortable</c></NS> and better life than before. For example, cars<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> planes are <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> wonderful <NS type="AGN"><i>invention</i><c>inventions</c></NS>! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>a</i><c>one</c></NS> city to <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>one</i></NS> or to travel abroad. People couldn't <NS type="RV">think</NS> of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created. <NS type="RN"><i>Human being</i><c>Mankind</c></NS> became more and more clever and built <NS type="S"><i>wonerful</i><c>wonderful</c></NS> things thanks to his thoughts and his hands.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The communication</i><c>Communication</c></NS> has made many <NS type="RN"><i>progresses</i><c>advances</c></NS> too. Everyone <NS type="RV"><i>gets</i><c>has</c></NS> a television at home. "A machine which talks and shows pictures!" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago. Although there are new machines etc, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>health</i><c>medicine</c></NS> makes many <NS type="DN"><i>discoverts</i><c>discoveries</c></NS> thanks to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>searching</i><c>research</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>into</c></NS> different diseases in order to make the population <NS type="TV"><i>lived</i><c>live</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>older</i><c>longer</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>In</c></NS> the past 100 <NS type="AGN"><i>year</i><c>years</c></NS>, fashion has <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>changed</c></NS> a great deal. <NS type="S"><i>Now a day</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS> clothes <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> designed to be more comfortable. You can just "pop down the road" and go shopping. <NS type="MD"><i>Material</i><c>The material</c></NS> and <NS type="S"><i>coloures</i><c>colours</c></NS> of your <NS type="RN"><i>cloths</i><c>clothes</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> changed since the early <NS type="UP"><i>1900's</i><c>1900s</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>to 2000</i></NS>. <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>Synethetic</i><c>Synthetic</c></NS></i><c>Synthetics</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS></i><c>have been</c></NS> created by <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>scientis</i><c>scientist</c></NS></i><c>scientists</c></NS>. Clothes are now <NS type="MP"><i>mass <NS type="DV"><i>producted</i><c>produced</c></NS></i><c>mass-produced</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>desing</i><c>design</c></NS></i><c>designed</c></NS> by <NS type="S"><i>desingers</i><c>designers</c></NS>.</p>
<p>About the activities <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I can tell you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I like to play <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS> and I <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>play</c></NS> it very <NS type="DY"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS>. Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS>. It's a very <NS type="RJ"><i>favourite</i><c>popular</c></NS> sport <NS type="W"><i>also in our region (area)</i><c>in our region (area) also</c></NS>, but I <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>have</c></NS> never found time to do it. I'm a beginner <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS> you have to know.</p>
<p>Now a question from me to you: <NS type="RP"><i>Is</i><c>is</c></NS> it possible to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the different things <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>credit-card</i><c>credit card</c></NS>? Another question - what <NS type="FN"><i>sorts</i><c>sort</c></NS> of clothes shall I bring with me? Is July a hot and dry month or <NS type="RV"><i>is</i><c>does</c></NS> it <NS type="FV"><i>raining</i><c>rain</c></NS> sometimes?</p>
<p>I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> this will be all I want to know. If there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> any other <NS type="AGN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> your part, please call me or write again.</p>
<p>The concert started on the 15th of <NS type="RP"><i>may</i><c>May</c></NS> and it was a <NS type="L"><i>real</i><c>really</c></NS> great session in our valley. I was so happy when they <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> me to help them with the organisation. I was responsible <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisments</i><c>advertisements</c></NS> and I <NS type="W"><i>had also</i><c>also had</c></NS> to invite the "important <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS>" from our <NS type="S"><i>governement</i><c>government</c></NS>. It was <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> a new job for me, but I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>have done</i><c>did</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS>. I've learned a lot about management and especially <NS type="UP"><i>-</i></NS> how stars <NS type="TV"><i>are living</i><c>live</c></NS>.</p>
<p>However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show <NS type="RY"><i>additionally</i><c>as well</c></NS>. This show takes place at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> this show, not only can we see <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles, but we <NS type="W"><i>also can</i><c>can also</c></NS> enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you <NS type="UV"><i>would</i></NS> accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Few</i><c>A few</c></NS> years ago, we had <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> terrible news of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> death of Lady Diana. She was always <NS type="FV"><i>been</i><c>being</c></NS> <NS type="DV"><i>aftering</i><c>pursued</c></NS> by <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after <NS type="TV"><i>chasing</i><c>being chased</c></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time, she was <NS type="DV"><i>dead</i><c>killed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> car accident. It must be a good example of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> she <NS type="S"><i>definetely</i><c>definitely</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>deserve</i><c>deserved</c></NS> to have a private life as <NS type="R"><i>one of</i><c>a</c></NS> citizen. Human <NS type="FN"><i>right</i><c>rights</c></NS> must <NS type="FV"><i>be existed</i><c>exist</c></NS> for all people.</p>
<p>I am very happy to know I won the prize <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.</p>
<p><NS type="IV"><i>Refering</i><c>Referring</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>to</c></NS> sports<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions. About basketball, I would say I like <NS type="W"><i>it to play</i><c>to play it</c></NS> as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was not as good <NS type="M"><c>at it</c></NS> as <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>I was at</c></NS> swimming but I like it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter and for having <NS type="TV"><i>inform</i><c>informed</c></NS> me about the results of the competition. I also want to congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>exellent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> competition, <NS type="IN"><i>thank</i><c>thanks</c></NS> to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS>.</p>
<p>About the <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS>, I think it would be preferable to do it <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, which is a holiday <NS type="S"><i>periode</i><c>period</c></NS> and so I won't have any <NS type="RJ">special</NS> obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>be</c></NS> closer to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>Stay</i><c>Staying</c></NS></i><c>Spending</c></NS> a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the <NS type="FJ"><i>worse</i><c>worst</c></NS> thing to do, <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="DY"><i>specialy</i><c>specially</c></NS></i><c>especially</c></NS> during a <NS type="RN"><i>trip</i><c>holiday</c></NS>! Moreover <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> would like <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little <NS type="RN">tournaments</NS> of this kind would be <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>greateful</i><c>grateful</c></NS></i><c>great</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Before ending my letter I would like to know <NS type="U"><i>and be told</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="DY"><i>specialy</i><c>specially</c></NS></i><c>in particular</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> what kind of clothes <NS type="UV"><i>should</i></NS> I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Dollars</i><c>dollars</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you to <NS type="RV"><i>explain</i><c>describe</c></NS> some problems <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> your theatre's show<NS type="RP"><i>, first</i><c>. First</c></NS> I have to say to you that there was a different actor <NS type="M"><c>to the one advertised</c></NS> starring <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>act</i><c>play</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>expect</i><c>expected</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the act</i><c>of the play</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>was</i><c>to be</c></NS> Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the <NS type="RN"><i>hour</i><c>time</c></NS> that the <NS type="RN"><i>act</i><c>play</c></NS> started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was <NS type="UP"><i><NS type="FJ"><i>fourteen-year-old</i><c>fourteen-years-old</c></NS></i><c>fourteen years old</c></NS> and I was with my <NS type="RP"><i>bestfriend</i><c>best friend</c></NS>, Pat. We were in a private school, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>looks</i><c>looked</c></NS> like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>we</i><c>us</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>became</i><c>to become</c></NS> good <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> polite girls. <NS type="UD"><i>The life</i><c>Life</c></NS> in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school<NS type="RP"><i>, this</i><c>. This</c></NS> path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good idea <NS type="FV"><i>told</i><c>to tell</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Pat because we could use <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> her, she promised <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me that she <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>kept</i><c>keep</c></NS> the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> a bad experience. </p>
<p>I am writing this letter to you in order to complain <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week; <NS type="RY">concretely</NS> on Friday evening.</p>
<p>First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> your company, which is said to be the best <NS type="RN"><i>exhibitor</i><c>producer</c></NS> of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I <NS type="AS"><i>attended <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> the referred day to your theatre</i><c>attended your theatre on the referred day</c></NS> with the aim of having a perfect evening.</p>
<p>This is going to take place on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>march</i><c>March</c></NS> 14 <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> 10.00 to 19.00.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>Every one</i><c>Everyone</c></NS> deserves to be given the right <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> a private life.</p>
<p>Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it. But the main reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my complaint, is that in the <NS type="S"><i>advertistment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>it was</c></NS> said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not.</p>
<p>Nowadays<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with my computer, I can travel <NS type="RY"><i>everywhere</i><c>anywhere</c></NS> in the world, just <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>by having</c></NS> it connected <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> a modem. <NS type="MD"><i>internet</i><c>The Internet</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> changed my life because<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with it, we can do everything at home. For example if <NS type="R"><i>someday</i><c>one day</c></NS> I forgot <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> book, <NS type="AS"><i>with the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> I can find the book inside it</i><c>I can find the book on the Internet</c></NS>, and more information <NS type="MY"><c>too</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I have just <NS type="S"><i>receised</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter and I <NS type="S"><i>thanck</i><c>thank</c></NS> you for your invitation and congratulations. I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> your perfect organisation.</p>
<p>I have given a questionnaire to other students <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my class to know their preferences <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>regarding</c></NS> this <NS type="S"><i>choise</i><c>choice</c></NS> and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is <NS type="RP"><i>Philosophy</i><c>philosophy</c></NS>. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>explaing</i><c>explaining</c></NS> problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the <NS type="RP"><i>sports-activities</i><c>sports activities</c></NS> should be filmed; they express an <NS type="RJ">aggregative</NS> and social way of living <NS type="RP"><i>school-life</i><c>school life</c></NS> and can be useful to <NS type="RV"><i>see</i><c>show</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>and check out</i></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>moviments</i><c>movements</c></NS> of the <NS type="IN"><i>bodys</i><c>bodies</c></NS> during the <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>atletics-school</i><c>athletics-school</c></NS></i><c>athletics school</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>games</i><c>events</c></NS></i><c>school athletics events</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="W"><i>Also the dancing lessons should</i><c>The dancing lessons should also</c></NS> be filmed, <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their <NS type="S"><i>moviments</i><c>movements</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> the actors that <NS type="IV"><i>appeard</i><c>appeared</c></NS> on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets that <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be discounts <NS type="R"><i>for it</i><c>given</c></NS>, but, they didn't <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>give</c></NS> us discounts! With all <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> problems, the only thing that <NS type="ID"><i>led us</i><c>kept us going</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was <NS type="M"><c>the thought of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to eat</i><c>eating</c></NS> something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because <NS type="RN"><i>people</i><c>the staff</c></NS> didn't <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>arrived</i><c>arrive</c></NS></i><c>go</c></NS> to work that day.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>On</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>sunday</i><c>Sunday</c></NS> night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> sister <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>beheave</i><c>behave</c></NS></i><c>behaved</c></NS></i><c>stayed</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>silence</i><c>silent</c></NS> for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, <NS type="TV"><i>know</i><c>knew</c></NS> that I had <NS type="TV"><i>go</i><c>gone</c></NS> out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.</p>
<p>I also would like to talk about your concerts. The concerts are fabulous but the <NS type="FN"><i>problems</i><c>problem</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> these problems?</p>
<p>At home, I'm not allowed to watch television after 8 p.m. I must do my <NS type="RP"><i>home work</i><c>homework</c></NS> when I come back <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> home. I <NS type="W"><i>also must</i><c>must also</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to help</i><c>help</c></NS> my parents <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> home activities<NS type="RP"><i>. For</i><c>, for</c></NS> example<NS type="RP"><i>; <NS type="FV"><i>to clean</i><c>clean</c></NS></i><c>, clean</c></NS> my room and the other rooms, or <NS type="FV"><i>to cook</i><c>cook</c></NS>, etc.... I <NS type="RP"><i>Hope</i><c>hope</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> information will help you,</p>
<p>First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I want you to know I am really happy about the prize. The only problem is that <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> I am a student I can travel only during <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> holidays, in July. <NS type="R"><i><NS type="IV"><i>Refering</i><c>Referring</c></NS> to</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> accommodation I would rather <NS type="TV"><i>to stay</i><c>stay</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I have never <NS type="RV"><i>gone</i><c>been</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> camping <NS type="RC"><i>so</i><c>and</c></NS> I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>try</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the experience</i><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't <NS type="TV"><i>told</i><c>tell</c></NS> you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the pop concert in detail in my last letter <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>As</i><c>A</c></NS> few months ago I <NS type="IV"><i>chated</i><c>chatted</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>via</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> who happened to be one of the <NS type="AGN"><i>member</i><c>members</c></NS> of "Los Pericos". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>give</c></NS> a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> where they were preparing the concert.</p>
<p>The problem was that one of the <NS type="S"><i>technics</i><c>technicians</c></NS> was from England and nobody there spoke <NS type="UC"><i>nor</i></NS> a word <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English.</p>
<p>I have just <NS type="S"><i>recived</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter and I'm very happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> it, especially <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> the competition was so hard.</p>
<p>However, about accommodation, I'd prefer a log cabin, <NS type="S"><i>becouse</i><c>because</c></NS> it is more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> than <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent. All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing, because I'm used to playing tennis <NS type="UT"><i>during</i></NS> every <NS type="AGN"><i>weekends</i><c>weekend</c></NS> and I'm very keen <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> surfing. I'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'm interested <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>law's</i><c>law</c></NS> schools in California<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>. They</c></NS> are very famous here.</p>
<p>Last month I visited Tom, another old friend, and he told me <NS type="R"><i>if I had</i><c>I could</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>worked</i><c>work</c></NS> with him <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> musician at the XZY pop concert. "This is extraordinary", I said.</p>
<p>Firstly, I was very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>embaracing</i><c>embarrassing</c></NS></i><c>embarrassed</c></NS> during the concert, but all the staff were very <NS type="L"><i>kindly</i><c>kind</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> me and Tom too. This <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> the most important experience in my life, I knew all the people, in <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> particular the famous singer "Kos". He is funny and <NS type="RP"><i>easy-going</i><c>easy going</c></NS>. During the concert, I was near the <unknown/> and opposite there was "Pipe" the biggest <unknown/> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world. It's very difficult describing all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>emotion</i><c>emotions</c></NS> I felt. I can only tell <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> had been an important experience for me and for my new songs. Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I <NS type="S"><i>obn't</i><c>won't</c></NS> be able to write <NS type="S"><i>oben</i><c>even</c></NS> this letter <NS type="UY"><i>yet</i></NS>.</p>
<p>TO THE MANAGER OF "THE CIRCLE THEATRE" AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL, I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY, <NS type="R"><i>WHOSE</i><c>AND ITS</c></NS> "SPLENDID ENDING" WAS A WEEK IN LONDON<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> WHILE I WAS THERE, I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN: <NS type="W"><i>THE "OVER THE RAINBOW"</i><c>"OVER THE RAINBOW" THE</c></NS> MUSICAL <NS type="UN"><i>SHOW</i></NS> WAS <NS type="TV"><i>BEING PLAYED</i><c>PLAYING</c></NS> AT YOUR THEATRE, MOREOVER, THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE <NS type="RN"><i>PROTAGONIST</i><c>STAR</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>IN</c></NS> IT. SADLY, I DECIDED TO GO, ALONG WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT THE PROBLEMS STARTED EVEN BEFORE THE SHOW, WHEN WE WANTED TO BUY THE TICKETS. WE ASKED ABOUT "THE DISCOUNTS" THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING <NS type="M"><c>THE TICKETS</c></NS> COULD SAY WAS: WHAT DISCOUNTS? THEN, WE MOVED INSIDE THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN!!, WHILE WE WERE WAITING, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT, AND THEN<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED. BY THE TIME THE SHOW STARTED, WE WERE SO ANGRY THAT THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T ACTING. I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T A PLEASURE FOR US TO SEE THE SHOW, SO I HOPE YOU <NS type="TV"><i>COULD</i><c>CAN</c></NS> GIVE ME OUR MONEY BACK, IF YOU CAN'T, PLEASE, AT LEAST GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION. YOURS FAITHFULLY</p>
<p>TODAY, I CAN <NS type="RV"><i>TAKE</i><c>DO</c></NS> MOST OF MY <NS type="UP"><i>SCHOOL'S</i><c>SCHOOL</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>HOMEWORKS</i><c>HOMEWORK</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>FROM</i><c>WITH</c></NS> THE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND IT DOESN'T <NS type="DV"><i>WEIGHT</i><c>WEIGH</c></NS> MORE THAN AN APPLE! I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS <NS type="AGA"><i>THEY</i><c>IT</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>HAPPEN</i><c>HAPPENS</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>AT</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I HAD NEVER USED <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> INTERNET BEFORE, BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE.</p>
<p>I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="R"><i>a</i><c>I</c></NS></i><c>. I</c></NS> mean we just carried all the instruments <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the musicians to the Club and we put <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> on the stage. After this, we helped <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN">service</NS> bar<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to put</i><c>putting</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>into the fridges all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> drinks and refreshments</i><c>all the drinks and refreshments into the fridges</c></NS>. And that was it! I enjoyed <NS type="W"><i>a lot doing this</i><c>doing this a lot</c></NS> and <NS type="RY">at least</NS> the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. <NS type="S"><i>Marevellous</i><c>Marvellous</c></NS>!</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to talk <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> something, so I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> her bedroom to speak <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> her. She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a party without <NS type="FV"><i>asked</i><c>asking</c></NS> her and that she had to punish me for that. She told me that I had to stay at home <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>the</c></NS> weekend and not <NS type="FV"><i>to go out</i><c>go out</c></NS> with my friends.</p>
<p>When I went <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> my bedroom I <NS type="S"><i>reliased</i><c>realised</c></NS> that Pat had told my mother <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the party, because <NS type="RP"><i>noone</i><c>no one</c></NS> else knew that my mother did not know that <NS type="M"></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>Change <NS type="AGV"><i>weren't</i><c>wasn't</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>a normal situation</i><c>common</c></NS> and Governments didn't invest enough money <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> it. Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be a nice idea to <NS type="S"><i>analize</i><c>analyse</c></NS> these changes and to put limits <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> technology, because I think that the most important <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> is <NS type="MV"><c>to understand</c></NS> our life and <NS type="SX"><i>no</i><c>know</c></NS> the ways we <NS type="MV"><c>can</c></NS> improve it.</p>
<p>The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature. So he <NS type="RV"><i>bares</i><c>bears</c></NS> everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> being injured from keeping <NS type="MN"><c>hold</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> the line <NS type="R"><i>where</i><c>on which</c></NS> the fish is <NS type="R"><i>on</i><c>caught</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The reader feels <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>for</c></NS> him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.</p>
<p>I have gone out <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>onto</c></NS> the street and I have asked <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> people <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> this question. I have <NS type="RV">recollected</NS> all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> answers and I have <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>written</c></NS> this article.</p>
<p>I really think that living in the future will be like living <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the moon<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> very exciting. And people will wear <NS type="S"><i>cibernetic</i><c>cybernetic</c></NS> clothes but <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will <NS type="R"><i>be more enjoyable</i><c>enjoy themselves more</c></NS> than people <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> now because they will have many things to do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, most <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> people in the future will wear glasses. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>That</c></NS> is because sunlight is very bad. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the end <NS type="R"><i>all people</i><c>everyone</c></NS> will be <NS type="DJ"><i>short-sight</i><c>short-sighted</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Well, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature, and the animals!</p>
<p>For <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>. </c></NS> I used to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>enter</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> competitions when I was younger. And for the other <NS type="MN"><c>activity</c></NS> I will <NS type="TV"><i>chose</i><c>choose</c></NS> tennis<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I really enjoy this sport<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not really a good player but I like to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>play</c></NS> tennis <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>in</c></NS> my free time! Since I'm coming <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>in</c></NS> the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me<NS type="RP"><i>, and</i><c>?  And</c></NS> I have another question<NS type="RP"><i>, it's</i><c>. It's</c></NS> about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>cash</c></NS> or <NS type="RN"><i>checks</i><c>cheques</c></NS>?</p>
<p>Well this is <NS type="DY"><i>abosolutly</i><c>absolutely</c></NS> true, <NS type="S"><i>espacially</i><c>especially</c></NS> when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always <NS type="SX"><i>crowed</i><c>crowded</c></NS>, and most of the people are stressed<NS type="RP"><i>, it's</i><c>.  It's</c></NS> crazy. For <NS type="S"><i>exemple</i><c>example</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you go into a <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothes</c></NS> shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>fit</i><c>match</c></NS> their new skirt, so they are looking <NS type="RP"><i>every where</i><c>everywhere</c></NS>, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>have chosen</c></NS>. And you have to wait after <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> to buy it, so finally you <NS type="TV"><i>waited</i><c>have waited</c></NS> so long that you <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>are getting</i><c>have got</c></NS></i><c>have become</c></NS> late, so you get stressed <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS>. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their <NS type="W"><i>name's kids</i><c>kids' names</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> the shopping mall because they <NS type="TV"><i>lost</i><c>have lost</c></NS> them. So you <NS type="TV"><i>are getting</i><c>get</c></NS> a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling<NS type="RP"><i>, if</i><c>.  If</c></NS> I can give you <NS type="R"><i>an</i><c>some</c></NS> advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get <NS type="S"><i>bruses</i><c>bruises</c></NS> because of the woman <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!</p>
<p>Looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your answer.</p>
<p>Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> shopping <NS type="SA"><i>centers</i><c>centres</c></NS> are always busy, <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> people going up and down carrying bags and looking <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>window shops</i><c>shop windows</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> seems <NS type="S"><i>everbody</i><c>everybody</c></NS> is happy.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="CN"><i>hurries</i><c>hurry</c></NS> you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> plastic money<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> shop assistant <NS type="AGV"><i>pass</i><c>passes</c></NS> the credit card through the machine, after <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few seconds <NS type="M"><c>he does it</c></NS> again, and <NS type="M"><c>does it</c></NS> another time <NS type="UY"><i>more</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, suddenly</i><c>. Suddenly</c></NS> his face changes and <NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>says</i><c>tells</c></NS> you that the card is <NS type="DJ"><i>fault</i><c>faulty</c></NS>! No choice<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>:</c></NS> you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad.</p>
<p>I can only travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="AGA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> is the <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS> when I have holidays. I've already talked to my manager, and she said that that's the only <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS> I can have my holidays.</p>
<p>I wish you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>had been</c></NS> there with me helping at a pop concert. I just loved it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was working with <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> music system. You know how good <NS type="RP"><i>I'm</i><c>I am</c></NS> at music<NS type="RP"><i>, anyway</i><c>Anyway</c></NS> I was helping <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> pop concert to get the <NS type="S"><i>corect</i><c>correct</c></NS> sounds<NS type="RP"><i>, at</i><c>. At</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>bigging</i><c>beginning</c></NS> I was <NS type="S"><i>conecting</i><c>connecting</c></NS> all these wires into <NS type="S"><i>spekers</i><c>speakers</c></NS>, music system, <NS type="FN"><i>guitar</i><c>guitars</c></NS> etc... The <NS type="W"><i>particularly bit that I</i><c>bit that I particularly</c></NS> liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> you know how much I love playing guitar<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> and all these video cameras were just filming us. I asked <NS type="SX"><i>on</i><c>one</c></NS> of the <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>camera man</i><c>cameraman</c></NS></i><c>cameramen</c></NS> when they're going to show <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 10 of June, so turn on your tv on <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> date<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>chanel</i><c>channel</c></NS> three, and <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>must</i><c>will</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>seem</i><c>see</c></NS> me there playing <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> guitar<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> AH<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was lovely. These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see <NS type="AGD"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS> pop concert<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="S"><i>beleave</i><c>believe</c></NS></i><c>. Believe</c></NS> me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you'll love it and you might <NS type="RV"><i>use</i><c>play</c></NS> the drums<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I told them that you're really good <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> drums so they want to try you too.</p>
<p>I would rather stay in log cabins than tents. I have some <NS type="RN"><i>pain</i><c>trouble</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>with</c></NS> my back<NS type="MP"><i> therefore</i><c>. Therefore</c></NS> I can't sleep in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> sleeping bag on the ground.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would love to do <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball</i><c>basketball</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Painting</i><c>painting</c></NS> activities while I am at the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS>. I am a member of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> college <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball Team</i><c>basketball team</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which became the best <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball Team</i><c>basketball team</c></NS> of last year. Secondly, I want to do painting<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I am really interested in <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> as a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Art College</i><c>art college</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We all know that she isn't good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time. Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days.</p>
<p>"Are you looking for these?" asked Philip<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> showing the keys <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the car.</p>
<p>Firstly, I wish to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July as I already have plans for June<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer <NS type="FN"><i>vacations</i><c>vacation</c></NS> commences.</p>
<p>Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much.</p>
<p>I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> being received <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> camp California.</p>
<p>I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>took</c></NS> place <NS type="RJ"><i>last</i><c>yesterday</c></NS> evening. None of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> conditions <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>for</c></NS> another actor. As a result it was a disappointing performance. Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> said that it was going to begin at 19:30.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On the other hand</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS>, <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> there <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> any discounts <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="R"><i>sell</i><c>price</c></NS> of the tickets.</p>
<p>In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it <NS type="X"><i>hadn't</i><c>had never</c></NS> existed since there are too many things on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different <NS type="RN"><i>marks</i><c>makes</c></NS>. And it's all the more <NS type="S"><i>tyring</i><c>tiring</c></NS> since you often wait <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> two weeks before <NS type="RV"><i>buying</i><c>getting</c></NS> it. I'm bound to feel <NS type="RJ"><i>nervous</i><c>tense</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> technology and society.</p>
<p>Hoping that I <NS type="TV"><i>did not offend</i><c>have not offended</c></NS> you in any <NS type="FN"><i>ways</i><c>way</c></NS> and that you might take <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> consideration my <NS type="FN"><i>suggestion</i><c>suggestions</c></NS>, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.</p>
<p>Last week, I was on holiday in London, and <NS type="TV"><i>reading</i><c>having read</c></NS> the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (<NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> it <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> said) "a perfect evening out".</p>
<p>Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> she <NS type="TV"><i>had repeated</i><c>repeated</c></NS> to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> her: she <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> do anything to have friends, even betray me.</p>
<p>The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The <NS type="DJ"><i>recreative</i><c>recreational</c></NS> part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. <NS type="DT"><i><NS type="S"><i>Appart</i><c>Apart</c></NS> of</i><c>Apart from</c></NS> that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Mobile</i><c>The mobile</c></NS> phone is a marvellous invention<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but as <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> cigarettes, we should <NS type="RV"><i>right</i><c>write</c></NS> on it<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS></p>
<p>Finally, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the last afternoon, we could visit the museums<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> free time for the students to look round <NS type="RY">here</NS> by themselves.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the conference.</p>
<p>First of all, the efficiency of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>Kasse</i><c>cashier</c></NS> to <NS type="R">take every article's note</NS> by hand. When booking <NS type="RD"><i><NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS></i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>airline</i><c>flight</c></NS>, we can <NS type="CL"><i>just simply</i><c>just</c></NS> make a <NS type="RN"><i>phone</i><c>phone call</c></NS> to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of <NS type="RV">looking up</NS> tons of books to get the information <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> we need, we can very easily search <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> it <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> or on the local network. It's <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very often heard<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that someone<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> who has a <NS type="RJ"><i>special</i><c>rare</c></NS> illness<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>gets</i><c>has</c></NS></i><c>has had</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>operations</i><c>operation</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> a foreign <NS type="AGN"><i>institutes</i><c>institute</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which he <NS type="TV"><i>find</i><c>found</c></NS> via <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. Moreover, with computer <NS type="FN"><i>network</i><c>networks</c></NS>, it <NS type="TV"><i>can be</i><c>is</c></NS> possible <NS type="R"><i>that</i><c>for</c></NS> people <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>to work</c></NS> from home, <NS type="RV">making</NS> projects, <NS type="IV"><i>controling</i><c>controlling</c></NS> operations or <NS type="RV">having</NS> conferences. Lastly <NS type="R">the way of communications</NS> has <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="W"><i>been also</i><c>also been</c></NS> changed</i><c>also changed</c></NS>. Instead of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>tranditional</i><c>traditional</c></NS> <NS type="IN"><i>telecommunication</i><c>telecommunications</c></NS>, we can talk <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS>, <NS type="RV"><i>mail</i><c>e-mail</c></NS> or even see each other with the help of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> computer network.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <NS type="AGN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS> have become a <NS type="U"><i>very essential</i></NS> necessity <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our life, and it's still a young invention, which <NS type="AGV"><i>need</i><c>needs</c></NS> to be improved.</p>
<p>Gaudi conceived <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> this church <NS type="S"><i>n</i><c>in</c></NS> 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it. Since the beginning the work <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>has been</c></NS> interrupted <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> different <NS type="RN"><i>periods</i><c>times</c></NS> and started again. After <NS type="MP"><i>Gaudi</i><c>Gaudi's</c></NS> death <NS type="R">it was critical stop which was fortunately solved</NS> three years later. Nowadays, <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> hard work is being done in order to finish <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I'm very happy to have won <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> your competition. <NS type="TV"><i>I'm never going</i><c>I've never been</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the U.S.A <NS type="R"><i>than</i><c>so</c></NS> I'm very <NS type="RJ"><i>exciting</i><c>excited</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>travel</i><c>visit</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> Camp California. I can <NS type="FV"><i>to come</i><c>come</c></NS> only <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> July because I have to work the other months of <NS type="RP"><i>Summer</i><c>summer</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>As</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> I'd prefer to sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>becaose</i><c>because</c></NS> I like <NS type="IV"><i>beeing</i><c>being</c></NS> outside and <NS type="S"><i>earing</i><c>hearing</c></NS> the noises of the sea.</p>
<p>- <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="SA"><i>math</i><c>maths</c></NS> lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>learn</i><c>learns</c></NS></i><c>teaches</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> his students. We could <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>filmed</i><c>film</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>class room</i><c>classroom</c></NS> too.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> the end we could <NS type="RV"><i>show</i><c>have</c></NS> a comment <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> each student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our class.</p>
<p>I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I <NS type="RV"><i>worked as</i><c>got</c></NS> a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really <NS type="RJ"><i>exciting</i><c>excited</c></NS>. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert.</p>
<p>I learnt lots of thing <NS type="UT"><i>from</i></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>here</i><c>there</c></NS> that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I <NS type="RV"><i>knew</i><c>met</c></NS> lots of people <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> different <NS type="AGN"><i>job</i><c>jobs</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>had</c></NS> a great time.</p>
<p>As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am in charge <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>organise</i><c>organising</c></NS> the conference in my college. Do not worry if Richard did not <NS type="FV"><i>left</i><c>leave</c></NS> you all the information. I am pleased to help you.</p>
<p>We looked <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> every hotel in <NS type="RP"><i>Town</i><c>town</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> trying to give you the best <NS type="S"><i>offerd</i><c>offer</c></NS>. We found two good hotels <NS type="RC"><i>but</i><c>and</c></NS> we decided <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the Palace Hotel. This has the best price that we could find. <NS type="MT"><i>The</i><c>On the</c></NS> conference day our school driver is going to pick you up <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the hotel and take you to the conference.</p>
<p>The <NS type="S"><i>Musseum</i><c>Museum</c></NS> is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco. <NS type="MA"><i>Is</i><c>It is</c></NS> situated <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the top of a little mountain in the "old" part <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> the city. You are able to get there by car or <NS type="R"><i>walking</i><c>on foot</c></NS> and see everything which was made at that time.</p>
<p>First of all, I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>appreicate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS></i><c>congratulate</c></NS> you for organizing such an exciting festival.  It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> this festival <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> much.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to mention <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> reasonably-priced weekend ticket.  It was brillient, because if I had to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> all things <NS type="R"><i>each</i><c>individually</c></NS> I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.  Thank you very much <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> that.</p>
<p>But, even if he was <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> poor, he was <NS type="RY"><i>so</i><c>very</c></NS> good and had a lot of affection <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them.</p>
<p>The following year, when the bird returned <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> his house, he gave him a message.  It was a kind of map that showed the <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>location</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> a lot of money which robbers hid.</p>
<p>People <NS type="S"><i>belive</i><c>believe</c></NS> that the bird was sent <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> heaven.</p>
<p>But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> them!</p>
<p>Unfortunately <NS type="X"><i>I had ever been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the US so I have any idea about</i><c>I have never been to the US so I don't have any idea about</c></NS> how much money I will probably need <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> about what kind of clothes I have to take with me.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Certenly</i><c>Certainly</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>the only fact of</i><c>only the fact of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>have</i><c>having</c></NS> something can <NS type="FV"><i>helps</i><c>help</c></NS> people to be more sure of <NS type="RA"><i>himself</i><c>themselves</c></NS>. In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein <NS type="RN"><i>model</i><c>product</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> a certain kind of <NS type="AGN"><i>people</i><c>person</c></NS> you are cool, but <NS type="W"><i>it is</i><c>is it</c></NS> really so important?</p>
<p>You know that helping you <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> a real pleasure for me<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> really don't have to become flat broke <NS type="RT"><i>because of</i><c>from</c></NS> buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tiny "Statue of Liberty" will be nice. I will finish now as I have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> mountain of work to do. I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>The telephone is a very important invention, which has affected our lives. It is a way for people to communicate although they are <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> two different places. People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life.</p>
<p><NS type="UD"><i>The people</i><c>People</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>use the telephone also</i><c>also use the telephone</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> their personal life. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away. Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone. They are able to give and receive <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> very quickly.</p>
<p>And computers<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> playing <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their <NS type="CN"><i>works</i><c>work</c></NS>. They <NS type="RV"><i>connect</i><c>communicate</c></NS> with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of <NS type="RP"><i>note books</i><c>notebooks</c></NS> and they also had to find places to hide them.</p>
<p>I am writing to express my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the show you <NS type="RV"><i>presented</i><c>put on</c></NS> two weeks ago at your theatre.</p>
<p>As I was spending a <NS type="UP"><i>week-end</i><c>weekend</c></NS> in London<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I took <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>chance</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>too</i><c>to</c></NS> see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I <NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>got</c></NS> to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>having</c></NS> it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been <NS type="DV"><i>posticipated</i><c>postponed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of <NS type="RN"><i>restructuring</i><c>repair work</c></NS>; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> hamburger in a fast-food <NS type="MN"><c>restaurant</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main <NS type="RN"><i>cause of</i><c>reason for</c></NS> Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever <NS type="UP"><i>teen-ager</i><c>teenager</c></NS> and while she was attending <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Secondary School she had many <NS type="RN"><i>troubles</i><c>problems</c></NS> with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would <NS type="W"><i>have never</i><c>never have</c></NS> passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="UP"><i>year-old</i><c>year old</c></NS></i><c>years old</c></NS> but still <NS type="RJ"><i>well-looking</i><c>good-looking</c></NS> and all my <NS type="R"><i>girls</i><c>female</c></NS> school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any <NS type="AGN"><i>girls</i><c>girl</c></NS> felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>class mate</i><c>classmate</c></NS></i><c>classmates</c></NS> and she <NS type="TV"><i>run</i><c>ran</c></NS> away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any <NS type="DN"><i>exitation</i><c>hesitation</c></NS> she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>abuses</i><c>abuse</c></NS> and obliged to resign. The trial was long and <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>received</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> wide coverage <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> media. We live in a small and <NS type="MP"><i>old fashioned</i><c>old-fashioned</c></NS> town and Mr. White was considered a monster: <NS type="RV"><i>loosing</i><c>losing</c></NS> his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> terrified by the darkness which was nearing.</p>
<p>The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, a five star hotel, which offers many facilities. It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The students can get there <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the No 35 bus. They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five <NS type="RN"><i>stations</i><c>stops</c></NS> at Palace Station. The hotel is opposite the station.</p>
<p>On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to. The group can also visit the zoo, the opera or stay and relax <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the college's enormous garden and enjoy the <NS type="RN"><i>settings</i><c>scenery</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Location: The castle is in the city centre <NS type="RJ"><i>nearby</i><c>near</c></NS> an enormous church. <NS type="RA"><i>Someone</i><c>You</c></NS> can get to the city centre <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the No.456 bus and then <NS type="MV"><c>go</c></NS> on foot to the castle.</p>
<p>Activities: At <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> time of the year<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> you will visit Nyremberg, <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the castle are <NS type="TV"><i>taken</i><c>taking</c></NS> place many theatrical plays or concerts</i><c>many theatrical plays or concerts are taking place in the castle</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as <NS type="DJ"><i>usually</i><c>usual</c></NS>, we <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students <NS type="TV"><i>wear</i><c>wore</c></NS> a suit (for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> man) or a skirt (for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> woman). Furthermore, this party <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be in your hotel <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="RJ"><i>following</i><c>previous</c></NS> years. Finally, there are a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="S"><i>mouseum</i><c>museum</c></NS></i><c>museums</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>is</i><c>in</c></NS> our town<NS type="RP"><i>, therefore</i><c>. Therefore</c></NS>, I would suggest going to the frogs museum<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is really <NS type="S"><i>fashinating</i><c>fascinating</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the <NS type="RJ"><i>eldest</i><c>oldest</c></NS> civilisation <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world in one of the <NS type="IJ"><i>modernest</i><c>most modern</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>building</i><c>buildings</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At First</i><c>First</c></NS>, this international student conference has the <NS type="RN"><i>intension</i><c>aim</c></NS> of <NS type="FV"><i>explain</i><c>explaining</c></NS> to students how important <NS type="W"><i>is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> education</i><c>education is</c></NS>. In addition to this, we <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>have chosen</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>luxuery</i><c>luxury</c></NS> Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can <NS type="RV"><i>go</i><c>come</c></NS> by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and <NS type="RV"><i>go out</i><c>get off</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Museum Station. The <NS type="RP"><i>Conference</i><c>conference</c></NS> will <NS type="RV"><i>happen</i><c>be held</c></NS> in the <NS type="RP"><i>Hotel</i><c>hotel</c></NS>, which is <NS type="R">so much easier</NS>.</p>
<p>The <NS type="RP"><i>Conference</i><c>conference</c></NS>, <NS type="R">not being modest</NS>, <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> quite well organized. It will <NS type="FV"><i>starts</i><c>start</c></NS> at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as <NS type="FJ"><i>more comfortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> as possible <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> our students.</p>
<p>However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some <NS type="RN">facilities</NS>. How could a person <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>go</c></NS> from Brazil to Australia <NS type="M"><c>without it</c></NS>? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is <NS type="S"><i>definetely</i><c>definitely</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> by air. <NS type="RT"><i>After</i><c>With</c></NS> this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the <NS type="RN"><i>creators</i><c>inventors</c></NS> who invented <NS type="R">facility things</NS> for us.</p>
<p>First of all the hotel Richard Brown <NS type="TV"><i>has been <NS type="DV"><i>loocked</i><c>looked</c></NS></i><c>has looked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> is the Palace Hotel. <NS type="MP"><i>Its</i><c>It's</c></NS> located close to the main <NS type="RP"><i>trainstation</i><c>train station</c></NS> in our town. It is quite near the conference building. There will be <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>extrabus</i><c>extra bus</c></NS></i><c>extra buses</c></NS> to get there. The bus will pick you up right at your hotel <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>entery</i><c>entry</c></NS></i><c>entrance</c></NS>. The end-of-conference party will be a small dinner for all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> students. You do not have to wear <NS type="S"><i>spezial</i><c>special</c></NS> clothes, just wear what you always wear. If you take your uniform with you it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and wear something else.</p>
<p>Our <NS type="RP"><i>Church</i><c>church</c></NS> is a very famous building <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> our country.

If you want to visit the church, there will be a special guide who <NS type="TV"><i>shows</i><c>will show</c></NS> you <NS type="S"><i>al</i><c>all</c></NS> the things and answer your questions. <NS type="UD"><i>The <NS type="DN"><i>entery</i><c>entry</c></NS></i><c>Entry</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>will be</i><c>is</c></NS> free.</p>
<p>I <NS type="S"><i>receved</i><c>received</c></NS> your letter and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group<NS type="RP"><i>, it's</i><c>. It's</c></NS> nice and quiet. I'm sure you'll be fine here. We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to <NS type="RV"><i>come</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the conference in <NS type="RQ"><i>some</i><c>a few</c></NS> minutes.

At the end-of-conference party <NS type="RA"><i>it'll</i><c>there'll</c></NS> be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, <NS type="RA"><i>it'll</i><c>there'll</c></NS> be some <NS type="S"><i>picturs</i><c>pictures</c></NS> of our college<NS type="RP"><i>, you'll</i><c>.

<p>What would our world be without television? It isn't easy <NS type="FV"><i>giving</i><c>to give</c></NS> an answer <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> this question. Television is an important invention<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>permitted</i><c>has given</c></NS> us <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>a</c></NS> better <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>means</c></NS> of communication. This animated box can give us a lot of <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>coming</i></NS> from all around the world.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is <NS type="M"><c>on the</c></NS> North City Line, <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> yellow line on the map. After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is <NS type="R"><i>for twenty minutes</i><c>twenty minutes away</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS></i><c>. It</c></NS> is <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the conference <NS type="MN"><c>venue</c></NS>.</p>
<p>As a teenager I must <NS type="S"><i>addmit</i><c>admit</c></NS> that there is nothing more enjoyable <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>than</c></NS> shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like <NS type="M"><c>you are</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>flaing</i><c>flying</c></NS>. Choosing <NS type="TV"><i>gave</i><c>gives</c></NS> me such <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>great</c></NS> pleasure because I never have to worry <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>vere</i><c>where</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I <NS type="RV"><i>ought</i><c>have</c></NS> to do is buy and choose. I think that ,,having is a dream'' <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> all of us.</p>
<p>I am glad to <NS type="FV"><i>helping</i><c>help</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the organisation of the international student conference.</p>
<p>I am writing a report, <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> which <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> will describe <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> you the most important building <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my town.</p>
<p>The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda". It is <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>old big</i><c>big old</c></NS> house of a rich lord in the middle of the town. <NS type="RT"><i>Into</i><c>In</c></NS> this house there is a big museum, where you <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>past</i><c>history</c></NS> of Biasco.</p>
<p>Your group has been booked into <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>to take</i><c>take</c></NS> a walk</i><c>walk</c></NS> from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>To</i><c>In</c></NS> my personal opinion one of the most important and useful <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> which has been invented <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> car. Cars <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>play</c></NS> a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people <NS type="TV"><i>learn</i><c>are learning</c></NS> how to drive and <NS type="FV"><i>choose</i><c>choosing</c></NS> to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>comper</i><c>compare</c></NS></i><c>compared</c></NS> to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> a bus stop <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> cold and windy weather for a late bus, or <NS type="FV"><i>being</i><c>be</c></NS> stuck on a train for an hour due to some <NS type="DN"><i>railtrack</i><c>track</c></NS> repairs<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> can just jump into a car, tune your radio <NS type="RT"><i>onto</i><c>to</c></NS> your favourite station and have a <NS type="S"><i>plesant</i><c>pleasant</c></NS> drive to your <NS type="S"><i>distanation</i><c>destination</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Don't miss the chance to visit the <NS type="S"><i>hystorical</i><c>historical</c></NS> museum, located in the heart of the capital city. A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century<NS type="RP"><i>. The</i><c>, the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>hystorical</i><c>historical</c></NS> museum is simply a symbol, a <NS type="RN">proof</NS> of what <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>greek</i><c>Greek</c></NS></i><c>Greeks</c></NS> have always considered as <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>main</i><c>fundamental</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>principal</i><c>principle</c></NS>: their freedom. There are five <NS type="S"><i>diffrent</i><c>different</c></NS> floors, each of them presents a <NS type="S"><i>diffrent</i><c>different</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>chronical</i><c>chronological</c></NS> period of <NS type="RP"><i>greek</i><c>Greek</c></NS> history, starting from the period before the birth of <NS type="S"><i>Juisus</i><c>Jesus</c></NS> and concluding <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the revolution of 1967. The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing, famous paintings having as <NS type="MD"><c>their</c></NS> main subject the revolution of 1821, and aspects of the <NS type="RP"><i>greek</i><c>Greek</c></NS> religion that <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> always <NS type="MV"><c>been</c></NS> considered to be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> vital part of <NS type="RP"><i>greek</i><c>Greek</c></NS> history. There is a small <NS type="R"><i>amount of money that visitors should pay for entry</i><c>entry fee</c></NS>. Inside the museum there is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> bookshop <NS type="R"><i>having</i><c>with</c></NS> a large variety of <NS type="S"><i>hystorical</i><c>historical</c></NS> books, maps etc.</p>
<p>The hotel that we booked <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>is</c></NS> the Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> bus number 37<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which will go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> town <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS>. From there you will walk <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>to</c></NS> the college because it is easier to get there <NS type="M"><c>that way</c></NS> than to get <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> town <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Introduction: I am writing to <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="RV"><i>explain</i><c>describe</c></NS> you about the location, the architecture</i><c>describe the location and architecture for you</c></NS> and <NS type="MV"><c>tell</c></NS> the story of the old Roman school <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> Courtelary. I hope that you will <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>go</c></NS> there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful <NS type="AGN"><i>thing</i><c>things</c></NS> to see. It is the <NS type="RJ"><i>unique</i><c>only</c></NS> old Roman school in the world.</p>
<p>History: <NS type="MA"><i>All</i><c>It all</c></NS> began when Ogus Micius said that <NS type="AGN"><i>Roman</i><c>Romans</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>need</i><c>needed</c></NS> to go <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> school. They decided to build more <NS type="AGN"><i>school</i><c>schools</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>specially</i><c>especially</c></NS> in Switzerland because the people <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> were <NS type="DV"><i>considerated</i><c>considered</c></NS> clever. During the Second World War all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>school</i><c>schools</c></NS> were demolished <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> only <NS type="DA"><i>our</i><c>ours</c></NS> is left.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I <NS type="TV"><i>gave</i><c>have given</c></NS> you a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>reason</i><c>reasons</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> my town.</p>
<p>Firstly, I <NS type="W"><i>already have</i><c>have already</c></NS> booked <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Palace Hotel for the students. <NS type="RA"><i>There</i><c>That</c></NS> is the hotel near my college. It takes five minutes to get <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> my college <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>walking</i><c>foot</c></NS>. I will <NS type="R">copy the map around the college</NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> asking for my help <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the conference. I would like <NS type="R"><i>to help you with my best</i><c>to do my best to help you</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked <NS type="UT"><i>into</i></NS> for the <NS type="MP"><i>group</i><c>group's</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> and I spoke with the hotel manager <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>traveling</i><c>travelling</c></NS> to the conference. The hotel has <NS type="AGD"><i>their</i><c>its</c></NS> own buses, they will <NS type="RV"><i>pick</i><c>take</c></NS> us from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> hotel to the conference <NS type="RN">saloon</NS>.</p>
<p>Finally, you would like to know <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> some activities for three hours <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> free time. I think you can go to the 'Dreamland'. In this place there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> video games, some little competitions and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> small zoo available. Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the airport.</p>
<p>4. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>There</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>has</i><c>is</c></NS> no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to <NS type="FV"><i>seeing</i><c>see</c></NS> Ankara from the hill. It opens <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> 8.00 am to 5.00 pm<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car. It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total <NS type="MN"><c>number of</c></NS> members <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> your group <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> 4 and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> taxi fare would not be expensive. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel.</p>
<p>There are many sources of light in this world<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> such as sunlight, moonlight<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>candle light</i><c>candlelight</c></NS>. Some of them are natural whereas the others are not. Owing to <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> increasing demand <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> light<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for more activities, the natural source is not adequate. <NS type="SX"><i>There</i><c>Therefore</c></NS>, electric light <NS type="TV"><i>has invented</i><c>was invented</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the town centre. Students can take the airport bus <NS type="W"><i>to the hotel directly</i><c>directly to the hotel</c></NS> when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> by coach, as there are about 35 <NS type="DJ"><i>internation</i><c>international</c></NS> students, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach.</p>
<p>Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>college</i><c>college's</c></NS> main hall, <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June. There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided. Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on. Furthermore, I suggest you and the students <NS type="FV"><i>wearing</i><c>wear</c></NS> <NS type="DN">pub-wears</NS> to it, as <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> suitable for dancing.</p>
<p>Finally, on the last day, I suggest you <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS> go <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the market <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> town during the 3-hour gap. It is a nice place to buy <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>British style</i><c>British-style</c></NS> gifts <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> your family and friends. You could also enjoy the tea at the cafés nearby.</p>
<p>The location of Po Lin Temple is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos. Of course, you may <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>acquire</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>more</i><c>a greater</c></NS> knowledge <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> Hong Kong, as the temple <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> been here for nearly 100 years. <NS type="AS"><i>The <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="MP"><i>well known</i><c>well-known</c></NS></i><c>famous</c></NS> Big <NS type="S"><i>Buhha</i><c>Buddha</c></NS> you mustn't miss it</i><c>You mustn't miss the famous Big Buddha</c></NS>, or you will be sorry. The temple also <NS type="AGV"><i>provide</i><c>provides</c></NS> free Chinese <NS type="MP"><i>traditional style</i><c>traditional-style</c></NS> meals for visitors.</p>
<p>The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> from there to the conference, we have organized <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> the hotel's bus service to take the <NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> to the conference. We will meet <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the lobby at 9.00 AM.</p>
<p>The conference party will last <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>until</c></NS> 1.00 AM, but <NS type="RP"><i>every body</i><c>everybody</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>do</i><c>does</c></NS> not need to stay until the end. There will be a bus taking students who do not <NS type="RV"><i>need</i><c>want</c></NS> to stay at the party until the end. The bus will be <NS type="R">service</NS> at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> then at the end of the party <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> will be the last one. Everybody <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> free to dress for the party but <NS type="TV"><i>be considering</i><c>consider</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to be</i><c>is</c></NS> appropriate.</p>
<p>As now <NS type="TV"><i>I'm being</i><c>I'm</c></NS> away from home, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone is very important to me. Having <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> telephone I can call my mother<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> my friends<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>helping</i><c>helps</c></NS></i><c>prevents</c></NS> me from <NS type="MV"><c>feeling</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>home sick</i><c>homesick</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> not completely but I think it's better than <NS type="R">other ways</NS>. To hear the voice <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> the person you love is <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>feelling</i><c>feeling</c></NS> that <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> hard to describe<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> it's wonderful and so real<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> can imagine their face clearly.</p>
<p>I had a problem with my best friend once when we <NS type="TV"><i>keep</i><c>kept</c></NS> in <NS type="S"><i>tuch</i><c>touch</c></NS> through e-mail. The problem <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> the language<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> used English but <NS type="X"><i>we both were not</i><c>neither of us were</c></NS> very good at it <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> the time<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which made us misunderstand each other. However, the problem <NS type="TV"><i>solved</i><c>was solved</c></NS> by a telephone. We are now still <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS>. Thanks to the invention of the telephone.</p>
<p>I think that it will be nice <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the end-of-conference party if you <NS type="TV"><i>will invite</i><c>invite</c></NS> somebody to sing and give <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the <NS type="AGN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> the time to enjoy <NS type="DA"><i>theirselves</i><c>themselves</c></NS> and to dance. The party <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> will be nice. <NS type="W"><i>The clothes now</i><c>Now the clothes</c></NS> that they will wear <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> to be smart, not <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>the kind you would wear if</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> going to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> casino for example but nice casual, <NS type="R">not with</NS> sports shoes or T-shirts.</p>
<p>First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> call if you need something <NS type="SX"><i>of</i><c>or</c></NS> if <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> something <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>happend</i><c>happened</c></NS></i><c>happens</c></NS> to your house and nobody is <NS type="RT"><i>next to</i><c>with</c></NS> you.</p>
<p>Television is a good way to be informed <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> it's more relaxing.</p>
<p>First of all, the group has been booked into 'THE PALACE HOTEL'. You won't have any problem <NS type="FV"><i>to find</i><c>finding</c></NS> the college because it's <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Hotel</i><c>hotel</c></NS>, and the conference will be there.</p>
<p>First of all, I think I'm going to be busy on the 4th of April. Can we change the <NS type="RN">date</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the 5th of April, at 4 o'clock?</p>
<p>Thanks very much for letting me use your things during <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> stay. I may need to use <NS type="RY">particularly</NS> the computer and the CD player. Is that OK <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> you?</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to answer your letter where you asked for information about the <NS type="S"><i>conferents</i><c>conference</c></NS> and other points in relation <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the college <NS type="SX"><i>which</i><c>where</c></NS> the conference is <NS type="R"><i>into,</i><c>being held -</c></NS> five <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>walking</i><c>walk</c></NS>. <NS type="UV"><i>Going walking</i><c>Walking</c></NS> is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus. When you arrive <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Colleges</i><c>colleges</c></NS> there will be people indicating the way to the conference room.</p>
<p>The last <NS type="DN">relationed</NS> with computers is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>With</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> you can <NS type="S"><i>comunicate</i><c>communicate</c></NS> with people <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="IJ"><i>differents</i><c>different</c></NS> places of the world at the same moment. And you can <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>get</c></NS> lots of <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> about a lot of things. <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Every thing</i><c>Everything</c></NS> that you need you can find it</i><c>You can find everything that you need</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>.</p>
<p>You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>:</c></NS> once you <NS type="TV"><i>have gone out</i><c>go out</c></NS> of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>beside</c></NS> our college. When you are in the college<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> ask for me.</p>
<p>Apart from being <NS type="UP"><i>in-fashion</i><c>in fashion</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it?</p>
<p>After <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> conference we are planning to organise a big party with <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> barbecue. The party will take place <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> forest close to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>camping place</i><c>campsite</c></NS>. I hope we will have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> nice weather. Therefore, I suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wearing</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> casual clothes. On the <NS type="W"><i>last day <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> afternoon</i><c>afternoon of the last day</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if you have some free time<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would recommend you <NS type="FV"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> a very famous <NS type="RN"><i>exposition</i><c>exhibition</c></NS> of Leonardo Devinci. The <NS type="RN"><i>exposition</i><c>exhibition</c></NS> will take place <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> "Gribaldi museum", which you can find on <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Crariden street<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> N 5. You will never <NS type="S"><i>regred</i><c>regret</c></NS> <NS type="R">about</NS> my suggestion. If you need more information let me <NS type="S"><i>knowe</i><c>know</c></NS>.</p>
<p>report <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> the group leader</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>First</c></NS>, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you <NS type="TV"><i>going</i><c>are going</c></NS> to stay is "The Palace Hotel", <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> is situated at the <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is very near <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the conference. Also there is a bus provided <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> the organisation to take all the students <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the hotel. At the end of the conference <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> will be a party. I might suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wear</c></NS> a casual <NS type="RN"><i>dress</i><c>outfit</c></NS>, because many students <NS type="AGV"><i>feels</i><c>feel</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>like</c></NS> relaxing after <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> whole day sitting and listening <NS type="R"><i>all</i><c>at</c></NS> the conference. The party <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="RV">amazed</NS> by a group of musicians, and <NS type="UC"><i>as</i></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>remembered</i><c>remember</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>from</i></NS> last year it was <NS type="RJ"><i>unforgiven</i><c>unforgettable</c></NS>, because all the people <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> dancing and having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Firstly, about your <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, <NS type="RD"><i>our</i><c>the</c></NS> college which I belong to offers <NS type="FN"><i>visitor</i><c>visitors</c></NS> free <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>accomodations</i><c>accommodations</c></NS></i><c>accommodation</c></NS> with <NS type="R">full of</NS> facilities<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> (for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> bath, car park, free internet access, etc.)<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="R">They also are</NS> located <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> our campus so you can get to the conference by <NS type="FV"><i>walk</i><c>walking</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we <NS type="S"><i>useually</i><c>usually</c></NS> use without <NS type="UQ"><i>any</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>questione</i><c>question</c></NS></i><c>thinking</c></NS>. That's the nature of human <NS type="FN"><i>being</i><c>beings</c></NS>. But<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I think it's not only our fault but <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> evidence of how much they <NS type="TV"><i>integrate</i><c>have integrated</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>themselves</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> our life.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> the conference you should wear formal dress but you are free to choose <NS type="RD"><i>its</i><c>the</c></NS> colour or style.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference there will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>reseption</i><c>reception</c></NS> at the hotel. <NS type="RP"><i>we</i><c>We</c></NS> have arranged some tours <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the city. <NS type="RP"><i>you</i><c>You</c></NS> will be <NS type="TV"><i>visit</i><c>visiting</c></NS> some interesting places and towers.</p>
<p>Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching <NS type="RN"><i>time</i><c>experience</c></NS> that people <NS type="W"><i>get never</i><c>never get</c></NS> tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> each section of the museum.</p>
<p>In <NS type="DN"><i>replied</i><c>reply</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter, I will try to give you some <NS type="CN"><i>advices</i><c>advice</c></NS>.</p>
<p>For the conference, I suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wear</c></NS> a beautiful dress, because there will be important <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="DI"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> colleges. At the end of the conference, all students and <NS type="AGN"><i>leader</i><c>leaders</c></NS> will have a drink.</p>
<p>To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> of Poitiers which is very beautiful.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the conference.</p>
<p>What is impressive <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="UP"><i>Pompidou's</i><c>Pompidou</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS>, there are different <NS type="RN"><i>expositions</i><c>exhibitions</c></NS> on different themes. In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures. <NS type="AGD"><i>This</i><c>These</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>expositions</i><c>exhibitions</c></NS> are often very attractive and they change every year.</p>
<p>Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>over</c></NS> the city.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Concerning</c></NS> the hotel, the group has been <NS type="RV"><i>arranged</i><c>booked</c></NS> to stay in a hotel which is very near the place <NS type="MC"><c>where</c></NS> we are going to have the conference. The hotel is The Palace Hotel. <NS type="UP"><i>It'is</i><c>It is</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>just</i></NS> only 5 <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference.</p>
<p>In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no <NS type="RJ">acceptable</NS> bus <NS type="UP"><i>-</i></NS> or rail connection to go there. It <NS type="TV"><i>has been</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> hard <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me not to have the <NS type="RN">opportunities</NS> for my free time like my friends <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> lived in or near the city. I just had no <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>way</c></NS> to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go.</p>
<p>Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is situated in the city <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS>, <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> 15 <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>walking</i><c>walk</c></NS> from where the conference <NS type="AGV"><i>take</i><c>takes</c></NS> place <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College.</p>
<p>There <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough. We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the <NS type="RP"><i>river side</i><c>riverside</c></NS>, which is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> best if it is a nice day, sunny <NS type="SX"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> warm, for <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>taking</c></NS> a walk. For <NS type="UQ"><i>any</i></NS> details<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> look <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>next page map</i><c>map on the next page</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I have just received a letter from you. I <NS type="UV"><i>am</i></NS> really appreciate your <NS type="DN"><i>interesting</i><c>interest</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> our conference.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Palace hotel is your accommodation which you have booked. This is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>about</c></NS> staying there.</p>
<p>Thirdly, we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have <NS type="TV"><i>prepared</i><c>been preparing</c></NS> for 3 months. But I hope you will wear <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> formal suit and dress. You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes. Lastly, you <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>will</c></NS> not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of <NS type="AGN"><i>attraction</i><c>attractions</c></NS>. Cambridge bus tour, for example, will be very nice <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> for you because it is the best and the easiest way of <NS type="RV"><i>knowing</i><c>getting to know</c></NS> Cambridge. But if you do not like it, you can enjoy <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> City centre <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on. You will be able to buy them <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS>  reasonable price.</p>
<p>It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself. There is a wide range of facilities including theatres, game centres, Korean restaurants. In particular, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people seemed to be satisfied with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatres, because the screen is massive. The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> foreigners.</p>
<p>It <NS type="TV"><i>seemed</i><c>seems</c></NS> you can buy everything you want <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> reasonable price in the building. <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="S"><i>Especailly</i><c>Especially</c></NS></i><c>In particular</c></NS>, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap. However, you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish.</p>
<p>First of all, we come to some important points <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the organisation. The group has been booked into a <NS type="S"><i>comfortabel</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> and <NS type="MP"><i>well <NS type="S"><i>situatet</i><c>situated</c></NS></i><c>well-situated</c></NS> hotel, whose name is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>,,</i><c>"</c></NS>Palace Hotel". The hotel is on the <NS type="MP"><i>right hand</i><c>right-hand</c></NS> side of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Parker Piece, which you can find on the map<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> which I will send you. The <NS type="RP"><i>,,</i><c>"</c></NS>Palace Hotel" is 5 <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>walking</i><c>walk</c></NS> from the station. The conference is <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>situatet</i><c>situated</c></NS></i><c>taking place</c></NS> in the building opposite the bus stop.</p>
<p>You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoon. Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>that is</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>specially</i><c>special</c></NS> is our <NS type="S"><i>cathedrale</i><c>cathedral</c></NS>. The architecture <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>bring</i><c>brings</c></NS></i><c>takes</c></NS> you back <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the old <NS type="FN"><i>time</i><c>times</c></NS>. <NS type="M"></NS> as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing. We <NS type="W"><i>have also</i><c>also have</c></NS> an interesting museum and a modern theatre.</p>
<p>First of all, the TV can <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>bring</c></NS> us news in a short time, <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> what <NS type="TV"><i>happened</i><c>is happening</c></NS> all over the world. Another point in favour of <NS type="U"><i>the invention <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS></i></NS> the TV is<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that <NS type="AGA"><i>they</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>telling</i><c>tells</c></NS></i><c>shows</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> interesting reports, for instance about animals or <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> different culture <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> other <NS type="IN"><i>countrys</i><c>countries</c></NS>. Furthermore <NS type="RA"><i>they</i><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>are</c></NS> a lot of different <NS type="AGN"><i>programme</i><c>programmes</c></NS>, usually something for everybody. It <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>be also</i><c>also be</c></NS> relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work. Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can <NS type="FV"><i>watching</i><c>watch</c></NS> the weather <NS type="MN"></NS> and all of them <NS type="TV"><i>were <NS type="TV"><i>present</i><c>presented</c></NS></i><c>are presented</c></NS> in wonderful colour.</p>
<p>About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I still don't know <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> will be expected. I suggest <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wearing</c></NS> casual clothes<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I think there's no need <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> school uniforms.</p>
<p>The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of the 19th century. <NS type="AS"><i>It was an invention nobody <NS type="RV"><i>thought</i><c>realized</c></NS> how important and how widespread it</i><c>Nobody realized how important and how widespread an invention it</c></NS> would be in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very <NS type="RJ"><i>short</i><c>quick</c></NS> and direct way with the possibility <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>of getting an</c></NS> answer immediately.</p>
<p>The <NS type="FN"><i>event</i><c>events</c></NS> will <NS type="RV"><i>organize</i><c>take place</c></NS> at the Palace Hotel<NS type="RP"><i>. The</i><c>, the</c></NS> same hotel that <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="W"><i>will you</i><c>you will</c></NS> stay</i><c>you will be staying</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS>. <NS type="MD"><i>Palace</i><c>The Palace</c></NS> Hotel is opposite <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RP"><i>park</i><c>Park</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>`</i></NS>Clifton<NS type="UP"><i>'</i></NS></i><c>Clifton Park</c></NS>, which is near the college. We chose that hotel because <NS type="W"><i>is it</i><c>it is</c></NS> near the college and we don't need <NS type="UV"><i>to use</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> transport. Because you know where <NS type="W"><i>is the college</i><c>the college is</c></NS> and you need to bring <NS type="U"><i>with me</i></NS> some things <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> the college to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> hotel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is better <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>to come all the group</i><c>all the group to come</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> college and then we can <NS type="W"><i>go all</i><c>all go</c></NS> together to the <NS type="UP"><i>`</i></NS>Palace Hotel<NS type="UP"><i>'</i></NS>. The conference <NS type="AGV"><i>start</i><c>starts</c></NS> at 9:00 o'clock<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you need to be at the college half an hour before.</p>
<p>Concerning the end-of-conference <NS type="MN"><c>party</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. <NS type="R"><i>Tell me your idea</i><c>Let me know what you think</c></NS>. About the clothes that <NS type="RA"><i>we</i><c>you</c></NS> need to wear, <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> must be <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> uniform, because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the best conference <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> London and every year <NS type="TV"><i>are <NS type="W"><i>coming</i><c>come</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>lectures</i><c>lecturers</c></NS></i><c>lecturers come</c></NS> from other colleges.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Telephone</i><c>The telephone</c></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>type</i><c>means</c></NS> of communication. If you want to talk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> your friends, parents, <NS type="W"><i>partner or</i><c>or partner</c></NS> to ask something, you can call them without wondering how <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> can <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> communicate with them. <NS type="DY"><i>Especial</i><c>Especially</c></NS> if some of your relatives or friends <NS type="TV"><i>are living</i><c>live</c></NS> in <NS type="AGQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> country you can communicate with them <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS> and you don't feel that they are far <NS type="RP"><i>a way</i><c>away</c></NS> from you.</p>
<p>Today<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with the development of technology<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> been improved and the <NS type="RN"><i>abilities</i><c>capabilities</c></NS> of the telephone</i><c>the capabilities of the telephone have been improved</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>They</i><c>There</c></NS> are telephones that <NS type="W"><i>you <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>give</c></NS></i><c>give you</c></NS> the opportunity to talk with more than one <NS type="AGN"><i>people</i><c>person</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the line. Also you can leave a message if you call and can't <NS type="RV"><i>find</i><c>reach</c></NS> someone. The <NS type="RJ"><i>last</i><c>latest</c></NS> type of telephone<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is the mobile phone. You can use it everywhere and <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> anytime.</p>
<p>Finally, if I were you I would go shopping <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the City Centre <NS type="R"><i>to spend</i><c>in</c></NS> your last hours. However, if <NS type="MP"><i>you re</i><c>you're</c></NS> interested in <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="SA"><i>Archeology</i><c>Archaeology</c></NS></i><c>archaeology</c></NS> you should <NS type="S"><i>vitis</i><c>visit</c></NS> the History Museum in Garden Square.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>I</i><c>In</c></NS> the last <NS type="S"><i>fourty</i><c>forty</c></NS> years people seem to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>have become</c></NS> completely addicted <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>to</c></NS> using their <NS type="UJ"><i>own</i></NS> car. It is said that the majority of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> citizens <NS type="AGV"><i>has</i><c>have</c></NS> got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are <NS type="L"><i>getting</i><c>becoming</c></NS> more polluted.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this kind of <NS type="RN">facility</NS> has made our life more comfortable and <NS type="FJ"><i>easy</i><c>easier</c></NS>. In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and <NS type="IV"><i>carring</i><c>carrying</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>lugguage</i><c>luggage</c></NS> and shopping bags. Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long <NS type="FN"><i>journey</i><c>journeys</c></NS>. For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting <NS type="FV"><i>travelling</i><c>to travel</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>riding</i><c>on</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>hourse</i><c>horse</c></NS> but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of <NS type="DN"><i>optionals</i><c>options</c></NS> to choose <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>from</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Pusan Castle is <NS type="S"><i>locted</i><c>located</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> South of Pusan. This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan. <NS type="W"><i>There are exhibited <NS type="S"><i>historcall</i><c>historical</c></NS> things, <NS type="S"><i>picthurs</i><c>pictures</c></NS> and clothes</i><c>Historical things, pictures and clothes are exhibited there</c></NS>. It was built four <NS type="S"><i>hundread</i><c>hundred</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>years</c></NS> ago. When you go up to the top of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> castle<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you can see the whole town<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> and there <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very big <NS type="RP"><i>Park</i><c>park</c></NS> in the Castle.

So you do not need <NS type="S">pamplat</NS>, but, the entrance fee is a little expensive.

<p>Thank you for your letter. I am glad to help you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the organisation of the conference.</p>
<p>I phoned <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the tourist information <NS type="MN"><c>office</c></NS> last week and I got some information about the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the students.</p>
<p>As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the <NS type="S"><i>suitbility</i><c>suitability</c></NS> for a group of American students <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> the visit <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the Etruscan Museum.</p>
<p>2. After their visit <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the Museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the <NS type="RP"><i>tuscan</i><c>Tuscan</c></NS> Archipelago, and they could have a <NS type="UP"><i>pic-nic</i><c>picnic</c></NS> on the beach.</p>
<p>Your group has been booked <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is <NS type="RV"><i>based</i><c>located</c></NS> in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my <NS type="S"><i>oppinion</i><c>opinion</c></NS> the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>could</c></NS> take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you <NS type="W"><i>have some free time also</i><c>also have some free time</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Basicaly</i><c>Basically</c></NS>, during three <NS type="AGN"><i>hour</i><c>hours</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> interesting places <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> London. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>take</c></NS> a long walk along the river to take some essential photos.</p>
<p>As far as I <NS type="RV"><i>am</i><c>know</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UJ"><i>concerned</i></NS> the telephone was invented in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 19th century. It <NS type="TV"><i>has been affecting</i><c>affected</c></NS> our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS> very quickly, although there <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> some different <NS type="RN"><i>ways</i><c>means</c></NS> of communication <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>such as</c></NS> TV, for instance. Since the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> was introduced, many of us <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>wouldn't have imagined</i><c>couldn't have imagined</c></NS></i><c>can't imagine</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS></i><c>life</c></NS> without <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>it</c></NS>. We <NS type="TV"><i>were able even</i><c>have even been able</c></NS> to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> some time.</p>
<p>The party will be <NS type="UV"><i>take place</i></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Palace Hotel. The Hotel is very close <NS type="M"><c>to the</c></NS> Town Hall. From <NS type="RP"><i>park square</i><c>Park Square</c></NS>, just go straight. You can see the sign <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> hotel.</p>
<p>You can <NS type="RV"><i>notice</i><c>inform</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>every</i><c>all the</c></NS> students <NS type="SX"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> they <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>take</c></NS> some <NS type="S"><i>tradional</i><c>traditional</c></NS> food to the party. After <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> meal, you can play some games and prepare <NS type="RD"><i>some</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>gift</i><c>prize</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the winner. At the end of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> conference you can dance and <NS type="FV"><i>singing</i><c>sing</c></NS> together.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>There is</i><c>These are</c></NS> my <NS type="AGN"><i>suggestion</i><c>suggestions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> this party. If you still have <NS type="RD"><i>some</i><c>a</c></NS> problem, you can call me.</p>
<p>It is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> main building of LUTON University <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>park square</i><c>Park Square</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>There</i><c>It</c></NS> is <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> academic building. It <NS type="S"><i>inculds</i><c>includes</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>labrary</i><c>library</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R">II suit</NS>, <NS type="RJ">academic</NS> rooms<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> a <NS type="DN">GYM Club</NS> and a <NS type="S"><i>restuarant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS>.</p>
<p>There is a very big <NS type="S"><i>labrary</i><c>library</c></NS>. You can find any information from it <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> you want. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>For</c></NS> the rest of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> time, you can go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> IT <NS type="RN"><i>suit</i><c>suite</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>use</i><c>to use</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet. If you feel hungry, you don't need <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>to go</c></NS> out. <NS type="RY">Just</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the same building, you <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> find <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>restuarant</i><c>restaurant</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing with reference <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter concerning <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> organization of an international student conference <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Wimbledon Art College. Below I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>am clarifying</i><c>clarify</c></NS></i><c>provide</c></NS> some information you asked about.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to give you more information about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> name and location of the hotel. The group has been booked into <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> "Maria Luisa" <NS type="RP"><i>hotel</i><c>Hotel</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is situated <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village. This hotel is the next building after <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place.</p>
<p>Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>planed</i><c>planned</c></NS></i><c>meant</c></NS> to be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> Wimbledon Common - <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> nice piece of <NS type="DJ"><i>England</i><c>English</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>nature</i><c>countryside</c></NS>. So, it may be a good idea to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>wear</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>some</i></NS> very comfortable and informal clothes.</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting your group <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> our conference.</p>
<p>This building is situated on the magnificent <NS type="RN"><i>embankment</i><c>bank</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Niva River with an <NS type="S"><i>exellent</i><c>excellent</c></NS> view <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> the Hermitage Museum.</p>
<p>In the Academy of Art you can find the <NS type="IJ"><i>oldiest</i><c>oldest</c></NS> art <NS type="S"><i>libarary</i><c>library</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with a wide range of books, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> the Museum of Russian Art<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> with a huge collection of <NS type="AGN"><i>painting</i><c>paintings</c></NS>, sculpture and architectural projects from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries. It is also a good <NS type="RN"><i>chance</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to be introduced <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Russian system of art education.</p>
<p>The building of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Academy of Art in <NS type="UP"><i>St.-Petersburg</i><c>St Petersburg</c></NS> is worth visiting and interesting <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>because of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>its</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>historical</i><c>historic</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>as</i><c>and</c></NS> educational aspects.</p>
<p>About what you can do in the area <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> the free time you have, I would suggest you <NS type="TV"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> Modern Art Museum which <NS type="W"><i>has now</i><c>now has</c></NS> a new exhibition. Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> Spring Gardens<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which are beautiful <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this time of the year.</p>
<p>Think about the people living <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the time it was invented. <NS type="MA"><i>Must</i><c>It must</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>have been</c></NS> such <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles <NS type="DY"><i>for</i><c>away</c></NS>........ and now for us <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is just as simple as <NS type="FV"><i>dial</i><c>dialling</c></NS> a number and <NS type="FV"><i>talk</i><c>talking</c></NS> to whoever we want to.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the end-of-conference party<NS type="RP"><i>. We</i><c>, we</c></NS> are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> you to the Hotel<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> need to wear <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>night-dress</i><c>evening dress</c></NS> or suit and bow tie.</p>
<p>First of all, <NS type="R"><i>about</i><c>the</c></NS> BBC building is the news building of England. On the ground floor, they have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> video <NS type="FN"><i>camera</i><c>cameras</c></NS> everywhere around the building and police <NS type="AGV"><i>officer</i><c>officers</c></NS> walk around the building as well. <NS type="RT"><i>Up to</i><c>On</c></NS> the first floor, they have a huge radio room, for <NS type="FV"><i>send</i><c>sending</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>receipt</i><c>receive</c></NS></i><c>receiving</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> information <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> all over the world<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> because they have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> small BBC <NS type="FN"><i>building</i><c>buildings</c></NS> all over the world <NS type="RY"><i>either</i><c>also</c></NS>; <NS type="RP"><i>For</i><c>for</c></NS> Example, THAILAND, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> United <NS type="FN"><i>State</i><c>States</c></NS> of America, <NS type="S"><i>INDONISIA</i><c>INDONESIA</c></NS> and CANADA.</p>
<p>The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would <NS type="FV"><i>suggested</i><c>suggest</c></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>to walk</i><c>walk</c></NS> along New Street, which is the one next to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> your <NS type="MP"><i>right hand</i><c>right-hand</c></NS> side. The hotel is just opposite <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the City Hospital.</p>
<p>As you <NS type="W"><i>already possibly</i><c>possibly already</c></NS> know, the end-of-conference party will take place <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. <NS type="FV"><i>Answering</i><c>To answer</c></NS> your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all.</p>
<p>If we don't use them we suffer <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>because of</c></NS> them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and <NS type="UQ"><i>any</i></NS> other four-wheel <NS type="DJ"><i>motored</i><c>motor</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>vehicle</i><c>vehicles</c></NS>. Isn't that <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>contradictorious</i><c>contradictory</c></NS></i><c>ironic</c></NS>? To go to the countryside and <NS type="FV"><i>being</i><c>be</c></NS> able to <NS type="DV"><i>breath</i><c>breathe</c></NS> fresh, <NS type="DJ"><i>non-polluted</i><c>unpolluted</c></NS> air, I use my car, which, <NS type="ID"><i>as far as I am concerned</i><c>in my opinion</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> does not help to maintain a clean <NS type="RN"><i>air</i><c>atmosphere</c></NS> at all.</p>
<p>Therefore I am thinking <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all <NS type="AGN"><i>sort</i><c>sorts</c></NS> of fantastic places, and <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>changed</c></NS> my life for a new life: <NS type="S"><i>whithout</i><c>without</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> car.</p>
<p>I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> our college.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter. It was very <NS type="RJ"><i>sorry</i><c>sad</c></NS> news <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>about</c></NS> Richard Brown. I have given <NS type="L"><i>much</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> the international student conference.</p>

It takes about 10 minutes<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>Therefore</i></NS>, that's the <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="FJ"><i>faster</i><c>fastest</c></NS></i><c>quickest</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>means</c></NS> of transport you can choose. The Conference will start at 9 am <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> 25 June and will finish about 6 pm <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the same day. During the day <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> supposed <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>to have</c></NS> a break of half <NS type="SX"><i>and</i><c>an</c></NS> hour at 12 <NS type="R"><i>p.m<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></i><c>noon</c></NS> and finally, <NS type="M"><c>there will be</c></NS> a party for all the people who will be there. That will be a <NS type="RJ"><i>smart</i><c>formal</c></NS> party and because of this, <NS type="R"><i>it will be required a well-dressed and immaculate presence</i><c>you will be required to be smartly dressed</c></NS>. Ladies should wear an evening dress and <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>gentlman</i><c>gentleman</c></NS></i><c>gentlemen</c></NS> a dark suit.</p>
<p>And if you climb <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> the top of the main tower - the keep <NS type="MP"><c>-</c></NS> you will see <NS type="DJ"><i>unforgetable</i><c>unforgettable</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>view</i><c>views</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> a white <NS type="S"><i>toun</i><c>town</c></NS>. After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle. You will find there an amazing collection of old <NS type="AGN"><i>weapon</i><c>weapons</c></NS>, <NS type="CN"><i><NS type="S"><i>armores</i><c>armours</c></NS></i><c>armour</c></NS> and, we are especially <NS type="S"><i>pround</i><c>proud</c></NS> of it, the great collection of swords.</p>
<p>The kingdom Chosun has a history <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> 500 years and lasted until the beginning of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size.</p>
<p>As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the <NS type="W"><i>army of Japan</i><c>Japanese army</c></NS>, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who <NS type="AGV"><i>tends</i><c>tend</c></NS> to dislike <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> historical <NS type="FN"><i>visit</i><c>visits</c></NS>, would be the various <NS type="AGN"><i>activity</i><c>activities</c></NS>. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which <NS type="IV"><i>helds</i><c>are held</c></NS> daily <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the front gate of the palace.</p>
<p>I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> what you and your students can do during your free time here.</p>
<p>Some people say that many <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> important inventions in our <NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS> are not so good and useful as we have got used to <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>see</i><c>think</c></NS></i><c>thinking</c></NS> them. First of all they <NS type="RV"><i>say</i><c>talk</c></NS> about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>enviroment</i><c>environment</c></NS></i><c>environmental</c></NS> pollution which cars and other <NS type="S"><i>vechicles</i><c>vehicles</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>create</c></NS>, <NS type="R">overspending the electricity using electric equipment</NS> and some <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>problems</c></NS>. But <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> my opinion if <NS type="MP"><i>peoples</i><c>people's</c></NS> inventions <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>have</c></NS> a place in our <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS> they are <NS type="RJ">right</NS> then. I think the <NS type="S"><i>telefone</i><c>telephone</c></NS> is the most important thing in many people's <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS> as it <NS type="RV"><i>makes</i><c>allows</c></NS> you <NS type="U"><i>to be able</i></NS> to get in touch with anyone <NS type="M"><c>and it</c></NS> doesn't matter <NS type="RY"><i>wherever</i><c>where</c></NS> you are (I am talking about mobile phones<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="W"><i>now have a majority</i><c>a majority now have</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>through</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. <NS type="RD"><i>An</i><c>The</c></NS> electric lamp was an important invention <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> hundred years <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>ago</c></NS> (<NS type="R"><i>but for</i><c>at</c></NS> that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible <NS type="W"><i>to survive for us</i><c>for us to survive</c></NS> without <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>eclectric</i><c>electric</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>life</i><c>light</c></NS>. Because of shipbuilding <NS type="FN"><i>development</i><c>developments</c></NS> people <NS type="R"><i>could</i><c>were able</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>make</i><c>to make</c></NS> all <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>those</c></NS> geographical discoveries, and <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="DN">automobile transport</NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>undenyable</i><c>undeniable</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>neccecerity</i><c>necessity</c></NS> in our life.</p>
<p>I have just read your letter and I am happy to help <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> giving you some further information.</p>
<p>As you were informed, there will be a party for all <NS type="RN"><i>attendants</i><c>participants</c></NS> of the conference, which will take place afterwards <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the hotel restaurant. <NS type="RV"><i>Minding</i><c>Bearing in mind</c></NS> the fact that it will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>entirely</i><c>purely</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>sociable</i><c>social</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>meeting</i><c>occasion</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event.</p>

<p>At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech. You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice.

<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments. It was somewhat hard <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me. After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give you some advice <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> international student conference.</p>
<p>M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel. This is a <NS type="MP"><i>first class</i><c>first-class</c></NS> hotel. The easiest way <NS type="MV"><c>to get</c></NS> from the hotel to the conference is <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> bus. There is a bus stop in front of your hotel. Take the bus in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> direction <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> town. After four stops<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. <NS type="RC"><i>If</i><c>When</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>leave</i><c>get off</c></NS> the bus, the conference is in the <NS type="RN"><i>house</i><c>building</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>opposite</i><c>across</c></NS> the road. You can't miss it.</p>
<p>Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a disco. For the disco<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you <NS type="S"><i>musn't</i><c>mustn't</c></NS> wear blue jeans.</p>
<p>Finally<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> your last day<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>propose</i><c>suggest</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>to do</i><c>do</c></NS> a sightseeing tour in our town. It takes you two hours. Afterwards you will have <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>some</c></NS> time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland. If you have any more questions, <NS type="AS"><i>write me back</i><c>write back to me</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Before the time <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS> computers, people had to write <NS type="W"><i>every time a whole letter</i><c>a whole letter every time</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS>. When they <NS type="MV"><c>wanted</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>would correct</i><c>to correct</c></NS> a word, they had to write the whole letter again. With the computer<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three <NS type="AGN"><i>week</i><c>weeks</c></NS> we could send it to another person.</p>
<p>I work <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a bank and I work all day with computers. If we <NS type="S"><i>hand't</i><c>hadn't</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>ay</i><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="UQ"><i>one</i></NS>, we <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>would have</c></NS> to write all the transactions on <NS type="FN"><i>papers</i><c>paper</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to be able to help you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the international student conference.</p>
<p>The hotel <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> which the group has been booked <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> is the Palace <NS type="RP"><i>hotel</i><c>Hotel</c></NS>, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc.</p>
<p>I would be pleased to help you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> all your questions and I will provide you <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>some</i><c>the</c></NS> information which you need as <NS type="RY"><i>much</i><c>far</c></NS> as I can.</p>
<p>Imagine life without <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> phone. You are on the road, you have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> car accident. What are you going to do without <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> phone? <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the phone has saved many <NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS>. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>chating</i><c>chatting</c></NS></i><c>to chat</c></NS> <NS type="R">in any time</NS>. Thanks <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the phone, it is possible <NS type="R"><i>even your <NS type="SA"><i>mam</i><c>mum</c></NS></i><c>to speak to your mum even when she</c></NS> is <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the other end of the Earth.</p>
<p>I am writing with reference to your <NS type="RN"><i>advertisement</i><c>article</c></NS> which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> your article.</p>
<p>If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should <NS type="RV"><i>wonder</i><c>consider</c></NS> which <NS type="DN"><i>working place</i><c>workplace</c></NS> is more convenient <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you. You'd <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum <NS type="MV"><c>may</c></NS> include big tips from the tourists. Apart from <NS type="RA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS>, despite the fact that it is a summer job<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you could be employed for the whole <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> next year, if you are lucky.</p>
<p>The end-of-conference party is to be held <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness. Therefore, all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> guests will be asked to wear the <NS type="RJ"><i>corresponding</i><c>appropriate</c></NS> clothes in order to be <NS type="RV">accepted</NS>.</p>
<p>The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our <NS type="RN"><i>communication</i><c>communications</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>abilities</i><c>technology</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>throughout</i><c>over</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>those</i><c>the</c></NS> last <NS type="MQ"><c>few</c></NS> years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our <NS type="RJ"><i>ordinary</i><c>daily</c></NS> life is, of course, the mobile phone.</p>
<p>I really enjoy <NS type="RV"><i>driving</i><c>riding</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>motocycle</i><c>motorcycle</c></NS>. People say that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is dangerous<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> I don't think so. When I <NS type="RV"><i>drive</i><c>ride</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is only me and my <NS type="S"><i>motocycle</i><c>motorcycle</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>Before</i><c>In front of</c></NS> me and <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>behind</c></NS> are my friends<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> I like and trust. And around me <NS type="M"><c>is the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>nature</i><c>countryside</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> I can <NS type="RV">watch</NS> and enjoy while we <NS type="RV"><i>shop</i><c>look</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>fore</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> camp. We can go to any place we like, <NS type="FV"><i>avoid</i><c>avoiding</c></NS> traffic and <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>full</i><c>crowded</c></NS> buses<NS type="R"><i>,</i><c> and</c></NS> trains, etc.</p>
<p>I am really <NS type="S"><i>greatful</i><c>grateful</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people who invented the first <NS type="S"><i>motocycle</i><c>motorcycle</c></NS> in the world. I feel very bad about <NS type="M"><c>the fact</c></NS> that I don't know who <NS type="W"><i>was it</i><c>it was</c></NS>. On the other hand <NS type="R">no matter that I feel very good about that</NS> because that invention has changed and affected my life <NS type="SX"><i>end</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people I care about<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> has affected my life in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> very best way.</p>
<p>The end-of-conference party is designed to give <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="ID"><i>rough <NS type="AGN"><i>ideas</i><c>idea</c></NS></i><c>taste</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> many different cultures. So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world. As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>costume</i><c>national dress</c></NS> of her country. Other members of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> groups can wear <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> normal<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>pretty</i><c>attractive</c></NS> formal dress.</p>
<p>I have included <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> local map<NS type="RP"><i>, there</i><c>. There</c></NS> are some <NS type="RN">ideas</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the back of the map. Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> We have <NS type="TV"><i>arrange</i><c>arranged</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>spacial</i><c>special</c></NS> discounts for the conference <NS type="RN"><i>attendance</i><c>attendees</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Personly</i><c>Personally</c></NS> I recommend the <NS type="UP"><i>Dicken's</i><c>Dickens</c></NS> tour because it is a good length <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>walking</i><c>walk</c></NS> and very historical.</p>
<p>There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> style with escalators and <NS type="DN"><i>touched-screen</i><c>touch-screen</c></NS> ticket <NS type="FN"><i>machine</i><c>machines</c></NS>. It is also very well linked <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the old underground station<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is such a contrast in <NS type="RN">transformation</NS>. The old bit is rather unique and charming. You <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> really imagine <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> it looked like in <NS type="ID"><i>the old day</i><c>the old days</c></NS>.</p>
<p>There is another surprising section in this building. At the far <NS type="RN"><i>back</i><c>side</c></NS> of the station <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is <NS type="UY"><i>also</i></NS> connected to a spacious<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>well designed</i><c>well-designed</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="MP"><i>pedestrians</i><c>pedestrians'</c></NS></i><c>public</c></NS> park. It is a good example of <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> great architecture that was designed to provide services <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the public.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> August I am going to apply for a new job.</p>
<p>The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's <NS type="S"><i>attituds</i><c>attitudes</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> video they have to <NS type="FV"><i>be made</i><c>make</c></NS> and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. The report is based on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>opinion</i><c>opinions</c></NS> of more than 300 pupils.</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001. I hope I can give you the information you need<NS type="RP"><i>. So</i><c>, so</c></NS> the conference will be a great experience <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you and your group.</p>
<p>Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel. The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station. A free <NS type="S"><i><NS type="UP"><i>shuttel-bus</i><c>shuttel bus</c></NS></i><c>shuttle bus</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>gets</i><c>takes</c></NS> you to the <NS type="SA"><i><NS type="UP"><i>conference-center</i><c>conference center</c></NS></i><c>conference centre</c></NS>. The bus <NS type="IV"><i>leavs</i><c>leaves</c></NS> at 8 a.m. <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> the front entrance of the hotel.</p>
<p>The end-of-conference party is <NS type="UV"><i>playing</i></NS> in a <NS type="RN"><i>rent</i><c>tent</c></NS> and in the <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>greenground</i><c>green ground</c></NS></i><c>grounds</c></NS>. There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and <NS type="RA"><i>many</i><c>much</c></NS> more. It <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> a <NS type="S"><i>surprice</i><c>surprise</c></NS>! I suggest <NS type="AS"><i>to wear</i><c>that you wear</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>leisure-clothes</i><c>leisure clothes</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the party.</p>
<p>Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the bus station.</p>
<p>Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> a sightseeing tour <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> our city.</p>
<p>The museum is located in Ouchy, <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the "Delamuraz Hotel". It is close to the main road, and <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> 300 <NS type="SA"><i>meters</i><c>metres</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> the station.</p>
<p>When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. <NS type="AGA"><i>There</i><c>They</c></NS> were all <NS type="TV"><i>painting</i><c>painted</c></NS> during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the <NS type="S"><i>ceilar</i><c>cellar</c></NS>. Everything in this room is <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>connected with</c></NS> wine.</p>
<p>Last but not least I will give you some ideas <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>of</c></NS> our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>)</p>
<p>The industrial countries have encountered <NS type="RJ"><i>deep</i><c>great</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>evolution</i><c>change</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> their <NS type="RN"><i>strictures</i><c>structures</c></NS> since the car has been made available to everyone.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the last <NS type="RP"><i>Century</i><c>century</c></NS> only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>in accordance with</c></NS> this social evolution.</p>
<p>Welcome to London. You asked me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> an interesting building to visit. <NS type="ID">In my opinion</NS>, <NS type="TV"><i>I'll recommend</i><c>I recommend</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there.</p>
<p>The museum looks very old<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge <NS type="W"><i>white round</i><c>round white</c></NS> building<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library <NS type="UY"><i>before</i></NS>!</p>
<p>The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost <NS type="AGQ"><i>each</i><c>every</c></NS> one tells you a story or gives you a picture <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful <NS type="RN">lesson</NS>!</p>
<p>Firstly, the hotel which <NS type="S"><i>ha</i><c>has</c></NS> been booked for you is Palace Hotel <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is located close to the conference. In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will <NS type="RV"><i>offer</i><c>provide</c></NS>. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference. The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well. Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals. As you may <NS type="TV"><i>hear</i><c>have heard</c></NS>, our city is well known for the musicals. Or, <NS type="RP"><i>If</i><c>if</c></NS> you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> ten <NS type="MP"><i>minutes</i><c>minutes'</c></NS> distance on foot from the hotel. Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice.</p>
<p>I am very glad to help you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the International Student Conference. I hope that our friend Richard Brown doesn't have any serious <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="S"><i>willness</i><c>illness</c></NS></i><c>illnesses</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="R">Referent</NS>, where is the conference<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> This will be in the Casino Hotel and we don't need to worry <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the best way <NS type="M"><c>to get there</c></NS> because <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> all the main routes in Devonport have signs <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>that show the</c></NS> correct way to <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>this</c></NS> popular hotel.</p>
<p>After <NS type="UV"><i>finish</i></NS> the conference, there is a party in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> same hotel. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> this party<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> there <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>will be</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>;</i></NS> some <NS type="FN"><i>foods</i><c>food</c></NS>, soft drinks, music and a special place for dancing. This party is for the students so the <NS type="UN"><i>kinds of</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>clouthes</i><c>clothes</c></NS> won't be so formal.</p>
<p>On the <NS type="W"><i>day free</i><c>free day</c></NS> before <NS type="FV"><i>catch</i><c>catching</c></NS> our plane<NS type="RP"><i>. We</i><c>, we</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>chouse</i><c>choose</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>between</c></NS> two options <NS type="R">for spending</NS> our free time. One is a <NS type="DJ"><i>guide</i><c>guided</c></NS> tour <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> city</i><c>city centre</c></NS>, and another is visiting the chocolate factory.</p>
<p>Please, if you have any more <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS>, please call me <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> 38755980.</p>
<p>Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> not giving you enough information.</p>
<p>We have already booked a <NS type="DJ"><i>4 stars</i><c>4-star</c></NS> hotel - <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames. It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train. The end-of-conference party will be held in an <NS type="DJ"><i>India</i><c>Indian</c></NS> restaurant, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is next to the hotel. It is <NS type="S"><i>surposed</i><c>supposed</c></NS> to be <NS type="UV"><i>held</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>from</c></NS> 7 pm to 11 pm. Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> disco is also provided. You can wear anything you like<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> would like you <NS type="W"><i>to be just</i><c>just to be</c></NS> yourself and have fun.</p>
<p>Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> some <NS type="RN"><i>points</i><c>ways</c></NS>, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are <NS type="RY"><i>especially</i><c>specially</c></NS> made for children, such as "Learn <NS type="RP"><i>follow me</i><c>Follow Me</c></NS>" and "Be <NS type="RP"><i>good to others</i><c>Good to Others</c></NS>". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>learn</c></NS> what I should do generally or how to behave <NS type="RY"><i>nicely</i><c>well</c></NS> when I was still a child.</p>
<p>Thank you for your letter about the international student conference. Here are <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> answers <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your questions.</p>
<p>You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>opposite</c></NS> the railway station, Camberley. To get <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the conference, you catch the <NS type="W"><i>coach No.7</i><c>No.7 coach</c></NS> from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop. It takes 5 minutes from the station. When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held.</p>
<p>The end-of-conference party will be held <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium. It starts at <NS type="ID"><i>18 p.m.</i><c>6 p.m.</c></NS> and ends at <NS type="ID"><i>22 pm</i><c>10 pm</c></NS>. We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign <NS type="FN"><i>country</i><c>countries</c></NS> will prepare their ethnic foods.</p>
<p>The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is <NS type="RP"><i>worth while</i><c>worthwhile</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to see</i><c>seeing</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly <NS type="RV"><i>await</i><c>wait</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>to have</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> crawl.</p>
<p>But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers <NS type="RP"><i>back stage</i><c>backstage</c></NS>! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the <NS type="DN"><i>lightening</i><c>lighting</c></NS> area - it would help me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> my <NS type="W"><i>studies of photography</i><c>photography studies</c></NS>. What do you reckon?</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>have <NS type="S"><i>recieved</i><c>received</c></NS></i><c>received</c></NS> your letter this morning. I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to <NS type="RV"><i>attempt</i><c>attend</c></NS> the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group. I hope that <NS type="CD"><i>these</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> below <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> very useful to you, during your <NS type="RN"><i>attempt</i><c>attendance</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> conference.</p>
<p>I have booked a hotel not far <NS type="UY"><i>off</i></NS> from our school. The hotel is called <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00. There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk. You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00. You will <NS type="SX"><i>than</i><c>then</c></NS> have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage. The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to leave</i><c>leave</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> hotel by 12:00. The best way to get to the conference is to follow <NS type="UT"><i>along</i></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>collage</i><c>college</c></NS> road and turn left toward the end<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>than</i><c>then</c></NS> keep going straight<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> will eventually see the main entrance <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>collage</i><c>college</c></NS>. When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all <NS type="AGV"><i>knows</i><c>know</c></NS> where the conference is and when.</p>
<p>At the end of the conference, we will have a party. The party is to let all the students <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="MV"><c>to get</c></NS></i><c>get</c></NS> to know each other better. The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room. I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>suggust</i><c>suggest</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>them</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wear</c></NS> formal clothing, <NS type="RT"><i>as in</i><c>such as</c></NS> tie, trousers and <NS type="S"><i>blaser</i><c>blazer</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to stay</i><c>staying</c></NS> in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be <NS type="RV"><i>prepared</i><c>served</c></NS> for us. Afterwards, a live band <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> going to play <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the rest of the night. <NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic.</p>
<p>The <NS type="S"><i>Olympique</i><c>Olympic</c></NS> Museum is situated near the lake and <NS type="AGV"><i>offer</i><c>offers</c></NS>, for the tourist, an unbelievable view <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> the mountains and the lake. But also<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the museum <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> a lot of gardens with several statues. <NS type="RY"><i>Besides</i><c>Also</c></NS>, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>olympic</i><c>Olympic</c></NS> history. You can find a lot of <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>documentary</i><c>documentaries</c></NS></i><c>documents</c></NS> about it and you have several <NS type="R">competitors personal objects</NS>. In addition, you can play <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> several interactive <NS type="AGN"><i>game</i><c>games</c></NS> and learn about the rules of the <NS type="RP"><i>olympic</i><c>Olympic</c></NS> games.</p>
<p>REASONS <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>FOR</c></NS> RECOMMENDATION.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>want</c></NS> to apologise <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> you, because I <NS type="RV"><i>didn't</i><c>haven't</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>wrote</i><c>written</c></NS> to you recently, but I <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>want</c></NS> to tell you what <NS type="S"><i>hapend</i><c>happened</c></NS> to me <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> last <NS type="SX"><i>weak</i><c>week</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I had the opportunity to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> one of the most <NS type="MJ"></NS> pop <NS type="AGN"><i>concert</i><c>concerts</c></NS> in my city<NS type="RP"><i>, so</i><c>. So</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>imagen</i><c>imagine</c></NS>, I <NS type="IV"><i>fell</i><c>felt</c></NS> really really good and <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>exating</i><c>exciting</c></NS></i><c>excited</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>for that</i></NS> I don't have words <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>describe</i><c>to describe</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> but I <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> try to do it, OK?</p>
<p>They <NS type="TV"><i>need</i><c>needed</c></NS> one girl to <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> the stars of the group, so I <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>did</c></NS> it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was talking with the manager and the people <NS type="RT"><i>inside</i><c>in</c></NS> the group so I <NS type="TV"><i>meet</i><c>met</c></NS> a lot of people and <NS type="RA"><i>it's</i><c>that's</c></NS> good for my curriculum vitae <NS type="UY"><i>as well</i></NS><NS type="MP"><i> but</i><c>. But</c></NS> the best <NS type="MN"><c>it</c></NS> for <NS type="DA"><i>my</i><c>me</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>it's</i></NS> was when one of the group <NS type="CE">they with me one rose for my work am really proud about them</NS>!</p>
<p>I'm so happy to help you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> this international student conference. I'm <NS type="R"><i>afraid for</i><c>sorry to hear about</c></NS> Richard. Could you please <NS type="RV"><i>tell</i><c>give</c></NS> him my best wishes <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>his</c></NS> health? I'm sure <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> you can perfectly replace <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>him</c></NS> to lead your group.</p>
<p><NS type="RD"><i>Those</i><c>These</c></NS> days, the castle is being <NS type="RV">remade</NS>, so there is a lot of construction <NS type="RN"><i>engines</i><c>machinery</c></NS> around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>inside</c></NS> it where you can see old pictures of the castle <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>over</c></NS> the centuries. There <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> a lot of old items that were in the King's family.</p>
<p>First of all, we have already booked the <NS type="DJ"><i>Five-Stars</i><c>Five-Star</c></NS> Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very <NS type="S"><i>convenent</i><c>convenient</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>to come from</i><c>for</c></NS> the airport. You can take <NS type="RQ"><i>both</i><c>either</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>buses</i><c>bus</c></NS> or taxies. The <NS type="S"><i>nember</i><c>number</c></NS> 101 bus <NS type="RV"><i>starts</i><c>leaves</c></NS> from the airport, <NS type="SX"><i>than</i><c>then</c></NS> you can get off <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> "city college" stop. It would be a great chance <NS type="W"><i>to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>tark</i><c>take</c></NS> part in</i><c>attend</c></NS> the party for everyone</i><c>for everyone to attend the party</c></NS>. This is just a relaxing party, just <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>so</c></NS> the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better <NS type="FV"><i>to wear</i><c>wear</c></NS> a dress.</p>
<p>First of <NS type="S"><i>al</i><c>all</c></NS>, in my opinion, TV has a great <NS type="DJ"><i>education</i><c>educational</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>functions</i><c>function</c></NS>, and <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> also makes the world <NS type="UV"><i>become</i></NS> <NS type="FJ"><i>small</i><c>smaller</c></NS>. You can just sit at home <NS type="R"><i>then</i><c>and</c></NS> you can know what is happening all over the world at <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> moment. I would rather <NS type="FV"><i>watching</i><c>watch</c></NS> the news on TV <NS type="RP"><i>in stead</i><c>instead</c></NS> of reading <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>a</c></NS> newspaper or <NS type="RV"><i>hearing</i><c>listening</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> radio because the news on TV <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="RJ">vivid</NS>.</p>
<p>The group has been booked into <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> King Hotel <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> High Street<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> following the <NS type="RN"><i>rod</i><c>road</c></NS> in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>venue</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is called <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> White House.</p>
<p>Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time <NS type="FV"><i>to visit</i><c>visiting</c></NS> our town hall <NS type="R"><i>which</i><c>where</c></NS> you will be able to learn more about my area - or <NS type="M"><c>you could</c></NS> do some shopping <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> High Street.</p>
<p>But <NS type="ID"><i>in my <NS type="RN"><i>recommendation</i><c>opinion</c></NS>, I think</i><c>in my opinion</c></NS> it would be nice for the students to come and see this building<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> they will be able to learn and <NS type="AS"><i>compare with the place in their country</i><c>compare the place with their country</c></NS>. As Wales is not modern like America, <NS type="UY"><i>so</i></NS> the students will probably get <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>idea</i><c>interest</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> looking <NS type="UY"><i>back</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> old things.</p>
<p>The best way to get there<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is to take the <NS type="W"><i>bus number 7</i><c>number 7 bus</c></NS>. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will <NS type="RV"><i>leave</i><c>get off</c></NS> the bus at <NS type="RP"><i>,,</i><c>"</c></NS>Royal <NS type="RP"><i>gardens</i><c>Gardens</c></NS>". Turn left and go straight <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>along</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>,,</i><c>"</c></NS>Baker <NS type="RP"><i>street</i><c>Street</c></NS>"<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> At the <NS type="RN"><i>need</i><c>end</c></NS> of this street there is <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> house<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> number 18. This is our college.</p>
<p>You wish to know all about <NS type="UP"><i>,,</i></NS>the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will <NS type="RV">surprise</NS> us <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> their songs.</p>
<p>Finally I <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>will give</c></NS> you some <NS type="DN"><i>advise</i><c>advice</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> what you could do for about three hours.</p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Firstly<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> people are able to talk to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> person <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>every</i><c>any</c></NS> time<NS type="RP"><i>. Be</i><c>, be</c></NS> it<NS type="UP"><i>:</i></NS> just for fun or <NS type="UY"><i>also</i></NS> to discuss some important and relevant <NS type="SX"><i>thins</i><c>things</c></NS>. Moreover we <NS type="W"><i>always can</i><c>can always</c></NS> <NS type="AS"><i>call for help to the police, to the hospital or to a doctor</i><c>call the police, the hospital or a doctor for help</c></NS>. This could save <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> life!</p>
<p>The <NS type="RP"><i>Hotel</i><c>hotel</c></NS> is near the station and is <NS type="TV"><i>call</i><c>called</c></NS> "Grand Placad". When you <NS type="TV"><i>arrived</i><c>arrive</c></NS> you take the train <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> Guildford and after <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> you <NS type="W"><i>have just</i><c>just have</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="SX"><i>across</i><c>cross</c></NS></i><c>to cross</c></NS> the road<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> in front of the station.</p>
<p>In <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS> area there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting <NS type="FN"><i>building</i><c>buildings</c></NS> to visit. The best building you must see is the cathedral. It is the <NS type="FJ"><i>more important</i><c>most important</c></NS> church in <NS type="RD"><i>that</i><c>this</c></NS> area <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>because of</c></NS> its <NS type="S"><i>architeture</i><c>architecture</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>is</c></NS> built on the top of the hill and around <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> there is only a huge field. You can <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="RV"><i>arrive</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>here</i><c>there</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wolking</i><c>walking</c></NS></i><c>walk there</c></NS> because the bus <NS type="AGV"><i>stop</i><c>stops</c></NS> just <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>If you are interested <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>in</c></NS> more <NS type="IJ"><i>moderns</i><c>modern</c></NS> buildings I <NS type="UV"><i>can</i></NS> suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to visit</i><c>visit</c></NS> "Caldea"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which is a very modern <NS type="RN">bath</NS> centre with <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> beautiful architecture.</p>
<p>My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about <NS type="RP"><i>somethings</i><c>some things</c></NS> that happened <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> took place in your <NS type="S"><i>stablishment</i><c>establishment</c></NS>, The Circle <NS type="SA"><i>Theater</i><c>Theatre</c></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> made me feel very upset.</p>
<p>First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very <NS type="SX"><i>exited</i><c>excited</c></NS> to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS> the problems began. I was looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>having</i><c>getting</c></NS> a discount of <NS type="RQ"><i>some</i><c>several</c></NS> pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet <NS type="RV"><i>says</i><c>promises</c></NS>, however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>concerne</i><c>concern</c></NS></i><c>am concerned</c></NS>, the show must begin on time, but it started <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never <NS type="TV"><i>seeing</i><c>seen</c></NS> before, and the restaurant was closed with no <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>advise</i><c>advice</c></NS></i><c>notice</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, the great boom <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>massive</i><c>mass</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>comunication</i><c>communication</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> happened <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the beginning of our decade, with the <NS type="S"><i>devellopment</i><c>development</c></NS> of telephones, radio stations, television and even <NS type="S"><i>satelites</i><c>satellites</c></NS>, and of course, the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, gave <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>ordinary</c></NS> people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this <NS type="RV"><i>provided</i><c>allowed</c></NS> health and education <NS type="CN"><i>researches</i><c>research</c></NS> to increase as well.</p>
<p>It is very kind <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>do</c></NS> climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town. <NS type="ID"><i>For</i><c>As for</c></NS> sailing, well, I haven't <NS type="TV"><i>try</i><c>tried</c></NS> it before<NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> is why I want to have a <NS type="RV"><i>try</i><c>go</c></NS>. I think it must be fun.</p>
<p>I hope this letter will help you <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>organying</i><c>organizing</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the festival</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS></p>
<p>In our school we have the following rules: 1. Every <NS type="S"><i>puple</i><c>pupil</c></NS> has to sit alone<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> (I mean that one desk is given <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> one <NS type="RN"><i>man</i><c>person</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>)</p>
<p>As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction <NS type="UN"><i>literature</i></NS> as each masterpiece is unique in its own way <NS type="RT"><i>despite</i><c>regardless of</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>the fact</i></NS> what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand <NS type="W"><i>better our own life and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> people around us</i><c>our own life and the people around us better</c></NS>. However, reading an unusual, sometimes <NS type="RJ"><i>fantastic</i><c>fantastical</c></NS> story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider "Wuthering Heights" by Emily Brontë to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>everyday's</i><c>everyday</c></NS> routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the <NS type="MP"><i>world</i><c>world's</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>treasurehouse</i><c>treasure house</c></NS> of literature and arouses <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>irresistable</i><c>irresistible</c></NS> fascination.</p>
<p>I would like to travel only in July because my boss <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> give me <NS type="RQ"><i>a</i><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>leaving</i><c>leave</c></NS> for the other months <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Summer</i><c>summer</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose. To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing. I'm good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> both of these. I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like <NS type="W"><i>a lot music</i><c>music a lot</c></NS> and everybody tells me that I have a good voice.</p>
<p>The concert lasted <NS type="SX"><i>four</i><c>for</c></NS> hours and <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the <NS type="W"><i>concert <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> "Savage Garden"</i><c>Savage Garden concert</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> live and because that night was the best of my life.</p>
<p>As regards <NS type="R"><i>to the time</i><c>when</c></NS> I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only <NS type="MV"><c>travel</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I am <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> tied up <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> this time owing to <NS type="SX"><i>he</i><c>the</c></NS> exam period<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which will last until the end of June.</p>
<p>There are many activities that <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, <NS type="R">despite the artificial sunbathing</NS>. It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good choice for filming with the sophisticated <NS type="CN"><i>equipments</i><c>equipment</c></NS> that <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>owns</i><c>own</c></NS></i><c>have</c></NS>. In addition, we can film the library<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which possesses thousand of works<NS type="RP"><i>. Books</i><c>, books</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> various <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>interest</i><c>subject</c></NS></i><c>subjects</c></NS>, with up-to-date facilities such as computers<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, <NS type="FN"><i>CD</i><c>CDs</c></NS> and cassettes.</p>
<p>First, I'd like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible.</p>
<p>Second, I prefer log cabins <NS type="RT"><i>than</i><c>to</c></NS> tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents.</p>
<p>Anyway, by the time we finished everything, <NS type="S"><i>thusands</i><c>thousands</c></NS> of <NS type="SX"><i>funs</i><c>fans</c></NS> came <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert.</p>
<p>"Wuthering Heights" by Emile Brönte I think this statement is a very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>truly</i><c>true</c></NS></i><c>accurate</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>afimation</i><c>affirmation</c></NS></i><c>summary</c></NS> in the case of my book because the main character <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> others due to his complex mind and his deep<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> evil <NS type="RN"><i>manners</i><c>ways</c></NS>. <NS type="RA"><i>It's</i><c>He's</c></NS> the richest character <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> whatever happens to the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> characters. They are always suffering <NS type="MT"><c>from</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>revenge</i><c>vengeance</c></NS> that Heathcliff <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>swear</i><c>sworn to</c></NS>, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> cause of which is the miserable situation the other <NS type="FN"><i>character</i><c>characters</c></NS> have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>for</c></NS> his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this <NS type="RN"><i>trend</i><c>tendency</c></NS> to harm but <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>character</i><c>characters</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>make</i><c>have made</c></NS> him <NS type="R"><i>become thus</i><c>like that</c></NS>. This revenge links the story <NS type="MY"><c>together</c></NS> so without it we would not have such "Wuthering Heights". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important <NS type="RN"><i>point</i><c>aspect</c></NS> of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.</p>
<p>I am keen on photography so I would love to <NS type="TV"><i>participated</i><c>participate</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> this activity<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am very good at <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS> and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I <NS type="W"><i>also will</i><c>will also</c></NS> take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Like</i><c>As</c></NS> you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> last month<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>had helped</i><c>helped</c></NS></i><c>worked</c></NS> at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>Firstly</i><c>First</c></NS> I had to make the <NS type="RN"><i>decor</i><c>backdrop</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>scene</i><c>stage</c></NS>, so I made <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> some blue lights. <NS type="RP"><i>furthermore</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS> I made some stars <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>out of</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>paper in <NS type="DN"><i>argent</i><c>silver</c></NS> <NS type="SA"><i>color</i><c>colour</c></NS></i><c>silver-coloured paper</c></NS>. But that was only the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of my adventure.</p>
<p>When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, <NS type="RY"><i>differently</i><c>contrary</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> what the advertisement <NS type="UN"><i>sign</i></NS> says, <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>which</c></NS> really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.</p>
<p>So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and <NS type="MV"><c>having</c></NS> given the reasons, I expect <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> <NS type="MJ"><c>able</c></NS> to count <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> your sense of <NS type="S"><i>responsability</i><c>responsibility</c></NS>, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> spent on that terrible night.</p>
<p>So, men have invented machines to help <NS type="AGA"><i>him</i><c>them</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>his</i><c>their</c></NS> tasks, but nowadays, we <NS type="R"><i>our</i><c>are</c></NS> becoming slaves <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="R">them</NS>. The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> an early age, so that they <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> have a chance to compete with the furious <NS type="DN">emearrence</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the future.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the musical show "over the rainbow". I recently booked a week's holiday in London<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> to see the musical "over the rainbow"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the date was the 9th of June 2000<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> your firm.</p>
<p>We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>was supposed to</c></NS> start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 <NS type="RT"><i>then</i><c>before</c></NS> it started. It was also said that discounts <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>could</c></NS> she manage to keep quiet about this<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> This was the best thing that <NS type="W"><i>ever had</i><c>had ever</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>happend</i><c>happened</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> years <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the Fennall family</i><c>to  the Fennall family for yeats</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Maria was still a little bit <NS type="S"><i>chocked</i><c>shocked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>over</i><c>by</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>naus</i><c>news</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>of</i><c>that she would be</c></NS> having a baby. She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded.</p>
<p>It happened to me once<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> I wanted to go on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>, so I went to the travel agency. <NS type="RP"><i>in</i><c>In</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>front</i><c>window</c></NS> there were some good <NS type="AGN"><i>advertisement</i><c>advertisements</c></NS> about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them <NS type="S"><i>concernent</i><c>concerning</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>a holiday in</c></NS> Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, <NS type="W"><i><NS type="R"><i>but</i><c>only</c></NS> for</i><c>for only</c></NS> £250. I went inside to <NS type="FV"><i>asked</i><c>ask</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> that <NS type="RN"><i>packet</i><c>package</c></NS> but they told me that it was gone, <NS type="L"><i>therefore</i><c>so</c></NS>, I went to many <NS type="S"><i>shoops</i><c>shops</c></NS> just to <NS type="RV"><i>find</i><c>get</c></NS> the same answer. <NS type="R"><i><NS type="RP"><i>any</i><c>Any</c></NS></i><c>None</c></NS> of the <NS type="S"><i>adver.</i><c>adverts</c></NS> in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that <NS type="S"><i>adver.</i><c>advert</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> of the <NS type="MN"><c>window</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> didn't do it.</p>
<p>I WAS PART OF THE STAFF<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS <NS type="UN"><i>CARD</i></NS> AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, <NS type="RY"><i>SPECIALLY</i><c>ESPECIALLY</c></NS> BECAUSE WE WORKED <NS type="RT"><i>UNDER</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M. WITH AN <NS type="MP"><i>HOUR</i><c>HOUR'S</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>BRAKE</i><c>BREAK</c></NS> FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS THE SAME AFTER THE CONCERT.</p>
<p>I'm writing <NS type="UY"><i>back</i></NS> to answer the questions that you <NS type="TV"><i>send</i><c>sent</c></NS> me in the <NS type="RJ"><i>past</i><c>last</c></NS> letter, so <NS type="IV"><i>refering</i><c>referring</c></NS> to the question of when I would like to travel, I would like to go anytime during <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS>, because I have to be <NS type="W"><i>in <NS type="RP"><i>august</i><c>August</c></NS> back home</i><c>back home in August</c></NS>, because I need to apply and get <NS type="S"><i>everithing</i><c>everything</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>sortted</i><c>sorted</c></NS> out, to go <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> college next <NS type="RP"><i>september</i><c>September</c></NS>.</p>
<p>And <NS type="R"><i>according</i><c>referring</c></NS> to the question <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> type of accommodation I prefer, I choose a log cabin, because I think that <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent is <NS type="IJ"><i>more messy</i><c>messier</c></NS>, so I would appreciate <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if you give me <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> cabin. And my answer to the question <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> activities I would like to choose, well I choose swimming<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>cause</i><c>because</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is my daily <NS type="S"><i>excercise</i><c>exercise</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and surfing. Anyway I'm not very good <NS type="R"><i>doing</i><c>at</c></NS> surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Oh, <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> last I just would like to ask you how <NS type="CQ"><i>many</i><c>much</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>clothes</i><c>clothing</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and money I have to bring with me. And well<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Mrs Helen<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would really <NS type="S"><i>apprecciatte</i><c>appreciate</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if you <NS type="TV"><i>send</i><c>sent</c></NS> me back a letter with all the answers <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> my <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS><NS type="UY"><i>, anyway</i></NS>.</p>
<p>Well here in Dublin things <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> still the same, but I think somebody told you that I went to the <NS type="RP"><i>moby</i><c>Moby</c></NS> concert here at the <NS type="RP"><i>point</i><c>Point</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> is the big <NS type="RN"><i>theatre</i><c>venue</c></NS> for events and concerts<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard<NS type="RP"><i>, well</i><c>? Well</c></NS> he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and <NS type="S"><i>everithing</i><c>everything</c></NS> else, and when I <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>point</i><c>Point</c></NS>, do you <NS type="MV"><c>know</c></NS> who was there? <NS type="ID"><i>just imagine</i><c>Can you believe it</c></NS>, it was <NS type="RP"><i>moby</i><c>Moby</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, so</i><c>. So</c></NS> I went to say hello to him, and he <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>asked</c></NS> me<NS type="MP"><i> would you give me a hand with my decks, so</i><c>, 'Would you give me a hand with my decks?'  So</c></NS> I went, and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row<NS type="RP"><i>, oh</i><c>. Oh</c></NS> my <NS type="RP"><i>god</i><c>God</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Kim<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> that <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> the best thing that ever happened to me<NS type="RP"><i>, well</i><c>. Well</c></NS> Kim<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I hope to <NS type="S"><i>recieve</i><c>receive</c></NS> a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the <NS type="RP"><i>moby</i><c>Moby</c></NS> concert and everything, thank you.</p>
<p>This show was <NS type="W"><i>for me very disappointing</i><c>very disappointing for me</c></NS> for many reasons<NS type="RP"><i>:</i><c>.</c></NS> First of all, I was very surprised by the <NS type="DN"><i>no presence</i><c>absence</c></NS> of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to book</i><c>booking</c></NS> a <NS type="SX"><i>sit</i><c>seat</c></NS>. Also, I'm unhappy about the <NS type="RJ"><i>bad</i><c>inaccurate</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement, which clearly says<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the play begins at 19.30<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> instead of 20.15 <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> my <NS type="MP"><i>evening'</i><c>evening's</c></NS> show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons <NS type="MV"><c>being given</c></NS> and nobody <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>came</c></NS> to us to apologise or <NS type="DV"><i>advice</i><c>advise</c></NS> us <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> restaurant <NS type="DJ"><i>opened</i><c>open</c></NS> late <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> night.</p>
<p>That's why, in <NS type="RN"><i>return</i><c>response</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> all <NS type="RD"><i>those</i><c>these</c></NS> problems, I'm asking you to give back some money. I'm looking forward to <NS type="FV"><i>have</i><c>having</c></NS> an answer from you.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>with</c></NS> him and <NS type="RV"><i>let</i><c>left</c></NS> him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> his <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> that they <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> believe in him <NS type="S"><i>thrutly</i><c>thoroughly</c></NS>. For those next <NS type="MQ"><c>few</c></NS> days, Pat <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> do his best to be <NS type="R"><i>the most</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>sympathic</i><c>sympathetic</c></NS> as possible. <NS type="ID"><i>To beginning</i><c>To begin with</c></NS>, every morning Pat <NS type="TV"><i>says</i><c>said</c></NS> a pleasant "hello" <NS type="R"><i>in</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>adding</i><c>added</c></NS> to that a big <NS type="S"><i>smail</i><c>smile</c></NS>. His mother always says: "If you are <NS type="S"><i>smailing</i><c>smiling</c></NS> and are nice <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>poeple</i><c>people</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be nice and <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>smail</i><c>smile</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> you". As Pat <NS type="W"><i>does always</i><c>always does</c></NS> what his mother says his friends began to play <NS type="W"><i>again with him</i><c>with him again</c></NS>, but not just his old friends, <NS type="RP"><i>every body</i><c>everybody</c></NS> wanted to play with <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>him</c></NS>. The <NS type="RN"><i>morality</i><c>moral</c></NS> of the story <NS type="W"><i>is here</i><c>here is</c></NS> very clear: be nice <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend.</p>
<p>To <NS type="UD"><i>your</i></NS> answer <NS type="M"><c>your question</c></NS> about living in tents or cabins, I would like to sleep in a tent. A cabin <NS type="AGV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>remember</i><c>remind</c></NS></i><c>reminds</c></NS> me too much <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>of</c></NS> my home and is too <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, that</i><c>. That</c></NS> isn't what I want to have if I <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>stay</c></NS> in a wild area.</p>
<p>Yes, I have some questions <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>about</c></NS> clothes<NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>. What</c></NS> should I take with me and how much money will I need?</p>
<p>I hope<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> my ones.</p>
<p>First I arrived really early in the morning <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the place, but the people were just working and I joined them. My duty was to <NS type="DV">montage</NS> the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't <NS type="RY"><i>just</i><c>very</c></NS> easy. You <NS type="W"><i>had always</i><c>always had</c></NS> some problems <NS type="UC"><i>because</i></NS> like not having enough wire or the lamps <NS type="FV"><i>were</i><c>being</c></NS> broken by the transport. The experience that I <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>had</c></NS> was<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I had never worked in <NS type="W"><i>a such</i><c>such a</c></NS> perfect team. I was able to ask anybody, and he answered <NS type="DY"><i>detailly</i><c>in detail</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>althoug</i><c>although</c></NS> he <NS type="R"><i>was full</i><c>had a lot</c></NS> of work.</p>
<p>And <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>according to</c></NS> your advertisement, the show should <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>have started</c></NS> at 19.30 but it didn't. It was 45 minutes late! And also I couldn't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it said 'discounts available'<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I was really annoyed by that!</p>
<p>We started to go out <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the same time as I started to change my mind. I don't want to go back to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> heaven anymore as long as I am with him.</p>
<p>I am writing to reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> competition.</p>
<p>While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing, because it is my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> sport. I am good at it - I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> sailing <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>since</c></NS> childhood. The second <NS type="AGN"><i>activities</i><c>activity</c></NS> which I would like to do is surfing - I have never <NS type="TV"><i>do</i><c>done</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Thise book is about <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>men</i><c>man</c></NS> who <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS> that he will die soon, he <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS> that he didn't <NS type="FV"><i>made</i><c>make</c></NS> his dream <NS type="S"><i>coom</i><c>come</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>tru</i><c>true</c></NS>. So he <NS type="S"><i>decidet</i><c>decided</c></NS> to go for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> last trip in his life. <NS type="DD"><i>Hes</i><c>His</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>destenation</i><c>destination</c></NS></i><c>goal</c></NS> is <NS type="FV"><i>get</i><c>to get</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Marlin. He is very old, and he isn't so strong <NS type="RT"><i>that</i><c>as</c></NS> he should be. He <NS type="AGV"><i>need</i><c>needs</c></NS> to rest, but he <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>geve</i><c>give</c></NS> up. <NS type="SX"><i>I</i><c>In</c></NS> the end he <NS type="AGV"><i>make</i><c>makes</c></NS> his <NS type="S"><i>drems</i><c>dreams</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>coom</i><c>come</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>tru</i><c>true</c></NS>, he <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>get</i><c>gets</c></NS></i><c>catches</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> vast Marlin.</p>
<p>In answer <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> your letter<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I would like to travel in July for two <NS type="AGN"><i>reason</i><c>reasons</c></NS><NS type="MP"><i> one's</i><c>.

<p>I think in the <NS type="DJ"><i>nearly</i><c>near</c></NS> future we need to decide with the <NS type="S"><i>goverment</i><c>government</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> which <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> special place in the town <NS type="UA"><i>we</i></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>lefet</i><c>left</c></NS> just <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>comerical</i><c>commercial</c></NS> area, but of course with all the facilities to get there<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like a big supermarket<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> and mall centre<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> different areas of the city.</p>
<p>But the play started <NS type="S"><i>fourty-five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan <NS type="R">an</NS> who was the <NS type="DJ"><i>mainly</i><c>main</c></NS> reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> why I decided to see the play, <NS type="TV"><i>was changed</i><c>had been changed</c></NS> for another actor, <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>who</c></NS> turned out to be really bad.</p>
<p>I think that some of the changes <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> been very good, like the <NS type="S"><i>impruvement</i><c>improvement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> medical science, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> now can <NS type="FV"><i>saved</i><c>save</c></NS> millions of <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS> that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.</p>
<p><NS type="MT"><i>The</i><c>Concerning the</c></NS> activities that you have listed <NS type="UN"><i>forms</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>. Some</i><c>, some</c></NS> of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> them I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> really interested in <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>, especially painting. Since I was young, my dad <NS type="UA"><i>he</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>alway</i><c>always</c></NS> took</i><c>has always taken</c></NS> me <NS type="R"><i>out to have</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>live</i><c>life</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>drawings</i><c>drawing</c></NS>, so now it <NS type="TV"><i>became</i><c>has become</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>one of</c></NS> my hobbies. And I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> nice to draw <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> beautiful landscapes of the place. Beside <NS type="FN"><i>drawings</i><c>drawing</c></NS>, swimming is my favourite as well. When I was in <NS type="RP"><i>highschool</i><c>high school</c></NS>, I <NS type="TV"><i>have joined</i><c>joined</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the swimming club. And I also participated in a few swimming <NS type="AGN"><i>competition</i><c>competitions</c></NS>. Although I'm not the best, <NS type="UC"><i>but</i></NS> I have a lot of <NS type="DN"><i>confident</i><c>confidence</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. <NS type="UT"><i>For most</i><c>Most</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>of the</i></NS> people might think, why would I say that<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>?</c></NS> because shopping is a very good entertainment<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially for <NS type="L"><i><NS type="FN"><i>female</i><c>females</c></NS></i><c>women</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>- Activities: <NS type="RP"><i>During</i><c>during</c></NS> my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. <NS type="ID"><i>On the other side</i><c>On the other hand</c></NS> I have no experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> surfing<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation.</p>
<p>In this <NS type="RN"><i>contest</i><c>context</c></NS>, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> it as a duty. But if you realize how important <NS type="UT"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>is for your health what you buy</i><c>what you buy is for your health</c></NS> you will go shopping with <NS type="R"><i>much more</i><c>a far greater</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>consiousness</i><c>consciousness</c></NS> and <NS type="MQ"><c>more</c></NS> joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your <NS type="RN"><i>behaviour of</i><c>approach to</c></NS> shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> and use e-business and <NS type="RP"><i>online-shopping</i><c>online shopping</c></NS> to order your pants for example.</p>
<p>This is even <NS type="RJ"><i>an appropriate</i><c>a good</c></NS> way to get around <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>before</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>have ordered</i><c>order</c></NS> them by e-mail! Another <NS type="RN"><i>solution</i><c>way</c></NS> to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.</p>
<p>You have been presented <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> some <NS type="RN"><i>causes</i><c>reasons</c></NS> why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of <NS type="R"><i>behaviour to make more fun of it</i><c>making it more fun</c></NS>. It depends on every individual to change your mind and <NS type="RV"><i>act</i><c>behave</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> a 'smart' shopper.</p>
<p>Recently I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> interested in musical shows, because I have never seen <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS> in my country. When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me. So I went to London to see the show.</p>
<p><NS type="R">I would like to see the change in an advantage and a disadvantage view,</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>As</c></NS> an advantage<NS type="RP"><i>. The</i><c>, the</c></NS> modern technology is developing toward convenience for <NS type="FN"><i>human</i><c>humans</c></NS>.</p>
<p>So, <NS type="RA"><i>we</i><c>you</c></NS> can <NS type="RV"><i>be connected</i><c>contact</c></NS> other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>other <NS type="S"><i>contry</i><c>country</c></NS> people</i><c>people in other countries</c></NS> in real time by using <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. How <NS type="S"><i>incredable</i><c>incredible</c></NS> it is!</p>
<p>I hope I'll be able to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July<NS type="RP"><i>. Due</i><c>, due</c></NS> to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July. I prefer to stay in log cabins , <NS type="RC"><i>therefore</i><c>because</c></NS> I'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog. I wonder if I can take them as well. Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing. I love swimming and also I've got a <NS type="S"><i>scubar</i><c>scuba</c></NS> diving licence. I used to enjoy <NS type="S"><i>floting</i><c>floating</c></NS> on the water whenever I was on holiday. Singing is the most <NS type="S"><i>favarite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> hobby for us. We often go out to sing in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Karaoke bar.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: "Over the rainbow". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> one of the stars, instead there was <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>for</c></NS> my embarrassing story <NS type="RV"><i>was</i><c>to get</c></NS> out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so <NS type="S"><i>stupied</i><c>stupid</c></NS>, telling her my secret after all I <NS type="MV"><c>had</c></NS> been going through to keep it to myself. But now <NS type="UY"><i>when</i></NS> the story was out, <NS type="R"><i>it was</i><c>I</c></NS> just <NS type="TV"><i>to start</i><c>started</c></NS> to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>worring</i><c>worrying</c></NS> about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my face. I <NS type="S"><i>decieded</i><c>decided</c></NS> to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a <NS type="S"><i>lession</i><c>lesson</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At first</i><c>Firstly</c></NS>, <NS type="DA"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it had different <NS type="DN"><i>actor</i><c>actors</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>disappointely</i><c>to my disappointment</c></NS>. Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>deleyed</i><c>delayed</c></NS></i><c>was delayed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>until</c></NS> 20:15. I had to wait 45 minutes, wasting time.</p>
<p>Thirdly, tickets were £10, £15 and £20, and I knew that these were available <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> discount, following the advertisement. But it was impossible.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>In</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>hopeness</i><c>hope</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> you understand me.</p>
<p>It was a very <NS type="S"><i>unpleasent</i><c>unpleasant</c></NS> evening. First of all, it had <NS type="RV"><i>read</i><c>said</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> this show. But someone else <NS type="RV"><i>participated</i><c>performed</c></NS> instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing.</p>
<p>My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The <NS type="RN"><i>timer</i><c>alarm</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> my radio wakes me up at half past six.</p>
<p>After <NS type="S"><i>breakfeast</i><c>breakfast</c></NS> I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always <NS type="RV"><i>reach</i><c>arrive</c></NS> late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to <NS type="R">make compositions</NS>, to print some pictures or to surf <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends <NS type="RT"><i>per</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone.</p>
<p>I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL <NS type="UN"><i>SHOW</i></NS> THAT IS TAKING <NS type="RN"><i>PART</i><c>PLACE</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>AT</c></NS> THE CIRCLE THEATRE. I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>FOR</c></NS> THE <NS type="RN"><i>PLAY</i><c>MUSICAL</c></NS> IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY.</p>
<p>THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ <NS type="R"><i>THE</i><c>WHO WAS</c></NS> STARRING. IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'. BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT <NS type="RA"><i>THERE</i><c>IT</c></NS> WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT. I THOUGHT IT <NS type="TV"><i>WILL</i><c>WOULD</c></NS> BE AT 19.30 AND I <NS type="TV"><i>HAVE BEEN WAITING</i><c>WAITED</c></NS> FOR <NS type="MP"><i>FORTY FIVE</i><c>FORTY-FIVE</c></NS> MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT <NS type="RV"><i>VISIT</i><c>GO TO</c></NS> THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN <NS type="S"><i>ADITION</i><c>ADDITION</c></NS> TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> MY TICKET. SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A <NS type="DJ"><i>COMPLETELY</i><c>COMPLETE</c></NS> DISASTER.</p>
<p>NOWADAYS, PEOPLE <NS type="W"><i>SEEM TO BE ALWAYS</i><c>ALWAYS SEEM TO BE</c></NS> WORRIED. ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> WHAT <NS type="UV"><i>ARE</i></NS> THEY <NS type="TV"><i>LOOKING</i><c>LOOK</c></NS> LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY <NS type="RT"><i>IN</i><c>ON</c></NS> CLOTHES.</p>
<p>It was a strange experience because <NS type="MP"><i>its</i><c>it's</c></NS> something new <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!!</p>
<p>If I have to find <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>timetables</i><c>timetable</c></NS>, it is very useful to have the <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to see <NS type="MA"><c>them</c></NS> on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. But after a while you gain experience and you <NS type="W"><i>get soon</i><c>soon get</c></NS> used to this kind of research.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>As</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>is</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>explain</i><c>explained</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back <NS type="R"><i>because of</i><c>for</c></NS> the reasons that I mentioned <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>above</c></NS>.</p>
<p>After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not <NS type="RJ"><i>available</i><c>able</c></NS> to go to school. <NS type="RQ"><i>Some</i><c>All</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>her</c></NS> friends phoned her <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved<NS type="RP"><i>, despite</i><c>. Despite</c></NS> that, she was not sad. One day, when Maria was <NS type="RV"><i>seating</i><c>sitting</c></NS> in her bedroom, someone <NS type="TV"><i>knock</i><c>knocked</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> the door<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was Manuel<NS type="RP"><i>, he</i><c>. He</c></NS> was worried <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> her. Maria was nervous, but<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for the first time, she could talk to him as she never <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>had</c></NS> before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the world<NS type="RP"><i>, she</i><c>. She</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>gave</i><c>had</c></NS> her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> after all, everything happened because of her.</p>
<p>About the <NS type="S"><i>acommodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>out of</i><c>from</c></NS> the two <NS type="RN"><i>possibilities</i><c>options</c></NS>, I choose <NS type="FV"><i>sleeping</i><c>to sleep</c></NS> in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.</p>
<p>Do you remember that I had to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers<NS type="RP"><i>, did</i><c>. Did</c></NS> you know I'm one of them?</p>
<p>There I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>was</c></NS> impressed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> how a singer can cause such <NS type="S"><i>histerism</i><c>hysteria</c></NS> in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> teenagers. During the <NS type="R"><i>two hours of</i><c>two-hour</c></NS> concert we had to attend <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> thirty-six people<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> who became <NS type="DJ"><i>inconscious</i><c>unconscious</c></NS> after being trapped in the first <NS type="RN"><i>line</i><c>row</c></NS> by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert <NS type="R"><i>and you can avoid it. Do it!</i><c>avoid it if you can.</c></NS> It's the best thing you can do <NS type="ID">in this case</NS>.</p>
<p>First of all you asked when <NS type="W"><i>would I</i><c>I would</c></NS> be able to travel. You ought to know that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is possible <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> August.</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to contact me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> any more <NS type="FN"><i>question</i><c>questions</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, <NS type="X"><i>no</i><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>having</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> size for you or too high prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to "The Circle Theatre" to see the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW". I'm very disappointed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> this evening. The first thing was<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that it started 45 minutes late. And when it <NS type="DY"><i>finaly</i><c>finally</c></NS> started, <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> wasn't Danny Brook who <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>plaied</i><c>played</c></NS></i><c>performed</c></NS>. There was a different actor and he was really bad. You should have informed us before that <NS type="TV"><i>you've</i><c>you'd</c></NS> changed the actor. On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't. After the show I wanted to drink <NS type="S"><i>somthing</i><c>something</c></NS> in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>too</c></NS> late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday. So I ask you <NS type="S"><i>sincearly</i><c>sincerely</c></NS> for my money back <NS type="S"><i>becaus</i><c>because</c></NS> it wasn't a perfect evening out.</p>
<p>However, there are <NS type="SX"><i>may</i><c>many</c></NS> other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London. For example, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the time of our visit there is going to be "The London Fashion and Leisure Show". It is a <NS type="S"><i>coinsidence</i><c>coincidence</c></NS> which we would be extremely happy to take advantage <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS>. This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have <NS type="S"><i>authograps</i><c>autographs</c></NS> from.</p>
<p>Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and <NS type="RT"><i>beside</i><c>aside from</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the fact</c></NS> that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition, and I am glad <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> it. I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to give the information you asked me <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> and also I would like to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>required</i><c>require</c></NS></i><c>request</c></NS> some information about the prize.</p>
<p>First of all I <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>want to</c></NS> let you know I could travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because it is the <NS type="RN"><i>time</i><c>month</c></NS> that I have holidays from my school. Furthermore I would like to choose <NS type="R"><i>for accomodation</i><c>to stay</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> instead of <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>cabins</i><c>cabin</c></NS> because I think <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> could be more exciting and <NS type="MV"><c>could provide</c></NS> more contact with the <NS type="S"><i>enveiroment</i><c>environment</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Kim: I am sorry, I haven't written <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="FY"><i>soon</i><c>sooner</c></NS> but I <NS type="MV"><c>am</c></NS> still excited <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the experience I had helping Will Smith on the freeway <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> last month. Anyway<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> now I am going to tell you everything about it.</p>
<p>As you know<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents' house, but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car. It was a Jaguar with Will Smith <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said<NS type="RP"><i> "of</i><c>, "Of</c></NS> course".</p>
<p>He had a puncture <NS type="UN"><i>wheel</i></NS> and he didn't know how to <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>repeared</i><c>repaired</c></NS></i><c>repair</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS><NS type="MP"><i> then</i><c>. Then</c></NS> I <NS type="SX"><i>chanced</i><c>changed</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>wheel</i><c>tyre</c></NS> and during this time he was asking me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> my hobbies, studies, everything. He was really kind and friendly but really what I really <NS type="W"><i>most enjoyed</i><c>enjoyed most</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> it<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was when he invited me <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> night for a drink <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the most <NS type="RJ"><i>luxury</i><c>luxurious</c></NS> pub I have ever been <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS>. <NS type="TV"><i>Could</i><c>Can</c></NS> you believe my luck?</p>
<p>My name is ... Two weeks ago my family and I visited London. During our stay we saw a <NS type="RJ">bright</NS> advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> your theatre and decided to see this <NS type="RJ"><i>newest</i><c>latest</c></NS> and best musical show (as it <NS type="TV"><i>was said</i><c>said</c></NS> in <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> advertisement). Actually<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> I must say that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>our perfect evening wasn't</i><c>wasn't our perfect evening</c></NS> out!</p>
<p>They ignored me. We bought tickets without <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount. I don't know <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>whether</c></NS> they <NS type="MV"><c>offered</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> discount <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> somebody else or not.</p>
<p>I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I <NS type="TV"><i>was saving</i><c>saved</c></NS> my pocket money to go to the theatre <NS type="M"></NS> age <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> 15. During <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>those</c></NS> years I had met <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning <NS type="RC"><i>while</i><c>when</c></NS> I was going to school. Despite <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="M"><c>the fact that</c></NS> going to school by bus <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> easier than <NS type="RV"><i>riding</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>bycyle</i><c>bicycle</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I had <NS type="IV"><i>prefered</i><c>preferred</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> going to school by <NS type="S"><i>bycyle</i><c>bicycle</c></NS> to <NS type="MV"><c>going</c></NS> by bus. In that way I <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>was</c></NS> able to see her every morning. The more <NS type="W"><i><NS type="TV"><i>seeing</i><c>saw</c></NS> her I <NS type="UV"><i>could</i></NS></i><c>I saw her</c></NS>, the more <NS type="RJ"><i>ambitious</i><c>determined</c></NS> I became. At last I met <NS type="UT"><i><NS type="SX"><i>wit</i><c>with</c></NS></i></NS> her. She <NS type="TV"><i>had invited</i><c>invited</c></NS> me <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> her play <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the theatre. When I went <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>her play to see</i><c>to see her play</c></NS>, I <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>realy</i><c>really</c></NS> would love to be <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> actress. She was the only person who <NS type="TV"><i>encourage</i><c>encouraged</c></NS> me to be <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> actress.</p>
<p>I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July. The reason is that I am a full-time student <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> semester, which is in June. I hope that it is not a problem.</p>
<p>From the list of all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> activities I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> photography and golf. Since secondary school I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> very interested in taking pictures and I have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>broad</c></NS> experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> it. I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> golf because I have never played <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> this game.</p>
<p>Please, send me any information <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> what <NS type="W"><i>should I</i><c>I should</c></NS> take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>My friend offered me a job as a member of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>techical</i><c>technical</c></NS> staff <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew.</p>
<p>I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. <NS type="ID"><i>At first</i><c>First of all</c></NS> - we have to be <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> time. Our lessons start at 8 <NS type="UP"><i>a.m</i><c>am</c></NS> and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>studenst</i><c>students</c></NS> wear jeans and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>sweaters</i><c>sweater</c></NS>. We have to be quiet during <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our <NS type="UP"><i>school-bags</i><c>school bags</c></NS> are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. <NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>This</c></NS> is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> good marks at school they let us <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>go</c></NS> out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>neccessary</i><c>necessary</c></NS></i><c>compulsory</c></NS>. We aren't allowed to smoke <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> drink any alcohol.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>went</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> your annual international art festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. So, I <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>am writing</c></NS> some of my <NS type="S"><i>opionions</i><c>opinions</c></NS> and suggestions to you</i><c>am writing to you with some of my opinions and suggestions</c></NS>. I hope <NS type="UV"><i>it's</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>may</i><c>might</c></NS> help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> next year's festival.</p>
<p><NS type="FV"><i>Look</i><c>Looking</c></NS> forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> next year's festival.</p>
<p>One day, a little <NS type="AGN"><i>girls</i><c>girl</c></NS> called Sara<NS type="U"><i>. She</i></NS> was walking over a bridge. Suddenly, she <NS type="IV"><i>heart</i><c>heard</c></NS> a <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>men</i><c>man</c></NS></i><c>man's</c></NS> voice <NS type="FV"><i>called</i><c>calling</c></NS> her<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> "Sara...Sara.. look down to the river." Then Sara looked <NS type="RT"><i>down</i><c>into</c></NS> the river. She was very scared<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> she saw a golden fish <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> was smiling at her and talking to her. After a few <NS type="AGN"><i>second</i><c>seconds</c></NS>, Sara felt that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> golden fish was lovely. She <NS type="TV"><i>never seen</i><c>had never seen</c></NS> any fish <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> had that wonderful colour and <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> talk with her. Because Sara <NS type="RV"><i>hasn't got</i><c>didn't have</c></NS> any <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>bother</i><c>brother</c></NS></i><c>brothers</c></NS> and <NS type="FN"><i>sister</i><c>sisters</c></NS>, and her <NS type="S"><i>Mon</i><c>Mom</c></NS> and Dad <NS type="TV"><i>need</i><c>needed</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>to work</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS>, <NS type="UY"><i>so</i></NS> she was very lonely.</p>
<p>Therefore, she came <NS type="M"><c>to the</c></NS> river <NS type="RP"><i>everyday</i><c>every day</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i>talk</i><c>talked</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> everything <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the golden fish. They were very close <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS>. After half <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> year, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> golden fish suddenly <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>disappear</i><c>disappears</c></NS></i><c>disappeared</c></NS>. Sara was very sad. She sat and <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>cry</i><c>cries</c></NS></i><c>cried</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> the river. Then somebody called her name<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> "Sara... Sara..<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> look at me..<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I'm <NS type="FV"><i>stand</i><c>standing</c></NS> on your <NS type="MP"><i>left hand</i><c>left-hand</c></NS> side.<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> Sara remembered the <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> golden fish. <NS type="RA"><i>She</i><c>It</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>suddenly <NS type="AGV"><i>become</i><c>becomes</c></NS></i><c>had suddenly become</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> human, a little boy. After a few <NS type="AGN"><i>day</i><c>days</c></NS> they got married. <NS type="AS"><i>Both together had their wonderful life</i><c>They had a wonderful life together</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> International Arts Festival<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I went to recently. I had a great time there because <NS type="R">taking a place the kind of festival in my town</NS> is very unusual. I think that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the weekend due to my <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>working</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="FN"><i>weekday</i><c>weekdays</c></NS> <NS type="R">so that</NS> I had time to go and did not have to <NS type="RV"><i>care</i><c>worry</c></NS> about the ticket price.</p>
<p>First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I have to work all year except one <NS type="MP"><i>month</i><c>month's</c></NS> holiday <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July.</p>
<p>I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in <NS type="RV"><i>going</i><c>spending</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent.</p>
<p>I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for <NS type="R">speed sensations</NS>. I am good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend.</p>
<p>Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous. However, I was disappointed by the number of <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>them</c></NS>. It <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be great if there were <NS type="UV"><i>would have</i></NS> more choice <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> next year. I would like to give you a suggestion about the <NS type="RN"><i>space</i><c>size</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the concert rooms. Considering the <NS type="DN"><i>crowded</i><c>crowd</c></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> should <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>be</c></NS> more rooms. Finally, I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be interested in <NS type="FV"><i>meet</i><c>meeting</c></NS> artists from everywhere in the world not only <NS type="S"><i>Europeen</i><c>European</c></NS> artists.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I'm very happy to receive some news <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>from</c></NS> you. I'm going to reply <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> your question.</p>
<p>What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, <NS type="RY"><i>then</i><c>so</c></NS> I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> my Mum or Dad <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> going <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> my friend after <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>lessons</i><c>school</c></NS>. They wanted <NS type="R"><i>that I</i><c>me</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>did</i><c>to do</c></NS> my homework before <NS type="M"><c>going out</c></NS> to play. Also, I had to come back <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> home on time<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was very important for my parents. I <NS type="X"><i>want to change nothing</i><c>didn't want to change anything</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was happy.</p>
<p>"Over The Rainbow" <NS type="TV"><i>was looking</i><c>looked</c></NS> very interesting <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement but <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> organisation and <NS type="RN"><i>play</i><c>show</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> almost terrible.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Out</i><c>At</c></NS> the end<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> your theatre restaurant was closed <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> unknown reasons, but <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>an</i><c>the</c></NS> advertisement <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was clearly <NS type="RV"><i>sign</i><c>stated</c></NS>:</p>
<p>Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better. Often people do not see how it <NS type="RV"><i>effects</i><c>affects</c></NS> our <NS type="RP"><i>life style</i><c>lifestyle</c></NS>. Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers, <NS type="UN"><i>Hi-Fi</i></NS> stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day. They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant. Transport and communication <NS type="W"><i>without cars, trains, planes and telephones <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> not exist</i><c>would not exist without cars, trains, planes and telephones</c></NS>. We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors. Without these, and newspapers of course<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> knowing our world could be hard. <NS type="ID"><i>On the second hand</i><c>On the other hand</c></NS> people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers. <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the end</i><c>Finally</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we must mention modern medicine. It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases.</p>
<p>I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>have</c></NS> some <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> about the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the show.</p>
<p>I thank you for <NS type="FV"><i>read</i><c>reading</c></NS> my letter<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I hope you write <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> me back</i><c>back to me</c></NS>, and don't forget my money!</p>
<p>I'm surprised to read that I've won the first prize. So I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I've <NS type="W"><i>got only</i><c>only got</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RY"><i>there</i><c>then</c></NS> free time</i><c>free time then</c></NS>. I've got a lot of work and my boss <NS type="TV"><i>didn't allowed</i><c>won't allow</c></NS> me to leave my <NS type="RN"><i>job</i><c>work</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> any other time.</p>
<p>I am writing this as a reply <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> request to provide you with some information about my <NS type="IN"><i>preferencies</i><c>preferences</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I <NS type="TV"><i>am really enjoying</i><c>really enjoy</c></NS> swimming. We live near the <NS type="RP"><i>sea shore</i><c>seashore</c></NS> and swimming is the <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> I am really good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS>. <NS type="M"><i>Far</i><c>I am by far</c></NS> the best swimmer in my school. The other subject is photography. I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more <NS type="SX"><i>then</i><c>than</c></NS> just good.</p>
<p>Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be <NS type="FJ"><i>better</i><c>best</c></NS> to take with me, what <NS type="W"><i>I'll</i><c>will I</c></NS> need at Camp? How much money should I take<NS type="RP"><i>, will</i><c>? Will</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> be any guided tours? And how many will be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Camp in July?</p>
<p>People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get <NS type="RJ"><i>tied</i><c>tired</c></NS>. People <NS type="TV"><i>are not smiling</i><c>do not smile</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> each other, <NS type="TV"><i>not talking</i><c>do not talk</c></NS> to each other at the shops. They look like <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>robotes</i><c>robots</c></NS> who have to do their <NS type="FN"><i>duties</i><c>duty</c></NS> - to buy.</p>
<p>And if there was musical event<NS type="RP"><i>. It</i><c>, it</c></NS> would be <NS type="DJ"><i>greatful</i><c>great</c></NS>. I hope the next one will be better. And I would like to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>making</i><c>organising</c></NS> this festival.</p>
<p>Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually<NS type="RP"><i>. We</i><c>, we</c></NS> have quite strict rules. When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes. <NS type="CE">Only It was like a formal clothes.</NS> And we couldn't wear any <NS type="SA"><i>colorful</i><c>colourful</c></NS> clothes and socks. Also our <NS type="RP"><i>hair style</i><c>hairstyle</c></NS> was the same <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>for</c></NS> everyone. It's really strict.</p>
<p>The most difficult work was to arrange <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> coach trip to the concert hall as there were many <NS type="RN"><i>audience</i><c>people</c></NS> from <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> this experience? <NS type="TV"><i>I've found</i><c>I found</c></NS> pop music so wonderful, it changed my <NS type="RN"><i>idea</i><c>opinion</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> that <NS type="RJ"><i>classic</i><c>classical</c></NS> music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.</p>
<p>Two sisters, Alex and Daniela<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>a</c></NS> present for their mother. <NS type="RV"><i>Offering</i><c>Giving</c></NS> Christmas presents was a tradition not <NS type="FV"><i>be</i><c>to be</c></NS> forgotten and <NS type="M"><c>there were</c></NS> only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister.</p>
<p>After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold. <NS type="UT"><i>In deep</i><c>Deep</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>within</c></NS> herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the prize <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> camp California in America.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the time that I would like to travel<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> must be <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July only. This is because my <NS type="FN"><i>A-levels</i><c>A-level</c></NS> exams <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> coming up so I really need <NS type="FN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS> to revise, and July is the only <NS type="CL"><i>month and time</i><c>month</c></NS> that I am free.</p>
<p>It was <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> enjoyable time in my life and <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> wished that you were there with me. <NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>Through</c></NS> this letter, I am sure that you <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>will</c></NS> be able to share this experience with me.</p>
<p>For me the most disappointing problem was that the <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook.</p>
<p>I was impressed <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different <NS type="FN"><i>culture</i><c>cultures</c></NS> and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> student too.</p>
<p>I'd like to suggest this - <NS type="RT"><i>concerned with</i><c>concerning</c></NS> plays and films. Plays and films <NS type="UN"><i>qualities</i></NS> were good, <NS type="R"><i>but quantities were bad</i><c>there weren't enough</c></NS>. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival.</p>
<p>Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far <NS type="FY"><i>much</i><c>more</c></NS> than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my <NS type="S"><i>concerntration</i><c>concentration</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>study</i><c>studies</c></NS> and I spent the money <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.</p>
<p>In addition to this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there <NS type="SX"><i>fro</i><c>for</c></NS> the occasion and, personally speaking<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>I think</c></NS> the show could be done <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the open air next year, so that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.</p>
<p>Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the Festival.</p>
<p>I <NS type="W"><i>also would</i><c>would also</c></NS> like to know how much money I will get from you for <NS type="RA"><i>those</i><c>these</c></NS> two weeks because I would like to spend some money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> clothes.</p>
<p>It was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> hard but also <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS> work. You should try to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>called</i><c>call</c></NS></i><c>get</c></NS> some experience <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> such a concert<NS type="RP"><i> you</i><c>.  You</c></NS> would not regret it.</p>
<p>I am a <NS type="RP"><i>nineteen year old</i><c>nineteen-year-old</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>gild</i><c>girl</c></NS> who is still attending classes at Saint John's School. For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> painting.</p>
<p>I would appreciate <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if I could travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because my school gives me two <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RN"><i>winter</i><c>summer</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>holiday's</i><c>holiday</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>week</i><c>weeks</c></NS></i><c>weeks'</c></NS></i><c>weeks' summer holiday</c></NS>. As far as accommodation is <NS type="DJ"><i>concern</i><c>concerned</c></NS>, I prefer staying in a <NS type="SX"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabin. I believe it is better than a tent because <NS type="R"><i>this one would not</i><c>that would not provide</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>shelter enough</i><c>enough shelter</c></NS>. As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years. I consider myself to be good at this sport. As <NS type="TV"><i>regarding</i><c>regards</c></NS> painting, I know a lot <NS type="M"><c>about it</c></NS> since my grandmother <NS type="IV"><i>taugh</i><c>taught</c></NS> me when I was five years old.</p>
<p>Do you remember when I told you that my dream was <NS type="FV"><i>helping</i><c>to help</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Mano''s</i><c>Mano's</c></NS> group? Well, my dream <NS type="TV"><i>come</i><c>came</c></NS> true. <NS type="MA"><i>All</i><c>It all</c></NS> started when I was <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that <NS type="RP"><i>Mano''s</i><c>Mano's</c></NS> group were going to have a concert here, in Argentina. She also told me that she <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> some <NS type="S"><i>conections</i><c>connections</c></NS> with the people in charge of the lights <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the concert. You know that last year I <NS type="TV"><i>organise</i><c>organised</c></NS> the lights <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> our performance. So, there I was, <NS type="IV"><i>controling</i><c>controlling</c></NS> the illumination <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> Mano's concert!!!!</p>
<p>I will never forget that wonderful experience. <NS type="RA"><i>This</i><c>It</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>really help</i><c>has really helped</c></NS> me for our next performance <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Drama Club. It was so exciting to see <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>Mano'</i><c>Mano's</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>group</i></NS> singer that I felt as if I were in heaven!!</p>
<p>When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym <NS type="R">would retrieve my concerning</NS>. In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially in California.</p>
<p>However, things which you can get <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> money <NS type="M"><c>do not</c></NS> necessarily <NS type="RV">fill</NS> your <NS type="DN"><i>unsatisfaction</i><c>dissatisfaction</c></NS> or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be <NS type="RJ"><i>bigger</i><c>greater</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I'm writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you because I <NS type="TV"><i>had been asked</i><c>have been asked</c></NS> to make a little suggestion about the programme <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> have organised <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> our English class <NS type="RN"><i>travel</i><c>trip</c></NS>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure <NS type="RP"><i>show</i><c>Show</c></NS> and we would all like to go the show. We think it is a good opportunity because <NS type="RP"><i>london</i><c>London</c></NS> fashion is the most important <NS type="RT"><i>over</i><c>in</c></NS> the world, and we all <NS type="TV"><i>learn</i><c>will learn</c></NS> a lot about London style going to this show.</p>
<p>We think we could <NS type="RV">change</NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>shooping</i><c>shopping</c></NS> <NS type="MN"></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> to the show. The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March. It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon.</p>
<p>All the <NS type="RN"><i>clan</i><c>group</c></NS> would enjoy going <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the show, because it is a great <NS type="S"><i>oportunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to see an exhibition <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>of</c></NS> the latest fashions. We know that you have planned a very complete programme<NS type="UP"><i>. But</i><c> but</c></NS> we would like to suggest you <NS type="TV"><i>to move</i><c>move</c></NS> our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> so that<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we can go to the show<NS type="W"><i> on Tuesday, which lasts from 10 am to 7 pm</i><c>, which lasts from 10am to 7pm, on Tuesday</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Politicians, musicians or film <NS type="RN"><i>starts</i><c>stars</c></NS> are <NS type="RV"><i>controlled</i><c>watched</c></NS> all the time, <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>when</c></NS> they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do.</p>
<p>I am writing to give <NS type="FN"><i>suggestion</i><c>suggestions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the international art festival, which I <NS type="TV"><i>have been</i><c>went</c></NS> to one <NS type="AGN"><i>weeks</i><c>week</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>ago</c></NS>. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> is very interesting, especially for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS> very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world <NS type="M"><c>would be there</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement, but in fact they <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more <NS type="UJ"><i>different</i></NS> countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some <NS type="RN">concerts</NS> and halls <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> too small<NS type="RP"><i>, could</i><c>. Could</c></NS> you consider making them bigger next year<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS></p>
<p>Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> just don't <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>make</c></NS> trouble <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> my family<NS type="RP"><i>, that's</i><c>. That's</c></NS> all.</p>
<p>When the holidays <NS type="TV"><i>began</i><c>begin</c></NS> everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> most of us.</p>
<p>'As I have a <NS type="S"><i>choise</i><c>choice</c></NS> I would prefer to stay in log cabins <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>rather than</c></NS> tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so <NS type="DJ"><i>depended</i><c>dependent</c></NS> on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>photograher's</i><c>photographer's</c></NS> contest and I won a second prize in Poland in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>cathegory</i><c>category</c></NS> of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more <NS type="S"><i>familier</i><c>familiar</c></NS> with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would <NS type="W"><i>like also</i><c>also like</c></NS> to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is.</p>
<p>Thank you <NS type="R"><i>a lot</i><c>very much</c></NS> for your letter<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am very happy <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> having won the competition. I have several <NS type="RN"><i>precisions</i><c>things</c></NS> to tell you and some questions about the camp.</p>
<p>First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>job</c></NS> in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. I have already been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>different</i><c>other</c></NS> summer camps and I always choose this accommodation<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I find it more <NS type="RJ"><i>friendly</i><c>sociable</c></NS> than a log cabin.</p>
<p>I have chosen <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>from</c></NS> the activities <NS type="RJ"><i>proposed</i><c>offered</c></NS> to do photography<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I have already been <NS type="RN"><i>part</i><c>a member</c></NS> of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> climbing but I have never done it before.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>prepared</i><c>made</c></NS> sandwiches for all the staff <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the <NS type="RN"><i>viewers</i><c>audience</c></NS> all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage.</p>
<p>First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> a disappointing actor. Besides <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> the spectacle was <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>setted up</i><c>set up</c></NS></i><c>meant</c></NS> to <NS type="MV"><c>start</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe <NS type="UY"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>it</c></NS>, everything that was in the advertisement was a <NS type="RN"><i>fraud</i><c>lie</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>has</c></NS> ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> television came to my house<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was only seven, everybody was <NS type="RJ"><i>exciting</i><c>excited</c></NS> about the new "toy", however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> to rule our lives. <NS type="DY"><i>Unfortunatly</i><c>Unfortunately</c></NS> my parents did not realize how TV was <NS type="R">creating a role</NS> among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to <NS type="DJ"><i>science</i><c>scientific</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>development</i><c>developments</c></NS>, I am getting better, recovering from <NS type="S"><i>ahsma</i><c>asthma</c></NS>. In addition to this it is wonderful not <NS type="FV"><i>have</i><c>to have</c></NS> to wait too long to eat, thanks <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>microwaves invention</i><c>invention of microwaves</c></NS>. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological <NS type="RN"><i>facilities</i><c>devices</c></NS>, but a very happy and united family.</p>
<p>As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important <NS type="M"><c>ones were</c></NS> concerning wearing <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> suitable clothes, <NS type="FV"><i>to arrive</i><c>arriving</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> time and <NS type="FV"><i>get</i><c>getting</c></NS> on with every teacher and authority <NS type="MN"><c>figure</c></NS>. As a consequence, most <NS type="RN"><i>mates</i><c>schoolmates</c></NS> used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them.</p>
<p>I had a <NS type="SX"><i>vary</i><c>very</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>dissappointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>evining</i><c>evening</c></NS> last <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS>. I had <NS type="S"><i>everythig</i><c>everything</c></NS> planned<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> <NS type="L"><i>I and my family</i><c>my family and I</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> coming to <NS type="S"><i>whatch</i><c>watch</c></NS> your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was <NS type="S"><i>disasterous</i><c>disastrous</c></NS>. Firstly there was no <NS type="W"><i>available discount</i><c>discount available</c></NS>, <NS type="RC"><i>as</i><c>though</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>promised</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> so even my <NS type="MP"><i>6 year old</i><c>6-year-old</c></NS> son was charged <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> adult price. Then everything was going well <NS type="S"><i>untill</i><c>until</c></NS> the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30<NS type="MP"><i> well</i><c>. Well</c></NS> it didn't<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And <NS type="RP"><i>By</i><c>by</c></NS> the way may I ask you how <NS type="MP"><i>up to date</i><c>up-to-date</c></NS> your leaflets are because in spite of the <NS type="RP"><i>ad vert</i><c>advert</c></NS> saying the <NS type="DJ"><i>staring</i><c>starring</c></NS> actor was Danny Brook, <NS type="UY"><i>well</i></NS> it wasn't. It was <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor <NS type="M"><c>and one</c></NS> I had never heard of. That was a <NS type="S"><i>dissapointment</i><c>disappointment</c></NS> for my whole family<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RP"><i>infact</i><c>in fact</c></NS></i><c>. In fact</c></NS> all the <NS type="RN"><i>viewers</i><c>audience</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>where</i><c>were</c></NS> very <NS type="DJ"><i>dissappointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Our homes will still be the same in terms of the <NS type="RN"><i>kitchen</i><c>cuisine</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't <NS type="RV"><i>miss</i><c>give up</c></NS> the great taste of food<NS type="MP"><i> although</i><c>. Although</c></NS> it could be <NS type="S"><i>subsituted</i><c>substituted</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> a vitamin pill or two.</p>
<p>Are you fed up <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> response to the <NS type="RP"><i>international</i><c>International</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>Arsts</i><c>Arts</c></NS> Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that it was a great idea and <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RJ">valuable</NS> <NS type="S"><i>activitie</i><c>activity</c></NS> as a social event.</p>
<p>It wasn't <NS type="RJ"><i>complicated</i><c>difficult</c></NS> to find the right hall <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the shows, I <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>would</c></NS> say it was very well organised.</p>
<p>Finally, I <NS type="S"><i>preciate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS> your <NS type="RN">organisation</NS> and look forward to hearing <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> the next International Arts Festival.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad <NS type="CN"><i>behaviours</i><c>behaviour</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> punished. For example, you have to do more <NS type="CN"><i>homeworks</i><c>homework</c></NS> or they <NS type="TV"><i>are sending</i><c>send</c></NS> you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> any part of the <NS type="S"><i>schol</i><c>school</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The activities that I'd like to do: <NS type="MD"><i><NS type="RP"><i>First</i><c>first</c></NS></i><c>the first</c></NS> one <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> I used to be a basketball player in my high school<NS type="RP"><i>. <NS type="MD"><i>Second</i><c>The second</c></NS></i><c>; the second</c></NS> activity <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> would be tennis<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am not <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> expert <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this <NS type="UA"><i>one</i></NS> because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>; <NS type="FV"><i>serve</i><c>serving</c></NS> the ball, <NS type="RP"><i>back hand</i><c>backhand</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>fore hand</i><c>forehand</c></NS> to hit the ball.</p>
<p>Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>?</i><c>.</c></NS> Do I have to bring swimming <NS type="RN"><i>suit</i><c>trunks</c></NS> if I want to swim <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the camp? How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS>?</p>
<p>I'm <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> happy to <NS type="FV"><i>heard</i><c>hear</c></NS> that I have won the first prize. Here is the information you want from me.  Firstly, I can only go in July<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> I'm <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> holiday <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> that <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>time</c></NS>. I think I would prefer <NS type="R">the accommodation at Camp California is in tents</NS><NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> it is more <NS type="DJ"><i>safety</i><c>safe</c></NS>, and I <NS type="TV"><i>don't</i><c>wouldn't</c></NS> like to be in the log cabins.</p>
<p>I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I <NS type="TV"><i>have seen</i><c>saw</c></NS> last Sunday<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the evening.</p>
<p>I <NS type="RV"><i>became</i><c>came</c></NS> to notice the difference <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> work, since <NS type="UY"><i>when</i></NS> all tasks <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> changed to</i><c>were performed on</c></NS> the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>At</c></NS> that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge. <NS type="RY"><i>Firstly</i><c>First</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>become</i><c>became</c></NS></i><c>came</c></NS> to write letters and articles, next I learned several <NS type="FN"><i>computers</i><c>computer</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>plays</i><c>games</c></NS>. <NS type="MT"><i>When</i><c>From when</c></NS> I learned how to use <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, I <NS type="RV"><i>didn't</i><c>haven't</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>stop</i><c>stopped</c></NS> until now.</p>
<p>Even if my parents don't <NS type="CE">look after me for all the matters</NS> like going out <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>nights</i><c>night</c></NS> or studying you <NS type="TV"><i>don't have to think</i><c>shouldn't think</c></NS> that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends <NS type="MY"><c>over</c></NS> for a Saturday night party.</p>
<p>I am writing to you first of all to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme that you <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>have given</c></NS> us <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London, especially for planning <NS type="R"><i>to visit</i><c>a visit to</c></NS> the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting.</p>
<p>In addition <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> students it is completely free.</p>
<p>You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>. Why? Because he <NS type="RY">especially</NS> concentrates on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> history, <NS type="RN"><i>social life</i><c>society</c></NS> and <NS type="RJ"><i>politic</i><c>political</c></NS> situation <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the time the story is <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>set</c></NS>. That <NS type="RV"><i>might</i><c>can</c></NS> be <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>complicated</i><c>difficult</c></NS> to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She <NS type="W"><i>especially write books</i><c>writes books especially</c></NS> for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite <NS type="S"><i>intered</i><c>interested</c></NS> in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>There</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>also will</i><c>will also</c></NS> be "The London <NS type="RP"><i>fashion and leisure show</i><c>Fashion and Leisure Show</c></NS>" on the 14th of March, which <NS type="AGV"><i>consist</i><c>consists</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>of</c></NS> an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles. <NS type="UY"><i>Indeed it</i><c>It</c></NS> will be free for us as we are students.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>understood</i><c>understand</c></NS> that you're looking for <NS type="W"><i>your cousin's birthday present</i><c>a birthday present for your cousin</c></NS>, and you'd like <NS type="FV"><i>give</i><c>to give</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>him</i><c>her</c></NS> a book, which, I think, <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie Brontë. It's a <NS type="S"><i>fantastique</i><c>fantastic</c></NS> book, which I recommend to everybody keen on <NS type="RP"><i>lovestories</i><c>love stories</c></NS>. It's a perfect <NS type="S"><i>combinaison</i><c>combination</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>of</c></NS> passion and <NS type="MP"><i>life</i><c>life's</c></NS> difficulties. I <NS type="S"><i>recone</i><c>reckon</c></NS> that it's <NS type="UY"><i>quite</i></NS> not an easy <NS type="RN"><i>reading</i><c>read</c></NS>, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's <NS type="R"><i>such</i><c>so</c></NS> good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>litteracy</i><c>literacy</c></NS></i><c>literature</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her <NS type="S"><i>personnality</i><c>personality</c></NS>. It'll be a good point for her general <NS type="RN"><i>culture</i><c>education</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> Wuthering Heights <NS type="UA"><i>it's</i><c>is</c></NS> a classic, which everybody knows about <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>, even if they <NS type="UV"><i>didn't have</i><c>haven't</c></NS> read it, they<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> at <NS type="S"><i>liest</i><c>least</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> know the story.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Computer</i><c>A computer</c></NS> is <NS type="S"><i>extrrmely</i><c>extremely</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>convenient</i><c>helpful</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> writing reports and essays. And, of course, I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> forget about cars and planes that <NS type="RV"><i>deliver</i><c>take</c></NS> us to all parts of the Earth.</p>
<p>Counting <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RV">working out</NS> and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway. <NS type="MD"><i>Modern</i><c>A modern</c></NS> girl or boy <NS type="X"><i>already would not be able</i><c>is already unable</c></NS> to imagine life without them.</p>
<p>I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>its</i><c>an</c></NS> advertisement yesterday. It is <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It starts at 10.00 am and finishes <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 19.00 pm. The date of the show is <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> Tuesday <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 14th of March. It <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London. We would like to go there because it is very popular nowadays. I've heard that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles are really wonderful. It is also free for students. We all know that you <NS type="TV"><i>organised</i><c>have organised</c></NS> everything. However, we can change the programme. Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you <NS type="RV"><i>know</i><c>have</c></NS>. We have <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> free <NS type="RN"><i>timer</i><c>time</c></NS> on Wednesday <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> shopping quickly after sightseeing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> London.</p>
<p>A DAY <NS type="RT"><i>OF</i><c>IN</c></NS> MY LIFE</p>
<p>I am writing about our class trip to London. First of all, I appreciate <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> well-organised programme, especially<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> "River Trip to Greenwich" which we requested. It <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be the most <NS type="SX"><i>excising</i><c>exciting</c></NS> activity <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this trip.</p>
<p>However, I saw the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> "THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW" in the newspaper today, and told all <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> classmates about it. We are very interested in going <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> this show. So I would like to suggest you <NS type="FV"><i>to change</i><c>change</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> part of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>so we can</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>visiting</i><c>visit</c></NS> this show.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our <NS type="S"><i>programm</i><c>programme</c></NS> is fixed but I think we could change <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> part of the programme. For example, "shopping on 14<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> March' can be changed to 15<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> March instead of "Free time". So we will be able to use the time <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the afternoon on 14<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> March for visiting the show.</p>
<p>I have received <NS type="R"><i>your</i><c>the</c></NS> good news and I'm very happy because I have always <NS type="RV"><i>wished</i><c>wanted</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>to go</c></NS> to California and now it's <NS type="L"><i>real</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>happening</c></NS>, so, thank you very much <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> that.</p>
<p>First <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> all, I would like to give you some further information <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>about</c></NS> me and secondly, <NS type="TV"><i>I'll</i><c>I'd</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>ask</i><c>to ask</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> some <NS type="RN"><i>doubts</i><c>concerns</c></NS> that I have.</p>
<p>I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much. <NS type="R">Besides</NS>, she told me that you are very keen to know <NS type="R"><i>how was</i><c>about</c></NS> my experience, so I'll give you some information in this letter that I'm sure you will be glad <NS type="MV"><c>to have</c></NS>, even <NS type="MC"><c>though</c></NS> you have not been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the concert.</p>
<p>First <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> all, I'll tell you that <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the day <NS type="M"><c>of the</c></NS> concert I woke up at 6:30 <NS type="RP"><i>A.M</i><c>a.m.</c></NS>, very early for me<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> know me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I'm <NS type="S"><i>lazzy</i><c>lazy</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> work began around 8:30<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>It</c></NS> was very hard but <NS type="RC"><i>when</i><c>then</c></NS> the band <NS type="TV"><i>come</i><c>came</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>training</i><c>to train</c></NS></i><c>to rehearse</c></NS><NS type="R"><i><NS type="RP"><i>, since</i><c>. Since</c></NS></i><c>. From</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> moment I <NS type="TV"><i>was <NS type="SX"><i>enjoining</i><c>enjoying</c></NS></i><c>enjoyed</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to work</i><c>working</c></NS> until the concert had finished<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>every one</i><c>everyone</c></NS> who was working because they understood that <NS type="MV"><c>putting on</c></NS> a concert is a job to be done by a team. During the concert I listened <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the band like everybody <NS type="MY"><c>else</c></NS>, besides I earned money<NS type="RP"><i> so,</i><c>, so</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was a wonderful experience.</p>
<p>On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that we saw advertised and we are interested <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UY"><i>indeed</i></NS>. In addition we would like to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the programme.</p>
<p>I would like to mention that <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> shopping, so I believe it will be a good <NS type="RN"><i>change</i><c>chance</c></NS> for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is <NS type="RJ"><i>suitable</i><c>compatible</c></NS> as well with our programme because <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>by</c></NS> 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> what <NS type="UV"><i>does</i></NS> it <NS type="AGV"><i>include</i><c>includes</c></NS>. The latest <NS type="FN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS> will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover <NS type="R">all about the make up and the hairstyles</NS>. I think that <NS type="AS"><i>it will be a great opportunity to all of us to be on this show</i><c>this show will be a great opportunity for all of us</c></NS> while we are <NS type="UV"><i>going to be</i></NS> in London. But<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if there is a problem <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>because</c></NS> the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same <NS type="RN"><i>hour</i><c>time</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="M"><i>shopping</i><c>our shopping trip</c></NS>, I suggest <NS type="RV"><i>having</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> shopping on Wednesday afternoon <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>when</c></NS> we will not have anything to do!</p>
<p>I believe<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that if somebody wants <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> fame and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> glory <NS type="MA"><c>he</c></NS> must be <NS type="S"><i>tottally</i><c>totally</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>sure</i><c>clear</c></NS> about the results. For example, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> politicians <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> have <NS type="IV"><i>choosed</i><c>chosen</c></NS> their careers<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> they must know that <NS type="R">they are going to involved with everything that it has to do with publicity and their country</NS> and the most important <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> their movements or else they are going to have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> bad reputation, and they will <NS type="W"><i>be not</i><c>not be</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>considered</c></NS> trustworthy.</p>
<p>Secondly, I wonder if you know <NS type="R"><i>it will have</i><c>that the</c></NS> "London fashion and Leisure <NS type="MN"><c>Show</c></NS>" <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>showed</i><c>held</c></NS> on Tuesday <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will <NS type="RV">introduce</NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is <NS type="L"><i>most</i><c>very</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>interested in</i><c>interesting to</c></NS> us<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="R">I mean it's conflict</NS> with your plan<NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>. What</c></NS> a pity!</p>
<p>All of us want to go to the show<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> generation who are the same <NS type="SX"><i>ago</i><c>age</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>as</c></NS> us all like <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS>, <NS type="R">become beautiful</NS>, and it's important that it will <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> free for students and just be <NS type="RV">showed</NS> <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> one day. So, we don't want <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>lose</i><c>to lose</c></NS></i><c>to miss</c></NS> this chance.</p>
<p>The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> stars and <NS type="FN"><i>artist</i><c>artists</c></NS> coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get <NS type="RJ"><i>used</i><c>acquainted</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> more cultures by inviting <NS type="MN"><c>guests</c></NS> from some other countries too.</p>
<p>It was really a <NS type="UP"><i>reasonably-priced</i><c>reasonably priced</c></NS> weekend for me, but you should also <NS type="RV"><i>recognise</i><c>introduce</c></NS> new activities like competitions <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> singing songs<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>or</c></NS> drawing a <NS type="S"><i>portrate</i><c>portrait</c></NS> next year. Then it would be excellent.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about a <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show that I saw <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her <NS type="UP"><i>school's</i><c>school</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>class-matters</i><c>classmates</c></NS> were going to <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>throw</c></NS> their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That <NS type="UN"><i>day</i></NS> afternoon they arrived at Paula's house <NS type="U"><i>in order</i></NS> to decorate the place. <NS type="S"><i>Ballons</i><c>Balloons</c></NS> and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of <NS type="RJ"><i>delightful</i><c>delicious</c></NS> food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later <NS type="R"><i>all the things were</i><c>everything was</c></NS> finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they <NS type="TV"><i>had been planned</i><c>had planned</c></NS>. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this.</p>
<p>Ordinary lessons attended by students <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> different levels <NS type="M"><c>of ability</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I'm writing to thank you <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> the great opportunity you <NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>are giving</c></NS> us, especially in <NS type="IV"><i>planing</i><c>planning</c></NS> all this programme in <NS type="W"><i>a such</i><c>such <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS></c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>acurate</i><c>accurate</c></NS> way. I think that this programme <NS type="RV"><i>has</i><c>is</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="MP"><i><NS type="DY"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>organisation</i><c>organised</c></NS></i><c>well-organised</c></NS>, as you know, <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points. But<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I was wondering, <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> a student of this college, if we <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>could</c></NS> change part of this programme ... we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock. In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>then</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> we can go to the show.</p>
<p>Do you think you've <NS type="MV"><c>got</c></NS> the future in your hands? Do you think we're living like <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>old</i><c>olden</c></NS> times? Would you like <NS type="FV"><i>living</i><c>to live</c></NS> in a modern way? What do you expect <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> the future? Can you compare it ...? Are you afraid?</p>
<p>Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of instruments <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> washing up the dishes, <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to cook</i><c>cooking</c></NS> to be more <NS type="RJ"><i>comfortable</i><c>convenient</c></NS>, for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the TV, the video recorder, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe, in a few <NS type="MP"><i>years</i><c>years'</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>later</i><c>time</c></NS> we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, <NS type="ID"><i>from my point of view</i><c>in my opinion</c></NS>, I think these facts will not change <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>our</c></NS> way of <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="IN"><i>lifes</i><c>lives</c></NS></i><c>life</c></NS>. We will be able to <NS type="RV"><i>accelerate</i><c>speed up</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>process</i><c>running</c></NS> of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>computer's</i><c>computer</c></NS> games<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for example... But not in <NS type="RQ"><i>the</i><c>any</c></NS> strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>aereoplanes</i><c>aeroplanes</c></NS>...</p>
<p>All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> are interested in fashion and <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS>, so we are expecting the show <NS type="FV"><i>will be</i><c>to be</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> great opportunity to see what the new <NS type="FN"><i>trend</i><c>trends</c></NS> in fashion will be like. It would be <NS type="RJ"><i>grateful</i><c>great</c></NS> if you <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>gave</c></NS></i><c>made</c></NS> a little change in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has <NS type="W"><i>considerably been changed</i><c>been changed considerably</c></NS> by <NS type="S"><i>rapdily</i><c>rapidly</c></NS> developing <NS type="S"><i>mordern</i><c>modern</c></NS> technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning <NS type="CN"><i>woods</i><c>wood</c></NS> to warm a room up and make food.  Since the <NS type="S"><i>eletric</i><c>electric</c></NS> fire and microwave oven had been invented, their <NS type="AGN"><i>life</i><c>lives</c></NS> have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend <NS type="CQ"><i>many</i><c>much</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>times</i><c>time</c></NS> on making food, washing up, or even on turning <NS type="W"><i>on <NS type="SX"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> off the light</i><c>the light on and off</c></NS>.  Machines, such as <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>dish washer</i><c>dishwasher</c></NS>, <NS type="DN"><i>laundry machine</i><c>washing machine</c></NS> and remote <NS type="RN"><i>controller</i><c>control</c></NS> help us <NS type="SX"><i>jut</i><c>just</c></NS> to relax or do a little <NS type="W"><i>work necessary</i><c>necessary work</c></NS>. <NS type="ID"><i>From my point of view</i><c>In my opinion</c></NS>, people's <NS type="FN"><i>home</i><c>homes</c></NS> in the future will be controlled by a computer which is <NS type="RV"><i>devised</i><c>built</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> every machine, TV, cooker and the light, <NS type="TV"><i>connecting</i><c>connected</c></NS> to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a "family".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. <NS type="MD"><i>Computer</i><c>A computer</c></NS> might know <NS type="RY"><i>better</i><c>more</c></NS> than <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> human, but there are many things which it <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> replace in our life.</p>
<p>I would like to go to "Camp California" <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will have to produce "Mission Impossible III" from August. I will be busy <NS type="FV"><i>to decide</i><c>deciding</c></NS> everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there.</p>
<p>By the way, <NS type="RP"><i>Do</i><c>do</c></NS> you want to hear <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> my experience <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> pop concert? OK! Here we go!</p>
<p>Hoping <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>some</c></NS> locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> having such <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>especial</i><c>special</c></NS> opportunity <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.</p>
<p>We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was <NS type="SX"><i>find</i><c>fine</c></NS>, but <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the second week I got very <NS type="SX"><i>seek</i><c>sick</c></NS>. I think it was the water. My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one.</p>
<p>You want to hear about my experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> helping at a pop concert. You can't imagine how <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS> it was! You could do so many things because you received a <NS type="UP"><i>free-pass</i><c>free pass</c></NS> which allowed you to go where you wanted and <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> was what I <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>had prefer</i><c>preferred</c></NS></i><c>liked</c></NS> about this experience.</p>
<p>Lastly, it could be nice <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> students who are interested in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> arts, if you <NS type="RV"><i>help</i><c>offer</c></NS> special events, for instance, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> song contest, writing competition or dance lessons.</p>
<p>Do you need money? If you do, <NS type="RV">make sure</NS> why you want to earn money. That is very important to find a way <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> earning and saving money.</p>
<p>If you just decide to work, you'd better <NS type="FV"><i>to find</i><c>find</c></NS> a job <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>near</c></NS> your place. Firstly, go to your school or local council. They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you. Secondly, <NS type="SX"><i>as</i><c>ask</c></NS> your family or friends. As they know about your <NS type="DN"><i>interestings</i><c>interests</c></NS> and personality, it is easy to help you. In my case, <NS type="CE">I could get a telephone researcher part by my friend's reference.</NS></p>
<p>I had such a desire to go to the disco<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I decided to go even without <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>parent's</i><c>parents'</c></NS> permission. I told my secret to my best friend<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> Pat. But she told it to <NS type="SX"><i>very</i><c>every</c></NS> kid in school, even the teachers heard it. It <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>occured</i><c>occurred</c></NS></i><c>happened</c></NS> that one of the teachers told my parents about it. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks.</p>
<p>Well, about rules in my <NS type="S"><i>contry</i><c>country</c></NS>, <NS type="M"><c>the situation</c></NS> is not different <NS type="R"><i>than</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> countries. The rules must be <NS type="TV"><i>respect</i><c>respected</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> all people if you don't want <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>get</i><c>to get</c></NS></i><c>to be kicked</c></NS> out <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>scholl</i><c>school</c></NS>. You must <NS type="FV"><i>to be</i><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>organise</i><c>organised</c></NS>, clean and respect the <NS type="FN"><i>right</i><c>rights</c></NS> of other people.<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS></p>
<p>First of all, the actor was different from <NS type="M"><c>the one mentioned in</c></NS> your advertisement. I <NS type="TV"><i>meant</i><c>mean</c></NS> he was not Danny Brook. Secondly, <NS type="R">it took times to wait</NS> about <NS type="MP"><i>forty five</i><c>forty-five</c></NS> minutes, because it started at 20:15. <NS type="R">It should be on time at 19:30. Then it had no discounts, which the advertisement said so</NS>. Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> your ticket <NS type="MN"><c>price</c></NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant <NS type="W"><i><NS type="TV"><i>was early closed</i><c>early closed</c></NS></i><c>closed early</c></NS>. As soon as the show ended, I went <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> there <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>having</i><c>to have</c></NS> a dessert.</p>
<p>While she was choosing vegetables <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a market, she came across him. When he asked her<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> '<NS type="RP"><i>why</i><c>Why</c></NS> do you choose <NS type="RY"><i>deliberately</i><c>carefully</c></NS>?', she answered without thinking. That caused the secret <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> disclosed.</p>
<p>As you <NS type="TV"><i>tell</i><c>told</c></NS> me in your last letter<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you were talking about rules in your class and you <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I must tell you that <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> mum and dad are great but there's one main rule<NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> I must tell them <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> I <NS type="TV"><i>go</i><c>am going</c></NS> and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem <NS type="MC"><c>because</c></NS> she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of clothes I should wear but I don't <NS type="R"><i>care about it</i><c>take any notice of her</c></NS>.</p>
<p>However, some of them have read an <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March. The Exhibition will show all the latest <NS type="FN"><i>fashion</i><c>fashions</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>over</c></NS> a very wide range from <NS type="RP"><i>sports wear</i><c>sportswear</c></NS> to <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and even hairstyles. What is more, the show is free for all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> students. We feel that taking part <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> it would be a great opportunity <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> us since we will be able to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our <NS type="RN"><i>days</i><c>time</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="ID">Under the circumstances</NS>, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> be possible to make some changes <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the programme if it <NS type="R">could to visit</NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Exhibition</i><c>exhibition</c></NS>. It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to <NS type="ID"><i>19.00pm</i><c>7.00pm</c></NS>, so we could give up <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> shopping and go to the show in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Being <NS type="CL"><i>famous and <NS type="SX"><i>risk</i><c>rich</c></NS></i><c>rich and famous</c></NS> is something all of us have dreamt of <NS type="RY"><i>sometimes</i><c>at some time</c></NS>. But <NS type="X"><i>not always famous people are</i><c>famous people aren't always</c></NS> happy <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> their <NS type="RN"><i>condition</i><c>situation</c></NS>. Usually if you ask them what they <NS type="UV"><i>would</i></NS> desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>"</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly <NS type="RJ"><i>tight</i><c>right</c></NS> that famous people accept their <NS type="RN"><i>condition</i><c>situation</c></NS>, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings<NS type="RP"><i>, on</i><c>. On</c></NS> the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and <NS type="S"><i>depresed</i><c>depressed</c></NS>: <NS type="X"><i>not always, in fact, money and celebrity <NS type="RV"><i>being</i><c>bring</c></NS></i><c>in fact, money and celebrity don't always bring</c></NS> happiness.</p>
<p>First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. <NS type="M"><i>Because</i><c>This is because</c></NS> I intend to take <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> examination in <NS type="S"><i>Septenber</i><c>September</c></NS>. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time <NS type="FV"><i>to experience</i><c>experiencing</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to stay</i><c>staying</c></NS> there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.</p>
<p>The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> it. And <NS type="RY"><i>nowadays</i><c>recently</c></NS>, I have been <NS type="SA"><i>practicing</i><c>practising</c></NS> tennis as <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis.</p>
<p>Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how <NS type="RJ"><i>grateful</i><c>great</c></NS> it was. All <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> work I needed to do wasn't very interesting. <NS type="UA"><i>which</i></NS> I must have set thousands <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> setting chairs just before they started <NS type="SA"><i>practicing</i><c>practising</c></NS>. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as <NS type="M"><c>a member of the</c></NS> audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never <NS type="TV"><i>sit</i><c>sat</c></NS> down there. Additionally, you <NS type="RV"><i>couldn't</i><c>won't</c></NS> believe <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>, but the vocalist said "All the chairs you are sitting <NS type="UY"><i>down</i></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>on</c></NS> were set <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> him," pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory.</p>
<p>Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we <NS type="RV"><i>can</i><c>would</c></NS> have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>our</c></NS> free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion.</p>
<p>I played Basketball at school for about two years. I am rather good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it. I also had Painting as <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> main subject at school for five years. I like painting very much, and I think I am good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> Painting. I paint a lot in my free time. I prefer painting landscapes and <NS type="RP"><i>fantasy-pictures</i><c>fantasy pictures</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the <NS type="RN"><i>brake</i><c>break</c></NS>. The smokers in the school yard, the <NS type="S"><i>buffett</i><c>buffet</c></NS> and the other pupils, who are sitting <NS type="RT"><i>in front of</i><c>at</c></NS> their tables <NS type="RV"><i>writing</i><c>doing</c></NS> their homework.</p>
<p>Recently, we <NS type="TV"><i>have had</i><c>had</c></NS> a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, <NS type="M"><c>and the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> before. My father is a sailor and I <NS type="RV"><i>meet</i><c>see</c></NS> him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile <NS type="FN"><i>phone</i><c>phones</c></NS> I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. This way I don't have to <NS type="UV"><i>do</i></NS> be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>At the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS></i><c>First of all</c></NS> I would like to thank you. Now I am going to give you some further <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>:</c></NS> I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in <NS type="RP"><i>High</i><c>high</c></NS> school and this is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> most important year of my life<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I am studying <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of June I will <NS type="TV"><i>be having</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> university entrance exam <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> after that<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in July<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am going to be alright.</p>
<p>I would prefer <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> because I have never <NS type="TV"><i>stay</i><c>stayed</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> before and I am wondering <NS type="RA"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> it is going to be like<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> And <NS type="RT"><i>among</i><c>from</c></NS> these activities I <NS type="TV"><i>am choosing</i><c>will choose</c></NS> basketball and swimming<NS type="RP"><i>. Basketball</i><c>: basketball</c></NS> because I am very good at it, swimming because I like to swim very much but I'm not a very good swimmer. And finally I would like to ask you some questions. My first question is about clothes; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us? <NS type="RP"><i>and</i><c>And</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>How</i><c>how</c></NS> much money do we need to take?</p>
<p>If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic <NS type="UP"><i>alarm-clock</i><c>alarm clock</c></NS> wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>..." There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> and can learn anything while surfing <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you in reply to your letter. I was really <NS type="S"><i>suprised</i><c>surprised</c></NS> when I opened it. I look <NS type="S"><i>forword</i><c>forward</c></NS> to going to the Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August and I will have to look after them. I prefer staying in <NS type="SX"><i>tens</i><c>tents</c></NS> to staying in log cabins<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> it <NS type="S"><i>remainds</i><c>reminds</c></NS> me <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> my childhood. I used to <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>go</c></NS> with my friends to <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> camp, <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> was <NS type="S"><i>situeded</i><c>situated</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> seaside.</p>
<p>I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many <NS type="AGN"><i>disadvantage</i><c>disadvantages</c></NS> of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything <NS type="UA"><i>what</i></NS> they want. It isn't true. <NS type="S"><i>Nowdays</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS> we have many big shopping <NS type="SA"><i>centers</i><c>centres</c></NS>. We like them because everything is <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> one place. The most suitable time for shopping is <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>weekand</i><c>weekend</c></NS> when parents don't work and children haven't got <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> school. Because of that<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> shopping <NS type="SA"><i>centers</i><c>centres</c></NS> are <NS type="RP"><i>over crowded</i><c>overcrowded</c></NS>. You can't buy something in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>peacful</i><c>peaceful</c></NS> and calm <NS type="S"><i>athmospher</i><c>atmosphere</c></NS>. In addition<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in <NS type="RD"><i>such</i><c>this</c></NS> kind of shops <NS type="RN"><i>prizes</i><c>prices</c></NS> are very high, of course not all of them. However such <NS type="SA"><i>centers</i><c>centres</c></NS> are very useful and necessary. <NS type="SX"><i>I</i><c>In</c></NS> my opinion the worst thing which may <NS type="FV"><i>happened</i><c>happen</c></NS> is <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>extremly</i><c>extremely</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>hugh</i><c>huge</c></NS></i><c>long</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>queu</i><c>queue</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> be enjoyable. If you bought something <NS type="S"><i>goregous</i><c>gorgeous</c></NS>, you <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>are in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> bad mood don't go shopping.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>in the name of</i><c>on behalf of</c></NS> the class for your <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> <NS type="RN">organisation</NS> and programme, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Especially</i><c>especially</c></NS> for the fact that you are giving us some free time. We really appreciate this.</p>
<p>However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from <NS type="ID"><i>10 oo to 19 oo o'clock</i><c>10 to 7 o'clock</c></NS> in the Central Exhibition Hall. <NS type="W"><i>There will be shown the latest fashions <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>in</c></NS> leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles</i><c>The latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown there</c></NS>.</p>
<p>This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't <NS type="W"><i>been ever before</i><c>ever before been</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> this kind of show. As well as this, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> entrance for students is free.</p>
<p>In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press<NS type="RP"><i>. Just</i><c>, just</c></NS> because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The <NS type="DN">yellow press</NS> is searching for every little <NS type="MQ"><c>bit of</c></NS> information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> just to take a picture of them <NS type="R"><i>on</i><c>to show</c></NS> how they eat or with <NS type="RA"><i>who</i><c>whom</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>meat</i><c>meet</c></NS>. The photos will be <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> tomorrow's press and so rumours are born.</p>
<p>After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I <NS type="UV"><i>had</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to realize</i><c>realised</c></NS> that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> the show<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> had been <NS type="RV"><i>traded</i><c>replaced</c></NS> by <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> actor, who couldn't sing <NS type="UC"><i>as</i></NS> half as <NS type="DY"><i>good</i><c>well</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>then</i><c>as</c></NS> Brook.</p>
<p>After one hour the <NS type="W"><i>hohle</i><c>whole</c></NS> class had heard about Sarah's secret. Everybody was interested in what she had won but <NS type="S"><i>knowbody</i><c>nobody</c></NS> wanted to ask Sarah because it was told <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>as</c></NS> a secret to them. Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> talking and <NS type="S"><i>wispering</i><c>whispering</c></NS> started. Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him<NS type="MP"><i> did</i><c>, "Did</c></NS> you tell anybody about our secret<NS type="MP"><i>.</i><c>?"</c></NS> Pat told her everything. Sarah looked at him for a while, <NS type="SX"><i>than</i><c>then</c></NS> she stood in front of the class and <NS type="IV"><i>explaind</i><c>explained</c></NS> to the others<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that she <NS type="TV"><i>won</i><c>had won</c></NS> a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the <NS type="RN"><i>sea</i><c>coast</c></NS> of southern France and <NS type="R"><i>everybody</i><c>every one</c></NS> of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>It</i><c>I</c></NS> was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday<NS type="RP"><i>, you</i><c>. You</c></NS> asked me about rules<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> both <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> my home and at my school<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am very happy to tell you about this.</p>
<p>Timson's wife, who was <NS type="MP"><i>good looking</i><c>good-looking</c></NS> and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He <NS type="W"><i>even couldn't</i><c>couldn't even</c></NS> say a word. He tried to <NS type="RV"><i>make up</i><c>think</c></NS> who could <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>have given</c></NS></i><c>have told</c></NS> his wife <NS type="UV"><i>knows</i></NS>. Of course, only one person <NS type="TV"><i>had known</i><c>knew</c></NS> this <NS type="RT"><i>except</i><c>apart from</c></NS> his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> up.</p>
<p><NS type="MD"><i>Next</i><c>The next</c></NS> day<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> new secretary. It was the worst <NS type="FN"><i>weekends</i><c>weekend</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> last few years. On the other hand, now everything is <NS type="RP"><i>o.k</i><c>OK</c></NS>. Timson has a good close family, his son lives with them, his company <NS type="TV"><i>makes</i><c>is making</c></NS> a good profit... Only Pat has problems, she <NS type="CE">should earn her living in other company again</NS>!</p>
<p>Because <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> this situation I <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> be very busy <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the first week of <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS>, and I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>apreciate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if you <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> give me the <NS type="RN"><i>choice</i><c>option</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>start</i><c>begin</c></NS> my "Camp California" <NS type="MN"><c>experience</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>on</c></NS> July 10th. About the <NS type="S"><i>Accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> I would prefer to sleep <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>, because I <NS type="TV"><i>never been</i><c>have never been</c></NS> in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins.</p>
<p>When I was a child I never <NS type="TV"><i>like</i><c>liked</c></NS> to go shopping because my Mum <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> so much time <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the shops that I remember <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> going shopping with her<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> was a <NS type="S"><i>nigthmare</i><c>nightmare</c></NS>. It is <NS type="S"><i>ameaising</i><c>amazing</c></NS> how people change <NS type="ID"><i>during the years</i><c>over the years</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, for example</i><c>For example</c></NS> now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something. I enjoy <NS type="W"><i>so much fashion</i><c>fashion so much</c></NS> that my life <NS type="TV"><i>change</i><c>has changed</c></NS> completely since I <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>started</c></NS> to study <NS type="DN"><i>clothes designer</i><c>fashion design</c></NS> and I <NS type="TV"><i>discover</i><c>discovered</c></NS> that fabrics, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> colors, are really enjoyable. But <NS type="ID"><i>in this days</i><c>these days</c></NS> shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer <NS type="MN"></NS> and you pay <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> full price, <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the end of the season it is half price<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I find <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> very <NS type="S"><i>anfair</i><c>unfair</c></NS> for people who pay a lot of money <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> their clothes. Anyway, shopping is <NS type="S"><i>allways</i><c>always</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>satisfation</i><c>satisfaction</c></NS></i><c>satisfying</c></NS> for rich people, because they can <NS type="FV"><i>afforded</i><c>afford</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> and they don't <NS type="SX"><i>main</i><c>mind</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to <NS type="RV"><i>spend</i><c>pay</c></NS></i><c>paying</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> full price <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>for</c></NS> their clothes.</p>
<p>In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert was great.</p>
<p>I write <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you because last <NS type="RP"><i>friday</i><c>Friday</c></NS> I had a very disappointing evening <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre. I went there because I had read a <NS type="RN">banner</NS> about the musical show "Over the rainbow", but <NS type="RQ"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> wrong.</p>
<p>But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the <NS type="W"><i>show of 2.30 p.m.</i><c>2.30 pm show</c></NS>, we couldn't enter <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> the theatre because the discounts weren't available. So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes <NS type="RT"><i>until</i><c>for</c></NS> the beginning of the show! <NS type="RY"><i>No</i><c>Not</c></NS> only <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS>: we had the bad surprise that Brook had been <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>substituded</i><c>substituted</c></NS></i><c>replaced</c></NS> by another actor!</p>
<p>The inventions of the <NS type="SA"><i>airplane</i><c>aeroplane</c></NS>, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and <NS type="RT"><i>after</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few minutes I can <NS type="RV"><i>stay</i><c>be</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the other side of Lecce to play piano with my <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> band, then I can go back home when I want, listening <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>notices</i><c>news</c></NS> about what <NS type="TV"><i>happens</i><c>has happened</c></NS> around the world <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>the radio of my car</i><c>my car radio</c></NS>. So I have <NS type="R"><i>must</i><c>many</c></NS> more <NS type="IJ"><i>interestings</i><c>interesting</c></NS> things to do in my life.</p>
<p>But the most important innovation <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>technology</i><c>technological</c></NS> development is the computer. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>everytime</i><c>every time</c></NS> of the day I can communicate with people of all <NS type="AGN"><i>nationality</i><c>nationalities</c></NS> of the world, I can <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> about everything, I can buy something which I can't find in the shops <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my town, so I can do anything just <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> clicking on the mouse!</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the stage. <NS type="AGA"><i>She</i><c>He</c></NS> is my <NS type="RJ"><i>famous</i><c>favourite</c></NS> artist and I <NS type="TV"><i>was <NS type="RV"><i>coming</i><c>going</c></NS></i><c>went</c></NS> there mainly because of him. <NS type="UC"><i>If this</i><c>This</c></NS> made me really disappointed - he wasn't <NS type="RV"><i>playing</i><c>performing</c></NS> there.</p>
<p>In the advertisement, it <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>said</c></NS> that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really <NS type="S"><i>dissapointing</i><c>disappointing</c></NS>. I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> him.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i>on</i><c>On</c></NS> the other hand, because of <NS type="RV"><i>dealing with</i><c>being on</c></NS> computers so much, I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> see my family and friends very much, even when we are <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the same <NS type="RN"><i>medium</i><c>place</c></NS>. It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker. But despite this, I am very happy with the <NS type="W"><i>facilities <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>technology</i><c>technological</c></NS></i><c>technological facilities</c></NS> in my daily life.</p>
<p>Recently I visited an arts festival<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of <NS type="U"><i>its creation</i></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is great. However, I have some proposals <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> its <NS type="DN"><i>improving</i><c>improvement</c></NS> next year.</p>
<p>And, <NS type="RY"><i>at last</i><c>finally</c></NS>, I should congratulate you <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the decision <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>making</i><c>to make</c></NS></i><c>to have</c></NS> one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is <NS type="S"><i>convinient</i><c>convenient</c></NS> both for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>people</i><c>public</c></NS> and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>organisators</i><c>organisers</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>the</c></NS> festival next year.</p>
<p>Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice <NS type="M"></NS>. The things you wrote about in your letter are quite <NS type="RJ"><i>common</i><c>familiar</c></NS> for me, because we, <NS type="RY"><i>actually</i><c>at the moment</c></NS>, have some problems <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> our rules.</p>
<p>I'm really fed up with our school <NS type="S"><i>forne</i><c>uniform</c></NS>! It is <NS type="DJ"><i>awfull</i><c>awful</c></NS>! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. <NS type="RT"><i>Off</i><c>Of</c></NS> course, if we had <NS type="RD"><i>such</i><c>a</c></NS> pretty <NS type="S"><i>forne</i><c>uniform</c></NS> like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment.</p>
<p>What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital <NS type="S"><i>equipement</i><c>equipment</c></NS>. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> will be a <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>remedium</i><c>remedy</c></NS></i><c>cure</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>for</c></NS> AIDs or cancer soon.</p>
<p>Firstly, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I have some holidays during <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month. I am working the rest of this summer.</p>
<p>You also asked me about two activities. I choose singing because I love singing and I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> in a choir for 7 years now. I also choose climbing. Unfortunately I am not so good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it. But I would take the opportunity to improve <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> students, but <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> full price.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I <NS type="RV"><i>will</i><c>want to</c></NS> say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California <NS type="UY"><i>already</i></NS>. I have never been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> California <NS type="RY"><i>yet</i><c>before</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am <NS type="X"><i>not <NS type="RJ"><i>well</i><c>good</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> both activities</i><c>not good at either activity</c></NS>, but it will be a pleasure to try <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>espacially</i><c>especially</c></NS> surfing<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I would like to feel the <NS type="RN"><i>air</i><c>wind</c></NS> in my hair, and enjoy how <NS type="RY"><i>quick</i><c>quickly</c></NS> the board goes over the sea.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In the other hand</i><c>On the other hand</c></NS> it is not as important, the main reason is I really look forward to <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> this <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS> and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> one more time, thanks a lot!</p>
<p>I <NS type="W"><i>only can travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July</i><c>can travel in July only</c></NS> because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the <NS type="S"><i>mounth</i><c>month</c></NS> he can give me <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS>, so I hope <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> isn't a problem for you.</p>
<p>I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> a refund <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed.</p>
<p>I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail <NS type="RT"><i>through</i><c>via</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> and the person <NS type="TV"><i>received</i><c>receives</c></NS> it within seconds.</p>
<p>I am really <NS type="SX"><i>made</i><c>mad</c></NS> and I want my money back<NS type="RP"><i>, please</i><c>. Please</c></NS> call me <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the number 23456789, I will be waiting <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> your call. Thank <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> for your time</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle Theatre. When I saw the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see "Over the Rainbow", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about <NS type="AGA"><i>that</i><c>them</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, when I bought the tickets I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>got</c></NS> no discount, and in the advertisement it was <NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>stated</c></NS> that people would <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> some, and when I got <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the <NS type="S"><i>beggining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes. Besides, I would <NS type="S"><i>preffer</i><c>prefer</c></NS> to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>, because I got used to being in tents since <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RQ"><i>each</i><c>every</c></NS> summer I <NS type="TV"><i>spent</i><c>spend</c></NS> my holidays</i><c>I spend my holidays every summer</c></NS> with my friends <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the hills.</p>
<p>AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED <NS type="RT"><i>ON</i><c>IN</c></NS> THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS. <NS type="RV"><i>I'VE</i><c>I WAS</c></NS> NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS.</p>
<p>SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY <NS type="TV"><i>ARE</i><c>HAVE BEEN</c></NS> DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> JUST <NS type="RT"><i>AS</i><c>FOR</c></NS> EXAMPLE, <NS type="MD"><c>THE</c></NS> INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS TECHNOLOGY <NS type="TV"><i>CHANGED</i><c>HAS CHANGED</c></NS> OUR <NS type="AGN"><i>LIFE</i><c>LIVES</c></NS> IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT.</p>
<p>But when I stand <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>outside</c></NS> every <NS type="AGN"><i>shops</i><c>shop</c></NS>, I can't <NS type="RV"><i>stand</i><c>resist</c></NS> my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> why I'm so poor. But I can get over <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. I go window shopping. <NS type="S"><i>Insead</i><c>Instead</c></NS> of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try <NS type="RQ"><i>every</i><c>all</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and <NS type="S"><i>jakect</i><c>jackets</c></NS> on. They are mine!</p>
<p>When I was at the <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>Univercity</i><c>University</c></NS></i><c>university</c></NS> I was very keen on <NS type="RP"><i>basket ball</i><c>basketball</c></NS> and I <NS type="TV"><i>was playing</i><c>played</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>Univercity's</i><c>University's</c></NS></i><c>university</c></NS> team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National <NS type="S"><i>Leque</i><c>League</c></NS>. Also I am <NS type="W"><i>a quite</i><c>quite a</c></NS> good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to <NS type="RV"><i>join</i><c>take part in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball</i><c>basketball</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Swimming</i><c>swimming</c></NS> activities while I am at the <NS type="RP"><i>Camp</i><c>camp</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Modern technology <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="RV"><i>granted</i><c>created</c></NS></i><c>has created</c></NS> other <NS type="RN"><i>facilities</i><c>conveniences</c></NS>: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> a big queue to be attended by the <NS type="DN"><i>cashman</i><c>teller</c></NS>, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.</p>
<p>I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really <NS type="TV"><i>wanted</i><c>want</c></NS> to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> could give <NS type="RA"><i>us</i><c>me</c></NS> a lesson <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> the Camp. Also, I would like to join <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> basketball team<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> won many competitions during <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> last ten years in our city. I am glad I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> taken <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team.</p>
<p>It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your place.</p>
<p>First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>as</c></NS> my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times.</p>
<p>First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The <NS type="RJ"><i>music</i><c>musical</c></NS> instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> flesh.</p>
<p>So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> because she trusted in him<NS type="RP"><i>;</i><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>immediatly</i><c>immediately</c></NS> he <NS type="RV"><i>came</i><c>went</c></NS> to see one of his <NS type="AGN"><i>friend</i><c>friends</c></NS> to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> her class knew about what she had <NS type="W"><i>just said</i><c>said just</c></NS> the day before to Pat.</p>
<p>So <NS type="DY"><i>immediatly</i><c>immediately</c></NS> she went <NS type="RT"><i>towards</i><c>to</c></NS> Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up.</p>
<p>All of us want to go <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we <NS type="W"><i>all would</i><c>would all</c></NS> like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m.<NS type="UP"><i>, it</i><c> It</c></NS> <NS type="R">is about</NS> the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles<NS type="RP"><i>, all</i><c>. All</c></NS> of us are really <NS type="RJ"><i>interesting</i><c>interested</c></NS>, and it is free for <NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> there. So <NS type="RV"><i>may</i><c>would</c></NS> you please <NS type="RV"><i>change</i><c>reschedule</c></NS> the visit <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the Science Museum <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was two years ago<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="L"><i>me and my classmates</i><c>my classmates and I</c></NS></i><c>. My classmates and I</c></NS> went <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> a leadership trip <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. This trip was organised by our form tutor<NS type="RP"><i>, he</i><c>. He</c></NS> wanted to test <NS type="UA"><i>us</i></NS> if we <NS type="TV"><i>trust</i><c>trusted</c></NS> each other and worked in a team, and the trip <NS type="TV"><i>last</i><c>lasted</c></NS> for 3 days. The first days <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>going</i></NS> fine<NS type="RP"><i>, we</i><c>. We</c></NS> just had to do some teamwork things.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>On</c></NS> the second day, we had to climb up a <NS type="DJ"><i>twenty metres</i><c>twenty-metre</c></NS> hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>had been</c></NS> really scared to stand <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and <NS type="DY"><i>careful</i><c>carefully</c></NS>, and I climbed about 15 metres quite <NS type="DY"><i>success</i><c>successfully</c></NS>, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right <NS type="AGN"><i>feet</i><c>foot</c></NS> slipped <NS type="UY"><i>over</i></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> nearly fell <NS type="UY"><i>down</i></NS>, but <NS type="DY"><i>luckly</i><c>luckily</c></NS> my hand caught a rock<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> was dangerous, but I didn't <NS type="FV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> any choice<NS type="RP"><i>, finally</i><c>. Finally</c></NS> I did it.</p>
<p>I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had <NS type="TV"><i>been sold</i><c>sold</c></NS> out. I could not understand why but <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>after</c></NS> waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so <NS type="DY"><i>bad</i><c>badly</c></NS> that I left the theatre before it finished. <NS type="RY"><i>At last</i><c>Last</c></NS>, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning.</p>
<p>A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS>. However, they are <NS type="DY"><i>equal</i><c>equally</c></NS> important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so <NS type="RJ"><i>shameful</i><c>ashamed</c></NS> that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>in</c></NS> a loud voice. 'If there were no <NS type="AGN"><i>cleaner</i><c>cleaners</c></NS>, who would clean the school for us<NS type="RP"><i>, who</i><c>? Who</c></NS> would keep the environment nice and tidy<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS>' Suddenly, all <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>my</c></NS> classmates applauded and smiled <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> jobs have the same importance.'</p>
<p>Being on <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> holiday <NS type="UN"><i>trip</i></NS> in London, I dreamed <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> to the theatre <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "It is that one that I want to try."</p>
<p>There were no discount <NS type="RN"><i>places</i><c>seats</c></NS> because it was not <NS type="IV"><i>planed</i><c>planned</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>like <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> by the theatre</i><c>by the theatre like that</c></NS>. What was written <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement?</p>
<p>I was terribly <NS type="S"><i>ennoyed</i><c>annoyed</c></NS>! I spent the <NS type="FJ"><i>worse</i><c>worst</c></NS> evening of my holiday <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> this show!</p>
<p>So I <NS type="W"><i>need now</i><c>now need</c></NS> a "perfect - <NS type="DN"><i>money back</i><c>refund</c></NS> -" <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> replacement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> your "perfect evening out".</p>
<p>"How has modern technology changed your daily life?" First of all, "daily life" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. <NS type="R"><i>Up to</i><c>As recently as</c></NS> two years ago, I was working with a <NS type="RN"><i>written booknote</i><c>notebook</c></NS> or <NS type="RN"><i>agenda</i><c>diary</c></NS>, and I used to <NS type="RV"><i>phone</i><c>use</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> a wired phone system. <NS type="S"><i>Nowaday</i><c>Nowadays</c></NS>, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that <NS type="RV"><i>authorizes</i><c>allows</c></NS> me to connect to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> and electronic <NS type="CN"><i>mails</i><c>mail</c></NS>. I am always <NS type="RJ"><i>joinable</i><c>available</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> my mobile phone, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is also <NS type="W"><i>sometimes boring</i><c>boring sometimes</c></NS>! Being <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> an apprenticeship, I go <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> both work and university. At the university, I have <NS type="RV"><i>learned</i><c>studied</c></NS> with <NS type="MP"><i>computer aided</i><c>computer-aided</c></NS> systems. I often go on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet to find <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>when</c></NS> studying a <NS type="RJ"><i>precise</i><c>particular</c></NS> subject more <NS type="RY"><i><NS type="S"><i>accutely</i><c>accurately</c></NS></i><c>closely</c></NS> (university technology sites). At work my <NS type="RJ"><i>personal</i><c>particular</c></NS> job <NS type="RV"><i>uses</i><c>involves</c></NS> two standard <NS type="AGN"><i>PC</i><c>PCs</c></NS> with <NS type="DJ"><i>specifical</i><c>specific</c></NS> <NS type="CN"><i>softwares</i><c>software</c></NS> plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a <NS type="RJ"><i>particular</i><c>special</c></NS> computer that my firm is <NS type="W"><i><NS type="IV"><i>developping</i><c>developing</c></NS> now</i><c>now developing</c></NS>. At home, I have got a personal computer for my <NS type="CN"><i>mails</i><c>mail</c></NS> and accounts, and electronic mail plus <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> for keeping <NS type="RV"><i>connected to</i><c>in touch with</c></NS> my friends <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>who</c></NS> are <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the other <NS type="RN"><i>end</i><c>side</c></NS> of France or Germany, Korea and so on. So modern technology has totally changed my daily life!</p>
<p>Firstly, the most suitable month would be <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> July because I am very busy <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> my work now, and my children are <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> holiday then.</p>
<p>The activities are really interesting and I would take part <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> Painting and Climbing. I am not very good <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> painting, but I <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>choose</c></NS> it because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is a good <NS type="S"><i>oportunity</i><c>opportunity</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="DV"><i>practice</i><c>practise</c></NS></i><c>do</c></NS> it. Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body. I don't want to <NS type="S"><i>dissapoint</i><c>disappoint</c></NS> you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges.</p>
<p>Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, <NS type="W"><i>brother of Catherine</i><c>Catherine's brother</c></NS>, <NS type="IV"><i>hatted</i><c>hated</c></NS> Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> he sent Heathcliff to work <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the farm. In the <NS type="RP"><i>mean time</i><c>meantime</c></NS> Catherine <NS type="RV"><i>knew</i><c>met</c></NS> Edgar Linton and <NS type="RY"><i>at the end</i><c>in the end</c></NS> she married Edgar because of <NS type="MD"><c>he</c></NS> money and good education.</p>
<p>Thank you <NS type="R"><i>a lot</i><c>very much</c></NS> for your kind letter. I was very surprised <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the result of the competition. Now I am happy to give you all the information you need.</p>
<p>I think it would be better for me to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. I will <NS type="TV"><i>started</i><c>start</c></NS> an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave <NS type="MY"><c>then</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In your letter you ask me to choose <NS type="S"><i>beetween</i><c>between</c></NS> tents or log cabins<NS type="RP"><i>, well</i><c>.  Well</c></NS> I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> and I am afraid <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> wild animals. I saw<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> you offer a lot of activities<NS type="RP"><i>, that'is</i><c>.  That's</c></NS> fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like <NS type="MY"><c>most</c></NS> and I can also do <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> best. I think I <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>will choose</c></NS> singing because I have sung for five years in a church <NS type="RN"><i>chorus</i><c>choir</c></NS> and I do it very well. The other activity I like very <NS type="S"><i>muche</i><c>much</c></NS> is swimming. I <NS type="TV"><i>took</i><c>have taken</c></NS> part <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a lot of competitions.</p>
<p>Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> your adventure <NS type="CE">or experience you had in last time</NS>.</p>
<p>We would like to <NS type="RV"><i>request</i><c>ask</c></NS> if we could go to this show on the 15th March <NS type="S"><i>instide</i><c>instead</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>off</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>doing</c></NS> the visit <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the Science Museum. We could <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>this one</i><c>that</c></NS> on the Wednesday<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> 15th March<NS type="M"><c>, in the</c></NS> afternoon.</p>
<p>Thank you <NS type="DY"><i>in advanced</i><c>in advance</c></NS> for your <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>comprehention</i><c>comprehension</c></NS></i><c>understanding</c></NS> and we look forward to hearing <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>from</c></NS> you.</p>
<p>I went to London last week for business and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> loving <NS type="W"><i>very much theatre</i><c>theatre very much</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I had promised my friend to <NS type="RV"><i>offer</i><c>give</c></NS> her, after work, a very good evening <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> your musical show: "Over the Rainbow".</p>
<p>But Pat could not keep it <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>very</c></NS> long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told <NS type="RP"><i>an other</i><c>another</c></NS> friend our <NS type="RN"><i>story</i><c>secret</c></NS>. What a <NS type="S"><i>catestrophee</i><c>catastrophe</c></NS>! All <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> children <NS type="RV"><i>went</i><c>left</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>from</i></NS> the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>with</c></NS> Pat. Our <NS type="RN"><i>quietness</i><c>peace</c></NS> disappeared and very <NS type="RY"><i>fast</i><c>soon</c></NS> everybody wanted to command my ship. A <NS type="S"><i>desaster</i><c>disaster</c></NS>!</p>
<p>I would be really happy if I could <NS type="RV"><i>apply</i><c>choose</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Singing</i><c>singing</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Photography</i><c>photography</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>from</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> activities you have <NS type="RV"><i>written about</i><c>listed</c></NS>. Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5. I could say that I am quite good at it. <NS type="RY"><i>However</i><c>Also</c></NS>, I used to assist my brother, who is a <NS type="S"><i>profecional</i><c>professional</c></NS> photographer<NS type="RP"><i>. So</i><c>, so</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>that,</i></NS> I consider myself <NS type="W"><i><NS type="S"><i>expirienced</i><c>experienced</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>enough</i><c>fairly</c></NS></i><c>fairly experienced</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> this evening it started at 20.15. The <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.</p>
<p>But I think <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> my generation <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>there</c></NS> is not a really big difference<NS type="RP"><i>. In</i><c>, in</c></NS> comparison to my grandparents <NS type="RA"><i>they</i><c>who</c></NS> have <NS type="DJ"><i>really</i><c>real</c></NS> problems <NS type="FV"><i>to accept</i><c>accepting</c></NS> these changes in modern technology. Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for this <NS type="RN"><i>occasion</i><c>opportunity</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS> I'd like to travel only in July, because, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank. The second reason is the weather. I love travelling when the weather is warm. <NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>, because <NS type="W"><i>for me and my <NS type="MA"><i>family's</i><c>family it is</c></NS> more comfortable</i><c>it is more comfortable for me and my family</c></NS>. I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>.</p>
<p>The concert was absolutely fantastic. I was so glad, because <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>ending</i><c>end</c></NS> of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> show the singer kissed me and dedicated <NS type="W"><i>to me a lovely song</i><c>a lovely song to me</c></NS>. Can you <NS type="S"><i>immagine</i><c>imagine</c></NS>? <NS type="RP"><i>Ok</i><c>OK</c></NS>, write <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me soon, huge hug and kisses</p>
<p>1. First of all, I was really furious <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> watching a show starring <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> a different actor, instead of Danny Brook<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> whose name was <NS type="RV"><i>stated</i><c>given</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than <NS type="UA"><i>what</i></NS> it was <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>meant</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>start</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>With</i><c>Considering</c></NS> all the above points, I would like to ask for some money <NS type="R"><i>return</i><c>back</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> consider <NS type="FV"><i>to <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS></i><c>taking</c></NS> this <NS type="DN"><i>complains</i><c>complaint</c></NS> to <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> court if I do not receive <NS type="RD"><i>any</i><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>agreeable</i><c>acceptable</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>explaination</i><c>explanation</c></NS> from the theatre. Thank You.</p>
<p>The future is <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> hope and <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> dream for everyone <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the earth. Therefore, I will suggest that we all <NS type="DV">nov</NS> to keep the <NS type="S"><i>enviroment</i><c>environment</c></NS> clean and healthy for the next generation.</p>
<p>After having thought about this video and asked <NS type="RJ"><i>different</i><c>various</c></NS> people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> a great part <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> a day at school; this being in three parts.</p>
<p>That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> students come <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>class</i><c>classroom</c></NS>. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who <NS type="TV"><i>makes</i><c>made</c></NS> the film. Furthermore, as <NS type="RP"><i>Mathematics</i><c>mathematics</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> a time <NS type="RC"><i>where</i><c>when</c></NS> we are in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>MathClass</i><c>maths class.</c></NS></p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Like</i><c>As</c></NS> I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre <NS type="S"><i>publis</i><c>publicised</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not <NS type="MY"><c>there</c></NS>, which was very disappointing because<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> the actors <NS type="UV"><i>were</i></NS> starring <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the musical<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> one of <NS type="DD"><i>it</i><c>its</c></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>mayor</i><c>major</c></NS> attractions. Another point that I want to <NS type="RV"><i>comply</i><c>complain</c></NS> about<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="SX"><i>mayor</i><c>major</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>unsatisfaction</i><c>dissatisfaction</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS>, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> your food <NS type="UV"><i>was</i></NS> unhealthy, and <NS type="M"><c>I am</c></NS> not <NS type="RV"><i>considering</i><c>taking into consideration</c></NS> many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>In consequence of</i><c>For</c></NS> the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best.</p>
<p>Science and Technology is a theme very <NS type="MY"><c>much</c></NS> discussed <NS type="S"><i>nowdays</i><c>nowadays</c></NS>, most of the <NS type="S"><i>comunity</i><c>community</c></NS> of our city, and of the world, <NS type="SX"><i>were</i><c>where</c></NS> technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life. And I think it's the same <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me, because when advances in technology<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like computers, <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, etc.<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> were made, it changed my life as a high school student.</p>
<p><NS type="FV"><i>Answering</i><c>To answer</c></NS> the question: "How has modern technology changed my daily life?<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS>, I can confirm<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, because it was <NS type="FJ"><i>easiest</i><c>easier</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me, and <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>every one</i><c>everyone</c></NS>, to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> your <NS type="CN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>home works</i><c>homeworks</c></NS></i><c>homework</c></NS>, <NS type="UN"><i>school works</i></NS>, and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in fact, it was easier <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me to search for information that in the past I would have to look <NS type="RY"><i>at</i><c>up</c></NS> in a library. But not <NS type="RA"><i>all</i><c>everything</c></NS> about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a <NS type="RJ">control</NS> way, <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> become <NS type="RP"><i>computer's</i><c>computers'</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>an</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>thechnologic's</i><c>technology's</c></NS> slaves, and we <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make <NS type="W"><i>easier our daily tasks</i><c>our daily tasks easier</c></NS>, but we have to <NS type="S"><i>mantain</i><c>maintain</c></NS> our independence as humans.</p>
<p>Technology, in fact<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> has <NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>meant</c></NS> an improvement <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>regarding</c></NS> daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our <NS type="AGN"><i>brain</i><c>brains</c></NS> will become atrophied.</p>
<p>These days, there are so many people <NS type="MA"><c>who</c></NS> like shopping that it is one of the important <NS type="AGN"><i>part</i><c>parts</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> our life. It is not, however, always enjoyable <NS type="RC"><i>that</i><c>and</c></NS> there are both advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>To sum up, shopping is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> find only advantages <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>to</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>About accommodation, I would prefer <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS>, because I have a problem <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not <NS type="RY"><i>fairly</i><c>very</c></NS> comfortable.</p>
<p>The most suitable time for me is <NS type="S"><i>Jule</i><c>July</c></NS> because in August I intend to go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the countryside, where I have a small farm. In September my school starts a new study year. So, because of that I can only <NS type="MV"></NS> then.</p>
<p>You'd like to know how <NS type="W"><i>was the Top-Pop Concert</i><c>the Top-Pop Concert was</c></NS>, which I helped to organise last month. It was <NS type="S"><i>absolutlly</i><c>absolutely</c></NS> great! I was responsible <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> security of one of the sectors. I gave information about correct ways to <NS type="AGD"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> places like <NS type="S"><i>tooletes</i><c>toilets</c></NS> and medical points. I was also asked about <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, <NS type="IN"><i>knifes</i><c>knives</c></NS> and so on in bags. Although I worked I watched the concert. <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>It</c></NS> was <NS type="RJ"><i>big</i><c>great</c></NS> fun! People danced, screamed and <NS type="TV"><i>sung</i><c>sang</c></NS> with <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> singer. I looked very carefully at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> organisation of the event, you know I'm <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>interestsing</i><c>interesting</c></NS></i><c>interested</c></NS> in it.</p>
<p>I was so <NS type="DJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>suprise</i><c>surprise</c></NS></i><c>surprised</c></NS> to hear from you. I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the competition. I'm so happy because it is the first time that I <NS type="TV"><i>win</i><c>have won</c></NS> something.</p>
<p>Here <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is all your information. I would like <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> if <NS type="RA"><i>you</i><c>I</c></NS> could <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>have</c></NS> my vacation <NS type="UN"><i>trip</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the only time of the year that my <NS type="RN"><i>job</i><c>employer</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>will</c></NS> let me have a vacation. As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> first time that <NS type="TV"><i>I'm going</i><c>I've been</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> camping and I would like to see <NS type="R">how the real life is</NS>. I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities <NS type="RY"><i>also</i><c>as well</c></NS>. I would like to choose swimming and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> climbing. I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing<NS type="MP"><i> that's</i><c>. That's</c></NS> why I <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>chose</c></NS> it because I want to try something <NS type="SX"><i>knew</i><c>new</c></NS>. <NS type="RY"><i>At last</i><c>Finally</c></NS> I would like to ask you about my clothes and <NS type="AS"><i>how the weather is going to be</i><c>what the weather is going to be like</c></NS> and what kind of clothes I must <NS type="FV"><i>to take</i><c>take</c></NS> with me. That is all.</p>
<p>As I mentioned <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you before<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Friend</i><c>friend</c></NS> of mine<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>she</i></NS> is a stage assistant and she needed <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> that pop concert last month.</p>
<p>The waterfall <NS type="TV"><i>made</i><c>was made</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>from</c></NS> real rock so that was the worst bit because <NS type="AG"><i>they were</i><c>it was</c></NS> really heavy and we had to carry <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS>, but <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the end of <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>moth</i><c>month</c></NS> when the concert started, it was all over.</p>
<p>Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> some variety of <NS type="RN">features</NS> <NS type="R"><i>in it</i><c>there</c></NS>. Next, <NS type="RP"><i>One</i><c>one</c></NS> reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>that</c></NS> ticket.</p>
<p>However, according to my notes, there are some <NS type="FN"><i>doubt</i><c>doubts</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were <NS type="W"><i>from only six countries in fact</i><c>in fact only from six countries</c></NS>. The number of plays and films <NS type="AGV"><i>were</i><c>was</c></NS> also very <NS type="RJ"><i>few</i><c>small</c></NS>. In addition to that some concert halls were too small <NS type="M"><c>for the audience</c></NS> to enjoy the concerts.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>With regard to</c></NS> your letter, I am writing to <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="S"><i>infrom</i><c>inform</c></NS></i><c>give</c></NS> you <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> the information you need to know <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>trip</i><c>stay of</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>I am very excited and looking forward to the new <NS type="S"><i>experiance</i><c>experience</c></NS> I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have <NS type="RP"><i>freetime</i><c>free time</c></NS> in July <NS type="MP"><c>-</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> any day, any week<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c> -</c></NS> because I am still having my <NS type="FN"><i>lesson</i><c>lessons</c></NS> at college and <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>they</c></NS> will be finished at the end of June<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>atmosephere</i><c>atmosphere</c></NS> of camping, but I wouldn't mind <NS type="FV"><i>to stay</i><c>staying</c></NS> in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>do</c></NS> swimming and Basketball. I have always found these <NS type="AGN"><i>kind</i><c>kinds</c></NS> of activity make me <NS type="RV"><i>fell</i><c>feel</c></NS> strong and <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> enjoy doing <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>both</c></NS> up till now. I <NS type="TV"><i>also <NS type="UV"><i>used</i></NS> to be</i><c>was also</c></NS> in a basketball team in school for 3 years.</p>
<p>The aim of this report is <NS type="FV"><i><NS type="S"><i>describ</i><c>describe</c></NS></i><c>to describe</c></NS> and assess <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>lesson</i><c>lessons</c></NS> and activities should be filmed <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> a short video. It is <NS type="DJ"><i>base</i><c>based</c></NS> on information made <NS type="S"><i>availble</i><c>available</c></NS> by <NS type="FN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> from each class at school.</p>
<p>Most <NS type="AGN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> who were interviewed suggested <NS type="FV"><i>to have</i><c>having</c></NS> a speaking part <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the lesson <NS type="M"><c>that is</c></NS> to be on film. It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because <NS type="AGN"><i>student</i><c>students</c></NS> always make some <NS type="FN"><i>mistake</i><c>mistakes</c></NS> while they are practising with <NS type="S"><i>thier</i><c>their</c></NS> partner, in spite of <NS type="TV"><i>having told</i><c>having been told</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> teacher ten times. It <NS type="TV"><i>felt</i><c>was felt</c></NS> to be a good memory to be <NS type="RV"><i>remember</i><c>reminded</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i>remind</i><c>to remind</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>our <NS type="S"><i>sleves</i><c>selves</c></NS></i><c>ourselves</c></NS></i><c>us</c></NS> to speak in a correct way. This lesson will <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>help</c></NS> us to be relaxed and have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> laugh. We also would like to have a history <NS type="SX"><i>on</i><c>one</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> is the month <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> I could <NS type="FY"><i>more</i><c>most</c></NS> likely have off <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> work <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>going</i><c>to go</c></NS> on holiday.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would prefer to stay <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> rather than <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS>. That is because<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I do not want to seem <NS type="S"><i>fuzy</i><c>fussy</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> but I like to have some <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>comodities</i><c>commodities</c></NS></i><c>luxuries</c></NS> when I am going on holiday and I think <NS type="S"><i>slepping</i><c>sleeping</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>over</i><c>on</c></NS> the floor without electricity <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> may annoy me.</p>
<p><NS type="ID">On the other hand,</NS> I would like to know some <NS type="S"><i>imformation</i><c>information</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> could be useful <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my holiday like: <NS type="RQ"><i>which</i><c>what</c></NS> type of clothes <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> else? If <NS type="UV"><i>is</i></NS> so, please let me know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to tell you about my experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>last month pop concert</i><c>pop concert last month</c></NS>, where I was helping my friend Nick<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> who was the bouncer <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>venue</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>That</i><c>It</c></NS> was a charity concert to <NS type="RV"><i>save</i><c>raise</c></NS> money <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> poor people <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> AFRICA.</p>
<p>I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it was very <NS type="SX"><i>cleaver</i><c>clever</c></NS> of me to record that moment <NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS> I will never ever forget, and that was the <NS type="SX"><i>think</i><c>thing</c></NS> that I <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RY"><i>more</i><c>most</c></NS> liked</i><c>liked most</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> that experience.</p>
<p>First of all, I <NS type="X"><i>think it's not</i><c>don't think it's</c></NS> professional to change the principal actor <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the last minute, the play should <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> with Danny Brook, but it wasn't.</p>
<p>And <NS type="TV"><i>it's not ending</i><c>it has not ended</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I hope that <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> my thirties I'll go to Mars on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS>...</p>
<p>That is everything I have <NS type="RV"><i>noticed</i><c>thought of</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>concerning</c></NS> the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it.</p>
<p>Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>their</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>skirt</i><c>skirts</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>by</i></NS> 5 cm <NS type="RT"><i>under</i><c>below</c></NS> their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't <NS type="RV"><i>bother</i><c>interfere with</c></NS> studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning!</p>
<p>I am writing to give you <NS type="S"><i>futher</i><c>further</c></NS> information about me which you need <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> Camp California.</p>
<p>Concerning <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it because I have attended a relevant course for three months.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>According to</i><c>Because of</c></NS> my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity.</p>
<p>I am afraid I can only make it <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July.</p>
<p>As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>concerning</c></NS> this short video. I found that most of them <NS type="TV"><i>had suggested</i><c>suggested</c></NS> that four lessons should be filmed<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> as follow:</p>
<p>I'm not really sure <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> what kind of clothes to take<NS type="RP"><i>, could</i><c>. Could</c></NS> you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot.</p>
<p>It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the party. All the students wanted to organise a surprise party for Mr Brown. Next Tuesday is his birthday. We would like you to come and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> if you can<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> to help us <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> an important decision.</p>
<p>Secondly, the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>College Canteen</i><c>college canteen</c></NS>. We think <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> suitable time will be 3-6 p.m. You can come earlier, if you want. We would have <NS type="DN"><i>junky food</i><c>junk food</c></NS>, some juices and drinks. Moreover, <NS type="W"><i>will come some <NS type="AGN"><i>teacher</i><c>teachers</c></NS></i><c>some teachers will come</c></NS>, of course all the students and the Principal.</p>
<p>Please try to come and help us <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> this problem. We <NS type="S"><i>ar</i><c>are</c></NS> looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>Then we had an idea! We would have <NS type="RQ"><i>much</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> money from the work. At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia. We imagine that <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be the best <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> our life.</p>
<p>First of all, we <NS type="MV"><c>are</c></NS> happy to <NS type="MV"><c>have</c></NS> won the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your competition. Thank you for <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>choosing</c></NS> our ticket <NS type="R">at the final</NS>.</p>
<p>We <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, because my wife Catrin <NS type="R">just have holidays next month</NS>. We <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer the last two weeks <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. Would that be fine for you too?</p>
<p>It would be great if we <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="DV"><i>choosen</i><c>choose</c></NS> swimming and <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS>. My wife Catrin is a local <NS type="RN"><i>master</i><c>champion</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> swimming <NS type="FN"><i>race</i><c>races</c></NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>Im</i><c>I'm</c></NS> not so good as her, but <NS type="TV"><i>I'm going</i><c>I go</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>every week once</i><c>once every week</c></NS> to her training <NS type="MN"><c>session</c></NS>. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Golf</i><c>golf</c></NS>, we are both total beginners. We have no experience but we <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> like to learn this game.</p>
<p>We are both a little <NS type="RJ"><i>afraid</i><c>worried</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, what</i><c>.  What</c></NS> kind of clothes and shoes <NS type="MV"><c>do</c></NS> we have to take <NS type="UY"><i>off</i></NS> with us? <NS type="R"><i>Which temperature will be</i><c>What will the temperature be</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the summer season in this area? <NS type="AGV"><i>Are</i><c>Is</c></NS> there <NS type="RQ"><i>some</i><c>any</c></NS> possibility <NS type="M"><c>we could</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to rent</i><c>rent</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>golfshoes</i><c>golf shoes</c></NS>?</p>
<p>You are <NS type="S"><i>interessted</i><c>interested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> my last job! I really <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>want</c></NS> to tell you all <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> my experience.</p>
<p>However, I'm happy that we <NS type="TV"><i>finished</i><c>have finished</c></NS> this hard work. I worked in a team <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>of</c></NS> seven people. We were mainly <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>working</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> all the lights at this great concert. <NS type="DA"><i>Its</i><c>It</c></NS> sounds easy, just <NS type="R"><i>for</i><c>doing</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>light</i><c>lighting</c></NS>.</p>
<p>In addition, it was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> nine days <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> hard work to mount all the different spot and <NS type="S"><i>houndreds</i><c>hundreds</c></NS> of Coblights <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the right place.</p>
<p>Finally, we <NS type="TV"><i>had worked</i><c>worked</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>hohl</i><c>whole</c></NS> night <NS type="S"><i>befor</i><c>before</c></NS> the concert. We had to adjust the laser <NS type="DY"><i>extremly</i><c>extremely</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>carefully</c></NS>  <NS type="R"><i>on</i><c>to get it in</c></NS> the correct position. We spent hours <NS type="M"><c>on this</c></NS> till it was good enough for the <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>Technical-manger</i><c>Technical-manager</c></NS></i><c>technical manager</c></NS>. Moreover, the band was exhausted <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>by</c></NS> this great laser show <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the end.</p>
<p>Have you ever spent more money than you <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>should</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>during</c></NS> a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. <NS type="MP"><i>Its</i><c>It's</c></NS> normal to have spending sprees. Everyone <NS type="MV"><c>has</c></NS> had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid.</p>
<p>Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially <NS type="R"><i>to</i><c>not</c></NS> the press. Pat obviously couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>help being</i><c>keep</c></NS> silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the <NS type="DJ"><i>scandalistic</i><c>scandal-mongering</c></NS> press, not knowing that Paul had made up <NS type="RJ"><i>all the</i><c>the whole</c></NS> story! On Sunday all the <NS type="RP"><i>english</i><c>English</c></NS> press <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>invention</i><c>hoax</c></NS>, they got so angry that they wrote <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!!</p>
<p>My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>at</c></NS> the Circle theatre.</p>
<p>I would like to travel only in July, because in June I have to study at school<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="TV"><i>hasn't finished</i><c>doesn't finish</c></NS> until the end of June. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>For</c></NS> August, I have already made another appointment with my friends. We are going to visit the places of interest <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> China<NS type="RP"><i>, as</i><c>. As</c></NS> usual, our new term begins in September. I <NS type="W"><i>only can</i><c>can only</c></NS> travel in July</p>
<p>The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and <NS type="RN">lessons</NS> <NS type="MV"><c>should</c></NS> be filmed <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>for</c></NS> a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class.</p>
<p>With this letter I want to <NS type="RV"><i>show</i><c>explain</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you some problems I had last week <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre with your show. First of all, I want to introduce myself. I'm Francesco Schein, I'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show "Over the Rainbow". I was very upset because the show had many problems.</p>
<p>Now, I will answer your <NS type="RN"><i>requests</i><c>questions</c></NS>. In reference <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>to</c></NS> the date of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> University and I only have July to take my holidays.</p>
<p>About camp activities<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I would prefer to do basketball and photography. I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> these activities because <NS type="RY"><i>actually</i><c>these days</c></NS> I am playing <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> university team, and photography is my <NS type="S"><i>favoorate</i><c>favourite</c></NS> hobby. I have recently bought a new camera.</p>
<p>My duties <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> a <NS type="RN"><i>organization</i><c>staff</c></NS> member were <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>diferent</i><c>different</c></NS></i><c>various</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>firts</i><c>first</c></NS> day I had to pick the bands up <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>from</c></NS> the airport, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> for <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>this</c></NS> I hired a van. The following day I was the person who <NS type="TV"><i>provide</i><c>provided</c></NS> the meals for all the <NS type="UN"><i>organization</i></NS> staff and <NS type="RY"><i>besides</i><c>also</c></NS> every day I was <NS type="U"><i>at the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>back-stage</i><c>backstage</c></NS> supporting the catering staff.</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but <NS type="RC"><i>when</i><c>then</c></NS> I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the <NS type="W"><i>performance at 19:30</i><c>19:30 performance</c></NS> but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the musical. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>Now I am planning to be a good photographer. I will use some photographs to put <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS> website<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that belongs <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS> magazine, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="R">I had projected. last year</NS>.</p>
<p>. How much money would <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> like to pay me for <NS type="W"><i>five hours a day <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> two weeks working with children</i><c>working with children for five hours a day for two weeks</c></NS>?</p>
<p>Last month, I <NS type="TV"><i>work</i><c>worked</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> roadie at <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> Rolling Stones <NS type="RP"><i>Pop Concert</i><c>pop concert</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I was <NS type="S"><i>responsable</i><c>responsible</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> sound <NS type="U"><i>that comes from the stage</i></NS>. Now, I have some experience <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to produce</i><c>producing</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>CDs <NS type="RJ"><i>alive</i><c>live</c></NS></i><c>live DCs</c></NS> of famous <NS type="AGN"><i>band</i><c>bands</c></NS>, <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>I</c></NS> would like to do it. I hope <NS type="UY"><i>so</i></NS> to be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> producer of shows, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I have chosen photography and climbing <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> activities. I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS>. I have a medium level <NS type="M"><c>of proficiency</c></NS> in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains.</p>
<p>I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring, I booked the ticket <NS type="S"><i>imagetly</i><c>immediately</c></NS>. But, instead there was a different actor, who I <NS type="TV"><i>never heard</i><c>had never heard</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> before!</p>
<p>But the <NS type="RN"><i>discovery</i><c>invention</c></NS> that I'm most thankful <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> is the <NS type="S"><i>computor</i><c>computer</c></NS> and the Internet! Thanks to <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>them</c></NS>, I can <NS type="DY"><i>easy</i><c>easily</c></NS> communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England. It's so quick and not too expensive either. To use the mobile phone<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> by the way, is very expensive. I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends.</p>
<p>It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the <NS type="DN"><i>leader of it</i><c>singer</c></NS> fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and <NS type="S"><i>wistling</i><c>whistling</c></NS> for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the <NS type="RN"><i>leader</i><c>singer</c></NS>, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. <NS type="RT"><i>Like</i><c>About</c></NS> an hour later, he recovered and the show began.</p>
<p>She really <NS type="TV"><i>listen</i><c>listened</c></NS> to me and told me that I <NS type="TV"><i>did</i><c>was doing</c></NS> the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> language course in England.</p>
<p>Choosing only two activities <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>from</c></NS> such a <NS type="L"><i>bunch</i><c>variety</c></NS> of interesting ones was quite hard, but I decided to <NS type="RV"><i>take</i><c>pick</c></NS> the two I've never tried, <NS type="RP"><i>Climbing and Surfing</i><c>climbing and surfing</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RV"><i>Excuse</i><c>Forgive</c></NS> me for the long time I left you without any news. I wrote <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you last time that I was going to <NS type="ID"><i>give a hand</i><c>lend a hand</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the installation and preparation of "Garbage's" concert and you asked me to tell you how it <NS type="TV"><i>has been</i><c>was</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing in reply to your letter, which I <NS type="TV"><i>have received</i><c>received</c></NS> last week, and in fact I am very surprised and <NS type="DJ"><i>please</i><c>pleased</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the prize.</p>
<p>Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a <NS type="RJ"><i>long</i><c>log</c></NS> cabin, <NS type="R"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> I used to use <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> tent on holiday and I haven't <NS type="R">got very good experiences</NS>.</p>
<p>In addition, I work every summer as a <NS type="RN">Monitor</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the leisure centre in my town.</p>
<p>Once, when we first met<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time <NS type="M"><c>we had finished</c></NS> we found out <NS type="M"><c>that we had formed</c></NS> a very good friendship <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>through</c></NS> our conversation.</p>
<p>The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> kissing. People <NS type="TV"><i>would be</i><c>were</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>starring</i><c>staring</c></NS> at me and laughing.</p>
<p>I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've <NS type="W"><i>planned already</i><c>already planned</c></NS> the rest of my summer holidays. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there.</p>
<p>I am replying to your letter <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> the first prize <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the competition<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that I won and there are a number of <NS type="SX"><i>thinks</i><c>things</c></NS> I would like to make clear.</p>
<p>I must say that being <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert is very nice. But helping <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> need is co-operation and <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>don't</i><c>mustn't</c></NS> think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big <NS type="RN">stress</NS> about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> this job is that you have to deal with huge <NS type="RN"><i>amounts</i><c>numbers</c></NS> of people. There were 963 <NS type="L"><i>persons</i><c>people</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the "<NS type="S"><i>Armaggedon</i><c>Armageddon</c></NS>" that night!</p>
<p>How are you? I'm fine<NS type="MP"><i> soon</i><c>. Soon</c></NS> I'll have my holiday and I look forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>that</c></NS> but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot.</p>
<p>Now I want to tell you about a pop concert<NS type="MP"><i> as</i><c>. As</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>have already <NS type="IV"><i>knowen</i><c>known</c></NS></i><c>already know</c></NS> I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some <NS type="CN"><i>advices</i><c>advice</c></NS> about suits and dresses. Often we <NS type="RV"><i>looked</i><c>saw</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>repetitions</i><c>rehearsals</c></NS> and if something didn't <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>appeal to</c></NS> us we tried to correct it. The most <NS type="DJ"><i>enjoable</i><c>enjoyable</c></NS> thing was to <NS type="DV"><i>smart</i><c>dress</c></NS> people. We have a good and rich sponsor<NS type="RP"><i>, that's</i><c>. That's</c></NS> why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that <NS type="RN"><i>part</i><c>piece</c></NS> of <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothing</c></NS> which we thought was <NS type="FJ"><i>more <NS type="RJ"><i>similar</i><c>suitable</c></NS></i><c>most suitable</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> their style. We always explained <NS type="M"><c>things to</c></NS> them and <NS type="ID"><i>at the end</i><c>in the end</c></NS> they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how <NS type="RY"><i>loud</i><c>loudly</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> audience <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>claped</i><c>clapped</c></NS></i><c>applauded</c></NS> them we were proud and understood that we <NS type="R">spent a good time</NS>. You should try it and <NS type="RV"><i>feel</i><c>see</c></NS>. I'll be waiting for your answer.</p>
<p>I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to you to complain about the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> that I saw when I went to the theatre <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> my holidays in London.</p>
<p>Most young people <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> Carol believe the same and use their minds to <NS type="S"><i>imagin</i><c>imagine</c></NS> the variety of clothes in the future. After <NS type="R"><i>wear</i><c>all</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> they'll be the ones that <NS type="S"><i>dicide</i><c>decide</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>How</i><c>what</c></NS> the Fashion of the Future will be like.</p>
<p>I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have. <NS type="RT"><i>From</i><c>In</c></NS> August, <NS type="U"><i>in fact</i></NS>, I will start <NS type="UC"><i>with</i></NS> a new job and I will not be able to <NS type="RV"><i>live</i><c>leave</c></NS> Rome for a long <NS type="RN"><i>period</i><c>time</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>of</c></NS> different shops, <NS type="FV"><i>try</i><c>trying</c></NS> on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> back home with dozens of bags in your hands.</p>
<p>I have recently been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London for <NS type="UV"><i>spending</i></NS> a week's holiday. As I am <NS type="FD"><i>an</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>enthusiasmic</i><c>enthusiast</c></NS></i><c>fan</c></NS> of musicals I went to see this <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed because the things that were <NS type="IV"><i>writen</i><c>written</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> were not really true.</p>
<p>It was <NS type="W"><i><NS type="IV"><i>writen</i><c>written</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>also</c></NS></i><c>also written</c></NS> that there were discounts available and I asked <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> them and they said <NS type="UA"><i>me</i></NS> that they weren't <NS type="TV"><i>allow</i><c>allowed</c></NS> to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>give</c></NS> any discount. After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>On one hand</i><c>On the one hand</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day.</p>
<p>If it's possible I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because of my job. I can't leave it until <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> year.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>About</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin. It would be <NS type="FJ"><i>nice and safe</i><c>nicer and safer</c></NS> for me than the tents. The activities I would like to choose <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>are</c></NS> swimming and sailing. It could be fun for me because I like swimming<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and sailing could be exciting too.</p>
<p>In the following <NS type="S"><i>paragraps</i><c>paragraphs</c></NS> I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> shopping.</p>
<p>Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> with the intention <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to give</i><c>giving</c></NS> you an impression of our experiences <NS type="RV"><i>visiting</i><c>attending</c></NS> the <NS type="MP"><i>above mentioned</i><c>above-mentioned</c></NS> show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an <NS type="DN"><i>apologation</i><c>apology</c></NS>. We had been told that discounts <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="UP"><i>ticket-prices</i><c>ticket prices</c></NS> were <NS type="RJ"><i>possible</i><c>available</c></NS> but <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was - to our surprise - closed because of the <NS type="UN"><i>time</i></NS> delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that "perfect evening out". We would like to ask you if there is any chance <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to get</i><c>getting</c></NS> our money back <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> or if you can offer any other alternative <NS type="R">for our convenience</NS>? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> July only <NS type="RP"><i>Because</i><c>because</c></NS> I'll be free for the whole month. So any date <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> July. I'd like to <NS type="DV"><i>accommodation</i><c>stay</c></NS> at Camp California in tents<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> like to sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent when <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> go camping. Also I would like to choose the two activities <NS type="AS"><i>that you <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>gave</i><c>given</c></NS> me on the list</i><c>from the list that you have given me</c></NS>. I would like to choose Swimming and Photography. I'm good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> swimming. I used to swim for the school team. But I <NS type="TV"><i>never do</i><c>have never done</c></NS> photography before. I love to take <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>photo</i><c>photos</c></NS> but never have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> chance to do so. But I have <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> chance to choose.</p>
<p>That's all <NS type="RP"><i>i</i><c>I</c></NS> did <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the pop concert for my <NS type="RN">experience</NS>. What about your experience? Don't forget to tell me about yours<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> okay... Better go to sleep now. Bye</p>
<p>I'm <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to you to thank you for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RJ"><i>good</i><c>excellent</c></NS> programme <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> our English class in London, especially for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> river trip to Greenwich<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> will be a great experience for us. But the students in our class have seen an <NS type="S"><i>adverstisement</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show"<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>which'll</i><c>which will</c></NS> take place in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="UC"><i>and</i></NS> at</i><c>. At</c></NS> the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show. It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends. There is one more advantage: it is free for students. So we would like to suggest <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> how the programme could be changed.</p>
<p>First of all I want to <NS type="ID"><i>congratulate your cousin <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> fifteenth birthday</i><c>wish your cousin a happy fifteenth birthday</c></NS> and <NS type="SX"><i>with</i><c>wish</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>her</c></NS> all the best. I hope that it will be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good holiday for her, her family and friends.</p>
<p>Now about your questions, it is very difficult for me to give any advice <NS type="UA"><i>you</i></NS> about it<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I don't know your cousin very well so I don't know what she prefers reading. But when I was fifteen my favourite book <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> "<NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie". So I can <NS type="FV"><i>recommended</i><c>recommend</c></NS> you <NS type="FV"><i>to <NS type="RV"><i>present</i><c>give</c></NS></i><c>give</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>her</c></NS> this book, because it is <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very interesting, <NS type="DJ"><i>amuse</i><c>amusing</c></NS>, sometimes dramatic and <NS type="DJ"><i>mystery</i><c>mysterious</c></NS> book. This book <NS type="AGV"><i>help</i><c>helps</c></NS> us to <NS type="S"><i>impove</i><c>improve</c></NS> our <NS type="RN">logic</NS>, mind, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, <NS type="FV"><i>be</i><c>to be</c></NS> more honest with other people and pay attention <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> the smallest details in our life because sometimes <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> can help us very very much.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about your musical show "Over the Rainbow". Last week I was on holiday <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> London and I was very <NS type="S"><i>dissappointed</i><c>disappointed</c></NS> when I visited your theatre.</p>
<p>Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>on</c></NS> the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there <NS type="AGV"><i>was not</i><c>weren't</c></NS> any.</p>
<p>I would like to book my tickets <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> the beginning of July. The 3rd of July will suit <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> me.</p>
<p>I would like to choose surfing <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> my second <NS type="AGN"><i>activities</i><c>activity</c></NS>. I've never done it before. I'd like to get some lessons if it's possible. I've seen how people do it but I've never tried it <NS type="R"><i>my own</i><c>myself</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Maybe you will spend all your money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> night-club but you <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>will be</c></NS> short of money. Some people will do crazy things in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed <NS type="RT"><i>due to</i><c>for</c></NS> redecoration!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had <NS type="RY"><i>already</i><c>soon</c></NS> heard <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation.</p>
<p>This was the kind of association everybody knew <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that <NS type="RV"><i>telling</i><c>talking</c></NS> aloud about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards.</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I am very glad <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> my first place in the competition<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I am going to tell you <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> the things that you ask me <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your letter.</p>
<p>I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is the perfect time to go to the camp and <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is summer.</p>
<p>Furthermore<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I <NS type="IV"><i>haves</i><c>have</c></NS> been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>capitan</i><c>captain</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It wasn't very exciting <NS type="RN"><i>job</i><c>work</c></NS> but you <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>knew</i><c>know</c></NS></i><c>meet</c></NS> a lot of pop Artists<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> was the good thing <NS type="M"><c>about it</c></NS> because they gave <NS type="MY"><c>away</c></NS> their <NS type="RP"><i>t-shirts</i><c>T-shirts</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> also I could chat with them for a few minutes. <NS type="RP"><i>another</i><c>Another</c></NS> good thing was that all the people <NS type="TV"><i>wants</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to be in your place and they were very jealous <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>of</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>In your letter you <NS type="RV"><i>settled</i><c>presented</c></NS> the possibility <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to choose</i><c>choosing</c></NS> two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in with</c></NS> basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them <NS type="RC"><i>due to</i><c>because</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>I've played</i><c>I played</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>basketball</c></NS> in my secondary <NS type="S"><i>scholl</i><c>school</c></NS> as <NS type="RN"><i>leader</i><c>captain</c></NS> of <NS type="R"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> team and due to my long training <NS type="RN"><i>periods</i><c>sessions</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> lifting weights.</p>
<p>Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear <NS type="UY"><i>with</i></NS> the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>on</c></NS> their territory.</p>
<p>There is<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> as well<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> the crowds<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>crambled</i><c>crammed</c></NS> in the small shops during the <NS type="RJ"><i>unique</i><c>only</c></NS> day-off you have to buy <NS type="S"><i>somthing</i><c>something</c></NS> you like. All this can easily <NS type="AGV"><i>leads</i><c>lead</c></NS> to a <NS type="DN"><i>nerve-collapse</i><c>nervous breakdown</c></NS>, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way <NS type="RT"><i>across</i><c>through</c></NS> the crowds or while you were <NS type="S"><i>qeuing</i><c>queuing</c></NS> to pay. If this wasn't enough <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> despite having been <NS type="RV"><i>stolen</i><c>robbed</c></NS>, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you finally buy something you really <NS type="TV"><i>liked</i><c>like</c></NS> with your credit card and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> after having walked a few blocks<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you see the same item at half <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> price in another shop.</p>
<p>I'm the winner of the first prize in your <NS type="S"><i>competion</i><c>competition</c></NS> and I'm writing to you to give <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> some information which was <NS type="RV"><i>required</i><c>requested</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>by</c></NS> you.</p>
<p>If I can choose <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> accommodation I <NS type="MV"><c>would</c></NS> prefer <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log <NS type="AGN"><i>cabins</i><c>cabin</c></NS>, because when I've been <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="RP"><i>Camps</i><c>camps</c></NS></i><c>campsites</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>before</c></NS>, it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation.</p>
<p>It's really difficult <NS type="FV"><i>choose</i><c>to choose</c></NS> two activities from that list. <NS type="RP"><i>Everyone</i><c>Every one</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> very interesting. Anyway, I think <NS type="RP"><i>Basketball</i><c>basketball</c></NS> could be the right <NS type="MN"><c>choice</c></NS> because it's the sport that <NS type="TV"><i>I'm</i><c>I've been</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>practising</i><c>playing</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>since</c></NS> I was a child<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and photography because it's my hobby <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> my free time<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>I'm</i><c>I</c></NS> really enjoy it and I can say I'm <NS type="RY">so</NS> good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it.</p>
<p>Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours <NS type="UV"><i>going</i></NS> shopping and not find what you <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>are</c></NS> looking for, perhaps because it is not <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms<NS type="M"><c>, where you</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>waiting</i><c>wait</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>stand</i><c>standing</c></NS> up for your turn. After that, <NS type="M"><c>there is</c></NS> the unfriendly and <NS type="UP"><i>sometime's</i><c>sometimes</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>unpolite</i><c>impolite</c></NS> shop <NS type="RN"><i>assistance</i><c>assistant</c></NS> who <NS type="RV"><i>breaks</i><c>gets on</c></NS> your nerves <NS type="UY"><i>down</i></NS>. But never mind! <NS type="RP"><i>the</i><c>The</c></NS> worst <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>arrive</i><c>arrives</c></NS></i><c>is</c></NS> when you get <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> home in the evening and find a chair to sit <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> because your feet are killing you and <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> realize you have spent all <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> this letter to <NS type="S"><i>informe</i><c>inform</c></NS> you about the decisions I have made <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>regarding</c></NS> your questions.</p>
<p>First of all I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July because I will <NS type="UA"><i>I</i></NS> have finished my exams by the end of June. I will not be able to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August because I have found a job for that month.</p>
<p><NS type="RP"><i><NS type="S"><i>asketball</i><c>basketball</c></NS></i><c>Basketball</c></NS> and swimming are the two activities I have chosen. I <NS type="TV"><i>play</i><c>have played</c></NS> basketball since I was twelve years old and I <NS type="TV"><i>am</i><c>have been</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> member of the <NS type="W"><i>basketball school</i><c>school basketball</c></NS> team for four years. In swimming I <NS type="TV"><i>had won</i><c>won</c></NS> the first <NS type="RN"><i>price</i><c>prize</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> a local competition.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the problems <NS type="M"></NS> <NS type="U"><i>were exist</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> musical show.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Except <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS></i><c>Apart from</c></NS> this<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> there <NS type="MV"><c>is</c></NS> more. After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> because the chef of the restaurant was ill. This is not an excuse.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day Brian, <NS type="W"><i>the best friend of Pat</i><c>Pat's best friend</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> told him a secret. <NS type="M"><i>An</i><c>It was an</c></NS> important secret for Brian. He told him<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>the best friend of Jane</i><c>Jane's best friend</c></NS>. He didn't <NS type="FV"><i>told</i><c>tell</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>her</c></NS> the secret because he wanted to <NS type="SX"><i>heard</i><c>hurt</c></NS> Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="DJ"><i>shame</i><c>ashamed</c></NS></i><c>embarrassed</c></NS> to ask Jane <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> date.</p>
<p>When Pat <NS type="IV"><i>heart</i><c>heard</c></NS> the good news he told <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Brian to <NS type="FV"><i>asked</i><c>ask</c></NS> her <NS type="MY"><c>out</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> date and he knew that she <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>accepted</i><c>accept</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> that evening.</p>
<p>In the first place, when <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people think only <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>to the</i></NS> shopping <NS type="MA"><c>they</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>forget</c></NS> <NS type="IQ"><i>others</i><c>other</c></NS> things: <NS type="FV"><i>play</i><c>playing</c></NS> with their children, <NS type="FV"><i>talk</i><c>talking</c></NS> with <NS type="SX"><i>than</i><c>their</c></NS> parents, friends.</p>
<p>Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre. We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor, but we <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>seems</i><c>seemed</c></NS></i><c>were</c></NS> quite <NS type="RJ"><i>disappointing</i><c>disappointed</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, my</i><c>. My</c></NS> son was very happy because he would see <NS type="W"><i>for the first time his <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> actor</i><c>his favourite actor for the first time</c></NS>. However<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it's</i><c>that's</c></NS> just the <NS type="S"><i>begining</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of the problems we had. Expecting <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>britan</i><c>British</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>pontuality</i><c>punctuality</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we went to the theatre at 19:00 to <NS type="S"><i>wath</i><c>watch</c></NS> the 19:30 <NS type="RN"><i>section</i><c>show</c></NS> but it only <NS type="TV"><i>starts</i><c>started</c></NS> at 20:15<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>. It</c></NS> finished later than it was <NS type="S"><i>suposed</i><c>supposed</c></NS> to and then we missed the train. I <NS type="TV"><i>haven't seen</i><c>didn't see</c></NS> any discounts available<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> I <NS type="SX"><i>though</i><c>thought</c></NS> my son would <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>payed</i><c>paid</c></NS></i><c>have paid</c></NS> less than I. As we had <NS type="S"><i>alredy</i><c>already</c></NS> missed the first <NS type="MN"></NS> we went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the theatre restaurant<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is famous for <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>its</c></NS> good food, however<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was closed.</p>
<p><NS type="ID"><i>In spite of</i><c>Because of</c></NS> this, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="FJ"><i>less</i><c>least</c></NS> you can do for us is to give <NS type="MA"><c>me</c></NS> my money back and work hard so that this <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>which</c></NS> is <NS type="S"><i>famouis</i><c>famous</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> its beauty and <NS type="S"><i>pontuality</i><c>punctuality</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> become famous <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>it</i><c>its</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>desorganized</i><c>disorganised</c></NS> shows.</p>
<p>People have seen in the last 10 years how <NS type="S"><i>diferent</i><c>different</c></NS> our clothes <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>can</c></NS> become <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS>. Clothes <NS type="UA"><i>that</i></NS> used to be made of <NS type="S"><i>coton</i><c>cotton</c></NS>, but nowadays we can see shirts, pants<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> socks....made of almost <NS type="RA"><i>everything</i><c>anything</c></NS>. It is a revolution in <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> fashion that is starting now. Nowadays we have <NS type="DV">drifit</NS> a kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our <NS type="AGN"><i>body</i><c>bodies</c></NS> <NS type="M"></NS>, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> clothes that don't get wet or even dirty. Computers <NS type="R"><i>that make some</i><c>are</c></NS> little things <NS type="U"><i>for us</i></NS> nowadays, but at the speed at <NS type="MA"><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>tecnology</i><c>technology</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>goes</i><c>develops</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the next century <NS type="UD"><i>those</i></NS> clothes will tell our doctors <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> our <NS type="S"><i>healt</i><c>health</c></NS> at any moment, any time, <NS type="RP"><i>any where</i><c>anywhere</c></NS>, people will be able to locate us <NS type="S"><i>arround</i><c>around</c></NS> the world. In the future we won't <NS type="SX"><i>by</i><c>buy</c></NS> clothes <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>according to</c></NS> size or even <NS type="SA"><i>color</i><c>colour</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>, our</i><c>. Our</c></NS> clothes will adapt to our <NS type="AGN"><i>body</i><c>bodies</c></NS>, the weather, our <NS type="RN">fit</NS> <NS type="UC"><i>so</i></NS>, <NS type="MQ"><c>all</c></NS> our <NS type="RN"><i>necessities</i><c>needs</c></NS>. It <NS type="TV"><i>already started</i><c>has already started</c></NS> and <NS type="X"><i>don't have</i><c>has no</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>limites</i><c>limits</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>to go</i></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="ID">On the contrary</NS>, I'm an absolute beginner <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> playing tennis and I'm not fit <NS type="MY"><c>enough</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>for</c></NS> running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time.</p>
<p>And if this is a problem <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) <NS type="RV"><i>should</i><c>would</c></NS> feel.</p>
<p>Often they must go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> special shops to <NS type="SX"><i>by</i><c>buy</c></NS> their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life.</p>
<p>First of all, the reason that we decided to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>have</c></NS> this party was because Mr Brown helped <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the organisation of our trip to France. And we <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="S"><i>preciate</i><c>appreciate</c></NS></i><c>would appreciate</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to not tell</i><c>not telling</c></NS> him about our party.</p>
<p>Secondly, the party <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> is on Tuesday 16th <NS type="RY"><i>pm</i><c>in the evening</c></NS> at the <NS type="RP"><i>College Canteen</i><c>college canteen</c></NS>. As <NS type="RV"><i>concerned</i><c>regards</c></NS> the food, our mothers <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> will help <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> that. Also, <NS type="W"><i>the drinks we will take</i><c>we will take the drinks</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>them</i></NS> from our canteen and there will be a group of <NS type="S"><i>mucisians</i><c>musicians</c></NS> for our entertainment.</p>
<p>Moreover, <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the party <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> will <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> come of course all the class, our teachers and the Principal <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> our school</i><c>all the class, our teachers and the Principal will come to the party of course</c></NS>. Finally, I would like to ask you about our present. <NS type="W"><i>We should</i><c>Should we</c></NS> buy a book or a <NS type="RP"><i>Cd player.</i><c>CD-player?</c></NS></p>
<p>I hope that <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>to have</i><c>have</c></NS> been of some help <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> the party. I look forward to seeing you there.</p>
<p>All <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> night I did not <NS type="TV"><i>sleeping</i><c>sleep</c></NS> at all. I was <NS type="W"><i><NS type="R"><i>draw</i><c>by</c></NS> 6:30 <NS type="UP"><i>p.m</i><c>pm</c></NS> in the <NS type="RN"><i>company</i><c>office</c></NS></i><c>in the office by 6.30 pm</c></NS>. The executive <NS type="TV"><i>calls</i><c>called</c></NS> me <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>into</c></NS> the office, and he <NS type="TV"><i>has <NS type="TV"><i>show</i><c>shown</c></NS></i><c>showed</c></NS> me my office.</p>
<p>From, that day, every day I <NS type="TV"><i>was gone</i><c>went</c></NS> to the office 30 minutes <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>early</c></NS>. When I <NS type="TV"><i>complete</i><c>completed</c></NS> a month <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> this job my executive <NS type="UA"><i>he</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>tell</i><c>told</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> John to go to the office. I was <NS type="S"><i>surpised</i><c>surprised</c></NS> because I did not know what he wanted. When I went <NS type="DA"><i>his</i><c>he</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>wants</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to tell me that from the next month I <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be his personal <NS type="S"><i>secratary</i><c>secretary</c></NS> and my salary <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="DY"><i>the double</i><c>twice</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="M"><c>it was</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="DY"><i>previous</i><c>previously</c></NS>. I <NS type="TV"><i>cannot</i><c>could not</c></NS> believe it.</p>
<p>I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> your theatre<NS type="UP"><i>. With</i><c> with</c></NS> a friend<NS type="MP"><i> we</i><c>. We</c></NS> had seen your advertisement for the show, <NS type="SX"><i>witch</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>was</i><c>made it seem</c></NS> very attractive.</p>
<p>The <NS type="DN"><i>starring</i><c>star</c></NS> had been changed, the show had started <NS type="UY"><i>only</i></NS> at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for <NS type="R"><i>some working inside</i><c>renovation</c></NS>. And your last <NS type="DN"><i>phrasal</i><c>phrase</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement <NS type="MV"><c>was</c></NS> "Your perfect evening out"! <NS type="RP"><i>it</i><c>It</c></NS> wasn't <NS type="MA"><c>that</c></NS> at all, <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> I have <NS type="TV"><i>explain</i><c>explained</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you above in this letter.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>At the</i><c>When I</c></NS> began <NS type="U"><i>of my</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>working</c></NS> in <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> Insurance Company, I had only <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> old <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> machine</i><c>typewriter</c></NS>, <NS type="SX"><i>witch</i><c>which</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>makes</i><c>made</c></NS> a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> because the <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>switch</i><c>switches</c></NS></i><c>buttons</c></NS> were hard <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, <NS type="SX"><i>witch</i><c>which</c></NS> is very easy to use, and <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> for my fingers <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> also <NS type="IJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>more farrster</i><c>more faster</c></NS></i><c>faster</c></NS>. But <NS type="S"><i>wen</i><c>when</c></NS> the computer <NS type="AGV"><i>don't</i><c>doesn't</c></NS> work, I <NS type="RV"><i>got</i><c>have</c></NS> a big problem <NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>doing</c></NS> my work.</p>
<p>Also now <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="FV"><i>write</i><c>to write</c></NS> a letter to a friend <NS type="RJ"><i>overland</i><c>overseas</c></NS> it is better <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>to use</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet</i><c>it is better to use the Internet to write a letter to a friend overseas</c></NS>. It is so practical, in five <NS type="S"><i>minuts</i><c>minutes</c></NS> my friend can read my letter. And he can <NS type="S"><i>ansewer</i><c>answer</c></NS> me very quickly. I think<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it is now the <NS type="S"><i>futur</i><c>future</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> big <NS type="AGN"><i>company</i><c>companies</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>work</i><c>to work</c></NS> with the Internet.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an <NS type="DY"><i>absolute</i><c>absolutely</c></NS> new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled.</p>
<p><NS type="UY"><i>Especially</i></NS> I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>Then the concert started, I was called <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>by</c></NS> one of the <NS type="IN"><i>staffs</i><c>staff</c></NS> for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next <NS type="RN"><i>work</i><c>task</c></NS> I was <NS type="TV"><i>gives</i><c>given</c></NS> was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore?</p>
<p>I am <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to inform <NS type="M"><c>you of</c></NS> some problems we had. I <NS type="RV"><i>want</i><c>went</c></NS> to the theatre to see "<NS type="RP"><i>over the rainbow</i><c>Over The Rainbow</c></NS>" <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> 17th June.</p>
<p>First of all, we went to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> ticket office to get the tickets. I thought we <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> buy discounts tickets <NS type="RT"><i>according to</i><c>because of</c></NS> the advertisement. However, we couldn't <NS type="R">buy them the price</NS>. <NS type="RP"><i>eventually</i><c>Eventually</c></NS>, we got the tickets, <NS type="RP"><i>Because</i><c>because</c></NS> we <NS type="TV"><i>would <NS type="RV"><i>like</i><c>want</c></NS></i><c>wanted</c></NS> to see the musical and Danny Brook. <NS type="R"><i>After</i><c>When</c></NS> we <NS type="TV"><i>arrive</i><c>arrived</c></NS> at the theatre, <NS type="RP"><i>We</i><c>we</c></NS> were very disappointed<NS type="RP"><i>. Because</i><c>, because</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> different actor <NS type="RV"><i>played</i><c>performed</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the musical that day. In addition, <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> started <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> 20:15. We had to wait over 40 <NS type="S"><i>minitues</i><c>minutes</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> and we couldn't enjoy dinner at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> theatre restaurant after the show.</p>
<p>I have recently been on a holiday <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London. During my stay I went to see the musical "Over the Rainbow". Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed.</p>
<p>What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> that.</p>
<p>I gave it <NS type="R"><i>a</i><c>some</c></NS> thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>off</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>plastic-fabrics</i><c>plastic fabrics</c></NS>. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes.</p>
<p>I write this letter to you <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="FV"><i>explain</i><c>to explain</c></NS></i><c>to describe</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>my</i><c>the</c></NS> very bad evening I have <NS type="RV"><i>passed</i><c>had</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>your</c></NS> theatre. <NS type="RT"><i>On</i><c>In</c></NS> the paper it was <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS></i><c>written</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> the principal actor is "Danny Brook" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor <NS type="RA"><i>that</i><c>whom</c></NS> we <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> never seen, <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> heard. I think it's really not <NS type="RJ"><i>correct</i><c>right</c></NS>.</p>
<p>But <NS type="R"><i>it's</i><c>I am</c></NS> not <NS type="TV"><i>finish</i><c>finished</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you wrote <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the paper "Discounts available" but it wasn't true<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> it was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very badly <NS type="DV"><i>organisation</i><c>organised</c></NS>. After this bad show we had <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> to go to the Restaurant for <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>drunk</i><c>drink</c></NS> and <NS type="FV"><i>ate</i><c>to eat</c></NS> something and it was closed and nobody <NS type="TV"><i>had explained</i><c>explained</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> us why the Restaurant wasn't open.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this <NS type="S"><i>sentance</i><c>sentence</c></NS> is very popular in our school. Pat is not an <NS type="RJ">angry</NS> girl. She is very friendly but she can't keep a secret. Last year, on a Saturday evening<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> my boyfriend <NS type="TV"><i>phone</i><c>phoned</c></NS> me at 20 h <NS type="UN"><i>o'clock</i></NS> and said <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me, "Would you like to go to the cinema with me<NS type="MP"><c>.</c></NS>" I asked my parents but <NS type="SX"><i>the</i><c>they</c></NS> said <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "No<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school.<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> Then I <NS type="TV"><i>phone</i><c>phoned</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Pat <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>explain</i><c>to explain</c></NS> my big problem. Pat said to me<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "You <NS type="TV"><i>said</i><c>say</c></NS> to your parents that you <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> sleep <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>with</c></NS> me and you <NS type="RV"><i>don't</i><c>aren't</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS> to the cinema.<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> I asked my parents and they said<NS type="MP"><i> alright</i><c>, "Alright</c></NS> you can go to <NS type="MP"><i>Pat</i><c>Pat's</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>sleeping</i><c>to sleep</c></NS>.<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> I was very happy, I <NS type="TV"><i>phone</i><c>phoned</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> my boyfriend and I <NS type="RV"><i>explained</i><c>told</c></NS> him my secret<NS type="MP"><i> he</i><c>. He</c></NS> said<NS type="MP"><i> <NS type="S"><i>allright</i><c>alright</c></NS></i><c>, "Alright,</c></NS> so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema". I <NS type="RV"><i>passed</i><c>spent</c></NS> a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother <NS type="TV"><i>phone</i><c>phoned</c></NS> Pat's mother and Pat's mother <NS type="TV"><i>explain</i><c>explained</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RJ"><i>all</i><c>whole</c></NS> the</i><c>the whole</c></NS> story to my mother.

Since <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> Saturday evening I <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> never <NS type="TV"><i>speaking</i><c>spoken</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> Pat.</p>
<p>To answer your first question, I would like to travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>july</i><c>July</c></NS> if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at <NS type="RD"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS> time of the year.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS> at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, <NS type="RA"><i>he</i><c>which</c></NS> is going to be more <NS type="RJ"><i>funny</i><c>fun</c></NS>, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question.</p>
<p>I can see <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm <NS type="SX"><i>quiet</i><c>quite</c></NS> good<NS type="RP"><i>. </i><c>(</c></NS>I finished 5th <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the <NS type="DJ"><i>England</i><c>English</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>Golf <NS type="RN"><i>tour</i><c>tournament</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>junior</i><c>Junior</c></NS></i><c>Junior Golf Tournament</c></NS>  in 1999<NS type="MP"><c>)</c></NS>, and basketball, because I would like to <NS type="RV"><i>discover</i><c>rediscover</c></NS> this sport I only used to play at school.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the <NS type="S"><i>competiton</i><c>competition</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.</p>
<p>Last <NS type="RP"><i>saturday</i><c>Saturday</c></NS> evening I <NS type="RV"><i>spent</i><c>had</c></NS> a wonderful time. The <NS type="RP"><i>motor bike</i><c>motorbike</c></NS> club <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> our town organized a pop concert. A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment.</p>
<p>Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>I've entered</i><c>I'd entered</c></NS></i><c>I'd won</c></NS> a competition. I was so happy and <NS type="S"><i>suprised</i><c>surprised</c></NS> that <NS type="W"><i>I first</i><c>first I</c></NS> could not really believe it.  But it was true. My <NS type="RN"><i>price</i><c>prize</c></NS> was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>their</c></NS> concert. The pop group which was going to <NS type="RV"><i>act</i><c>play</c></NS> is called "Metallica" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to<NS type="RP"><i>.)</i><c>).</c></NS> But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. <NS type="RA"><i>I</i><c>It</c></NS> started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that <NS type="X"><i>I also was not able to eat anything</i><c>I was not able to eat anything either</c></NS>. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of <NS type="RJ"><i>guiding</i><c>guided</c></NS> tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I <NS type="RV"><i>recognised</i><c>realised</c></NS> that they <NS type="TV"><i>are</i><c>were</c></NS> very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I have to tell you, they <NS type="RV"><i>did</i><c>gave</c></NS> a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like <NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS>Did you like the performance<NS type="RP"><i>!</i><c>?"</c></NS> or <NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS><NS type="R"><i>How</i><c>What</c></NS> do you think about the first group?<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean<NS type="RP"><i>, they</i><c>.  They</c></NS> were not conceited or <NS type="RA"><i>something</i><c>anything</c></NS> like <NS type="RA"><i>this</i><c>that</c></NS>. They were like <NS type="UQ"><i>any</i></NS> other <NS type="L"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>person</i><c>persons</c></NS></i><c>people</c></NS> and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life.</p>
<p>Firstly, I <NS type="TV"><i>would</i><c>will</c></NS> be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, I would say I prefer living in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent rather than in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log cabin because I used to sleep in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tent <NS type="RC"><i>while</i><c>when</c></NS> I was <NS type="RV"><i>joining</i><c>staying</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have <NS type="IV"><i>choosen</i><c>chosen</c></NS> Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my <NS type="SA"><i>favorite</i><c>favourite</c></NS> hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would <NS type="MV"><c>like</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>ask</i><c>to ask</c></NS> you whether I have to prepare any <NS type="S"><i>speacial</i><c>special</c></NS> clothes for camping or <NS type="W"><i>the camp will</i><c>will the camp</c></NS> provide them for me.</p>
<p>I look forward to receiving the details <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>regarding</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>travelling</i><c>trip</c></NS> soon and <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> joining your camp in July.</p>
<p><NS type="RY"><i>Sometime</i><c>Sometimes</c></NS> shopping doesn't <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>do</c></NS> anything <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> you but <NS type="RY"><i>always</i><c>only</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>waste</i><c>wastes</c></NS> all your free time. A group of girls can <NS type="RV"><i>spend their time</i><c>stay</c></NS> in a shopping <NS type="SA"><i>center</i><c>centre</c></NS> forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping <NS type="IN"><i>complexs</i><c>complexes</c></NS> nowadays are more attractive and combine every <NS type="AGN"><i>facilities</i><c>facility</c></NS> inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy.</p>
<p>I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. <NS type="RT"><i>In</i><c>At</c></NS> that time I used the computer only to play <NS type="U"><i>with its</i></NS> video games.</p>
<p>I also would prefer to sleep <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS>  tents<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which are more comfortable<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> and, because I have been doing lots of <NS type="CN"><i>campings</i><c>camping</c></NS>, I am quite used to this kind of <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>.</p>
<p>We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by <NS type="AGQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>one</c></NS> at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it <NS type="W"><i>started actually</i><c>actually started</c></NS> at 20:15 due to <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>probleme</i><c>problem</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>with</c></NS> the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts <NS type="AGV"><i>wasn't</i><c>weren't</c></NS> available for us, because they didn't accept our student <NS type="S"><i>indentity</i><c>identity</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>card</i><c>cards</c></NS> from Switzerland.</p>
<p>Could you figure out how your life <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be without <NS type="U"><i>all the</i></NS> modern technology? What is the effect <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> it <NS type="MV"><c>has</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> your <NS type="S"><i>environement</i><c>environment</c></NS>? Were <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> people happier in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> past than <NS type="RP"><i>to day</i><c>today</c></NS>? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>in</c></NS> this article.</p>
<p>Nowadays, <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> technology takes <NS type="MY"><c>up</c></NS> a large <NS type="RN"><i>place</i><c>part</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> your daily life and improves the speed of <NS type="R">the achievement</NS>. For example at work, we look <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the computer screen all day, sending e-mail <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the other side of the world, doing some <NS type="RN"><i>searches</i><c>research</c></NS> etc. We gain a lot of time with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer, but if your computer <NS type="IV"><i>brooks</i><c>broke</c></NS> down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it.</p>
<p>The major <NS type="S"><i>probleme</i><c>problem</c></NS> for the <NS type="DJ"><i>industry</i><c>industrial</c></NS> cities is to deal with the bad <NS type="FN"><i>effect</i><c>effects</c></NS> of <NS type="S"><i>polution</i><c>pollution</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the <NS type="S"><i>environement</i><c>environment</c></NS>. A lot of money <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> involved in research to stop the <NS type="DN"><i>increasing</i><c>increase</c></NS> <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MN"><c>levels</c></NS> of <NS type="S"><i>polution</i><c>pollution</c></NS>.</p>
<p>To sum up, all the improvements <NS type="ID"><i>have a price to pay</i><c>come at a price</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>; The</i><c>: the</c></NS> condition of the <NS type="S"><i>environement</i><c>environment</c></NS>. We are too <NS type="RJ"><i>reliable</i><c>dependent</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>on</c></NS> technology today. But we can ask <NS type="RA"><i>us</i><c>ourselves</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "What will <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> happen in 50 years?<NS type="MP"><c>"</c></NS> Our children will be able to travel <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the moon as we travel to Japan?</p>
<p>When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>on the paper that was on the door was <NS type="IV"><i>writen</i><c>written</c></NS></i><c>was written on the paper that was on the door</c></NS>, it was too late.</p>
<p><NS type="MA"><i>All</i><c>It all</c></NS> started when she was fifteen, when <NS type="MA"><c>she</c></NS> started a new course <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the institute and met some girls that <NS type="R"><i>passed the</i><c>in</c></NS> time <NS type="UA"><i>they</i></NS> would <NS type="FV"><i>became</i><c>become</c></NS> her friends.</p>
<p>Three years passed and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> her friends knew a lot about her</p>
<p>She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> is <NS type="S"><i>usuall</i><c>usual</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> girls from the last course became popular.</p>
<p><NS type="R">If I pick up</NS> <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>an</c></NS> example, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Kimono (<NS type="W"><i>Japanese traditional</i><c>traditional Japanese</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothing</c></NS>) will <NS type="TV"><i>wear</i><c>be worn</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i><NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> not only</i><c>not only in</c></NS> Japan but also <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>another</i><c>other</c></NS> countries in <NS type="DN"><i>generally</i><c>general</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>Through</c></NS> one country's traditional <NS type="RN"><i>cloth</i><c>clothing</c></NS> <NS type="RV">taking in</NS> <NS type="R">those</NS> of another country, <NS type="R">it can born different type and new kind of fashion</NS>.</p>
<p>What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic <NS type="UJ"><i>artificial</i></NS> cloth in 2100. Of course, <NS type="RD"><i>those</i><c>these</c></NS> new <NS type="AGN"><i>material</i><c>materials</c></NS> won't be so harmful <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> our health as today's nylon and other things like that.</p>
<p>And it is even more <NS type="S"><i>difficul</i><c>difficult</c></NS> to predict <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> clothes <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the future will look like. People's  <NS type="RN"><i>fantasy</i><c>imaginations</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> enormous.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> which was <NS type="RV"><i>presented</i><c>performed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>at</c></NS> The Circle Theatre last week. I saw the performance and it was not <NS type="RT"><i>like</i><c>as</c></NS> it was <NS type="RV"><i>mentioned</i><c>described</c></NS> in the <NS type="S"><i>advertisent</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> I read in the local newspaper.</p>
<p>What was <NS type="S"><i>suposed</i><c>supposed</c></NS> to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time. So I would be <NS type="S"><i>greatful</i><c>grateful</c></NS> if you <NS type="IV"><i>payed</i><c>paid</c></NS> for a full refund of the money I spent <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets.</p>
<p>Computers, radio, <NS type="UP"><i>CD's</i><c>CDs</c></NS>, <NS type="S"><i>sattelite</i><c>satellite</c></NS> television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life. Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> my life, and it has some advantages as <NS type="M"><c>well as</c></NS> some disadvantages.</p>
<p>On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school. What I mean is that computers are very useful <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to do</i><c>doing</c></NS> my homework (like some <NS type="DN">monographies</NS> or <NS type="DN"><i>researching</i><c>research</c></NS>). And I can't even think <NS type="UT"><i>about</i></NS> <NS type="R"><i>how</i><c>what</c></NS> it would be <NS type="MT"><c>like</c></NS> not having a computer. Another <NS type="S"><i>advatage</i><c>advantage</c></NS> is that, for example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>sattelite</i><c>satellite</c></NS> television, which is an example of modern technology, <NS type="RV"><i>makes</i><c>keeps</c></NS> me <NS type="UV"><i>be</i></NS> informed about what is happening <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the whole world.</p>
<p>Next, students during the <NS type="RN"><i>pause</i><c>break</c></NS> in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>between</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>this</c></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> the classroom <NS type="S"><i>atmosphear</i><c>atmosphere</c></NS> but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video.</p>
<p>I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> <NS type="AGQ"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> things.</p>
<p>In music, before <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>having</i><c>had</c></NS> a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>in</c></NS> my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I <NS type="W"><i>just can</i><c>can just</c></NS> record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds.</p>
<p>I have happily received your reply <NS type="UN"><i>letter</i></NS> and I want to thank you for this <NS type="SA"><i>marvelous</i><c>marvellous</c></NS> prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only <NS type="RN"><i>period</i><c>month</c></NS> of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>provide</c></NS> me <NS type="R"><i>a</i><c>with</c></NS> good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity <NS type="RC"><i>and</i><c>or</c></NS> entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis <NS type="U"><i>for you</i></NS>. I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> it. <NS type="R"><i>At</i><c>As to</c></NS> tennis I'm the best player <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> my whole school and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> once, I got <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>into</c></NS> the top 10 of my <NS type="MP"><i>country</i><c>country's</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> tennis <NS type="MN"><c>players</c></NS>.</p>
<p>How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>onto</c></NS> the stage and<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and <NS type="IV"><i>shoke</i><c>shook</c></NS> our hands. I'll never wash my <NS type="FN"><i>hands</i><c>hand</c></NS> again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon.</p>
<p>I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't. It started at 20:15 leaving us <NS type="RV"><i>writing</i><c>waiting</c></NS> for <NS type="S"><i>fourty</i><c>forty</c></NS> five minutes. You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it. In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the show very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> cold winters' days.</p>
<p>As you can realise<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I think <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> future's clothes will be adjusted not <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> only <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>according to</c></NS> fashion and the seasons but <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the needs of every <NS type="R">on as to protect from the earths pollution as well</NS>.</p>
<p>With reference to the date, I <NS type="W"><i>only can</i><c>can only</c></NS> go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July, as I'm going off on holiday <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> August, and I start university <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> September. The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> than in a tent.</p>
<p>It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities. The ones I'm most keen on are <NS type="RP"><i>Tennis</i><c>tennis</c></NS>, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and <NS type="RP"><i>Painting</i><c>painting</c></NS>, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax <NS type="UA"><i>myself</i></NS> and forget about problems. I think I'm not bad at painting either<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> at least everyone in my family likes my work, <NS type="S"><i>includying</i><c>including</c></NS> myself.</p>
<p><NS type="W"><i>I want if it is possible</i><c>If it is possible I want</c></NS> a <NS type="AGN"><i>log cabins</i><c>log cabin</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>like</i><c>for my</c></NS> accommodation because I have been suffering <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>with</c></NS> my back since my childhood, therefore I need a <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>accommodation</i><c>place to sleep</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp. I selected swimming because it is a cure <NS type="RT"><i>against</i><c>for</c></NS> my <NS type="S"><i>backace</i><c>backache</c></NS> and I have not <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="SA"><i>practiced</i><c>practised</c></NS></i><c>done</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> since I started my new job five years ago. I also <NS type="IV"><i>choosed</i><c>chose</c></NS> painting because I have never done <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> before<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a <NS type="RJ"><i>calm</i><c>relaxing</c></NS> activity.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>in relation to</i><c>in connection with</c></NS> our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March. First <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>of</c></NS> all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> all of this <NS type="UN"><i><NS type="AGN"><i>things</i><c>thing</c></NS></i></NS> is the <NS type="RJ">impressionable</NS> introduction of the "new technologies", such as <NS type="RP"><i>Computers</i><c>computers</c></NS>, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet or WAP technologies.</p>
<p>Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without "touching" <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> others. It gets enormously unbearable <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out.</p>
<p>There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which <NS type="TV"><i>appear</i><c>appeared</c></NS> not long ago. Among them<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="S"><i>mashiens</i><c>machines</c></NS></i><c>appliances</c></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> kitchen, <NS type="S"><i>mashiens</i><c>machines</c></NS> which <NS type="AGV"><i>helps</i><c>help</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>housekeeper</i><c>housekeepers</c></NS> to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>greatly</c></NS> simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing <NS type="UY"><i>up</i></NS> dishes. They can <NS type="RY"><i>only</i><c>just</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>push</i><c>turn</c></NS> on their <NS type="DN"><i>dish <NS type="S"><i>mashiens</i><c>machines</c></NS></i><c>dishwashers</c></NS> and go to do something <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new <NS type="S"><i>morden</i><c>modern</c></NS> technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> daily life of people. Some years ago people<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> especially students<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> had to run to <NS type="S"><i>lubraries</i><c>libraries</c></NS> in order to find a book about something. But now they can use <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet, where you can find any information you need. <NS type="W"><i>Very often I use <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Internet</i><c>I use the Internet very often</c></NS>, and I must say it is very <NS type="S"><i>convienient</i><c>convenient</c></NS>. <NS type="UD"><i>The another</i><c>Another</c></NS> <NS type="MQ"><c>piece of</c></NS> modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone.</p>
<p>If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, <NS type="SX"><i>of</i><c>or</c></NS> if something <NS type="S"><i>terriable</i><c>terrible</c></NS> has happened <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> me, I <NS type="RV"><i>may not</i><c>do not have to</c></NS> run somewhere to find a telephone box. I just use my mobile phone. Finally, I can say that modern <NS type="FN"><i>technologies</i><c>technology</c></NS> <NS type="RY"><i>very</i><c>really</c></NS> <NS type="AGV"><i>help</i><c>helps</c></NS> people <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> their <NS type="FN"><i>works</i><c>work</c></NS>. With <NS type="AGA"><i>them</i><c>it</c></NS> people do their work more <NS type="S"><i>quikly</i><c>quickly</c></NS> and successfully.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>got</c></NS> me in <NS type="UD"><i>such</i></NS> trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed <NS type="UY"><i>together</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>with</c></NS> a host family in <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>surburb</i><c>suburb</c></NS> of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met <NS type="MV"><c>were</c></NS> very interesting so everything was perfect. We <NS type="W"><i>had mostly</i><c>mostly had</c></NS> a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>was</c></NS> only 19 years old <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> as everyone <NS type="AGV"><i>know</i><c>knows</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> the <NS type="ID"><i>majority</i><c>age of majority</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>for <NS type="IV"><i>beeing</i><c>being</c></NS></i><c>when you are</c></NS> able to go out in the USA<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> is 21 years old. If you <NS type="UV"><i>don't</i></NS> have <NS type="MY"><c>not</c></NS> <NS type="MV"><c>reached</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>your</c></NS> majority <NS type="DA"><i>your</i><c>you</c></NS> aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> even <NS type="RJ"><i>worth</i><c>worse</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> to go <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and <NS type="RA"><i>me</i><c>I</c></NS> decided to go <NS type="UY"><i>out</i></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. At the entrance, the security guard asked for <NS type="MD"><c>my</c></NS> identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>I've forgot</i><c>I'd forgotten</c></NS></i><c>I'd left</c></NS> it <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> home. The man said it was OK <NS type="UT"><i>for</i></NS> this time and we <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> in quite <NS type="DY"><i>easely</i><c>easily</c></NS>, <NS type="TV"><i>we've</i><c>we'd</c></NS> made it. It was such <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>get</c></NS> thirsty. We went <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the bar and <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>asked</c></NS> for <NS type="MD"><c>an</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>drink with alcohol</i><c>alcoholic drink</c></NS>. Of course by the time we <NS type="TV"><i>get</i><c>got</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> it we <NS type="TV"><i>forgot</i><c>had forgotten</c></NS> all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking <NS type="UA"><i><NS type="RP"><i>any time</i><c>anytime</c></NS></i></NS> 19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>ending</i><c>ended</c></NS> with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping <NS type="W"><i>so well a secret</i><c>a secret so well</c></NS>!!</p>
<p>During my last holiday <NS type="UN"><i>week</i></NS> in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the "Over the rainbow" show. I wanted to spend my <NS type="R"><i>leisure</i><c>free</c></NS> time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in the advertisement <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was written, as I had read <NS type="UC"><i>that</i></NS> before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, <NS type="RD"><i>the</i><c>a</c></NS> different actor stood in for <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>it</i><c>him</c></NS>. <NS type="R">The time of the beginning of the show</NS> was written <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>as</c></NS> half past two p.m. and <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> half past seven that evening, again. Lack of <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> time made me <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>go</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>to</c></NS> the evening show. And unfortunately again, <NS type="RT"><i>from</i><c>for</c></NS> some <NS type="FN"><i>reasons</i><c>reason</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was <NS type="RV"><i>postponed to</i><c>delayed until</c></NS> quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> was <NS type="RY"><i>exactly</i><c>definitely</c></NS> written <NS type="M"><c>that there were</c></NS> some <NS type="U"><i>of the</i></NS> discounts <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets. No, alas<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> in reality it appeared <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough <NS type="RY"><i>yet</i><c>still</c></NS>. At the end of the advertisement <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> I noticed it <NS type="TV"><i>was said</i><c>said</c></NS> something <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> perfect evening out. It wasn't <NS type="DJ"><i>truth</i><c>true</c></NS>. That's why I <NS type="TV"><i>write</i><c>am writing</c></NS> my letter to you and I <NS type="TV"><i>ask</i><c>am asking</c></NS> for my money back. I was expecting something <NS type="RY"><i>really</i><c>much</c></NS> better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> court.</p>
<p>I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology <NS type="TV"><i>affected</i><c>affect</c></NS> <NS type="RQ"><i>any</i><c>every</c></NS> aspect of my daily life. Looking back <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the past, I can see<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> how big <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> difference <NS type="MA"><c>there</c></NS> is between <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so <NS type="RY"><i>far</i><c>much</c></NS> as we <NS type="TV"><i>could</i><c>can</c></NS> now and couldn't <NS type="RV">express</NS> the news around the world as we do <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> now, <NS type="ID"><i>at present days</i><c>in the present day</c></NS>. They could not communicate with someone living in <NS type="RQ"><i>other</i><c>another</c></NS> country, <NS type="UY"><i>often</i></NS> located far away from <NS type="AGD"><i>his</i><c>their</c></NS> own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>, we have <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> better access to a lot of different <NS type="RN"><i>news</i><c>information</c></NS>.</p>
<p>No one told you to be famous. If you are famous<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> it was your choice and therefore <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> is <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> price <NS type="M"><c>you have</c></NS> to pay. Of course you have fame and <NS type="RN">poverty</NS>. But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the street.</p>
<p>I am a student <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> a technical <NS type="S"><i>univercity</i><c>university</c></NS>. Some time <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>ago</c></NS> I did not know <NS type="M"><c>anything about</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS>. When I <NS type="S"><i>neaded</i><c>needed</c></NS> some <NS type="CN"><i>informationes</i><c>information</c></NS> I had to go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>liblary</i><c>library</c></NS> to find it in books or newspapers. Now the only <NS type="SX"><i>think</i><c>thing</c></NS> I have to do is to go to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> computer room and turn on the computer. The computer is <NS type="DJ"><i>helpfull</i><c>helpful</c></NS> when I want to contact somebody very fast. I just send an e-mail and that is all!</p>
<p>The last example is that I have <NS type="W"><i>in my house a lot of modern equipment</i><c>a lot of modern equipment in my house</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> like <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> TV set, fridge <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>microwaves</i><c>microwave</c></NS> which help me <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> my <NS type="RN"><i>living</i><c>life</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> behalf of my <NS type="AGN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>class- maid</i><c>classmate</c></NS></i><c>classmates</c></NS> about the programme you <NS type="TV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> organised for us.</p>
<p>We all want to thank you for having <NS type="TV"><i>choose</i><c>chosen</c></NS> such good places in London. We are especially excited about the river trip to <NS type="RP"><i>greenwich</i><c>Greenwich</c></NS> which will be <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> the first day.</p>
<p>I would particularly like to talk about the second day. We really <NS type="TV"><i>liked</i><c>like</c></NS> the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> London <NS type="RP"><i>fashion and leisure show</i><c>Fashion and Leisure Show</c></NS> that will <NS type="RV"><i>happen</i><c>take place</c></NS> on <NS type="RP"><i>tuesday</i><c>Tuesday</c></NS> and we are very interested in <NS type="FV"><i>go</i><c>going</c></NS>. As you know our class <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> composed <NS type="RT"><i>by</i><c>of</c></NS> girls and it would be very exciting for us if we <NS type="TV"><i>can</i><c>could</c></NS> have a look <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>at</c></NS> the latest fashions, <NS type="RP"><i>make up</i><c>makeup</c></NS> and so on.</p>
<p>Last summer I went to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>amazon</i><c>Amazon</c></NS> on an expedition with <NS type="W"><i>other 10</i><c>10 other</c></NS> people<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>:</c></NS> <NS type="U"><i>such as</i></NS> a guide, a doctor, a scientist &amp; all the rest <NS type="M"><c>of us</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>as</i><c>like</c></NS> me were just curious.</p>
<p>One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without <NS type="MV"><c>being</c></NS> seen and started walking towards the river, because I <NS type="TV"><i>want</i><c>wanted</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>take</i><c>to take</c></NS> some photographs of the <NS type="RP"><i>sun rise</i><c>sunrise</c></NS>. The view <NS type="TV"><i>took</i><c>was taking</c></NS> my breath <NS type="RY"><i>of</i><c>away</c></NS> when suddenly something took my breath <NS type="MY"><c>away</c></NS>. It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as <NS type="MC"><c>if</c></NS> <NS type="AGA"><i>she</i><c>it</c></NS> was very hungry. I knew I could not <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>make</c></NS> any <NS type="S"><i>moviment</i><c>movement</c></NS> for my safety but I did and <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> my surprise <NS type="RP"><i>It</i><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>run</i><c>runs</c></NS></i><c>ran</c></NS> away.</p>
<p>First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> June so I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> <NS type="MY"><c>rather</c></NS> than <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> log <NS type="AGN"><i>cabins</i><c>cabin</c></NS>. Since I was a child, I have been <NS type="S"><i>intrested</i><c>interested</c></NS> in camping and sleeping <NS type="RT"><i>under</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> tents.</p>
<p>If I can participate <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful. I have been swimming <NS type="W"><i>for 8 years for a club</i><c>for a club for 8 years</c></NS> and <NS type="TV"><i>enjoying</i><c>enjoy</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> a lot. I am afraid<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I am not good at photography but I want to improve <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>Regarding</i><c>Considering</c></NS> that the school's maths team won <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> this year's <NS type="UP"><i>city's</i><c>city</c></NS> maths competition and is going <NS type="MY"><c>on</c></NS> to the national <NS type="RP"><i>school's</i><c>schools'</c></NS> maths championship, it <NS type="TV"><i>will</i><c>would</c></NS> be <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> good idea to film some of their training <NS type="AGN"><i>course</i><c>courses</c></NS> and also ordinary maths <NS type="AGN"><i>lesson</i><c>lessons</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>where</i><c>which</c></NS> the majority of the students attend.</p>
<p>I am writing to tell <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> that I had a very disappointing evening <NS type="RT"><i>regarding</i><c>at</c></NS> a musical show at your theatre. There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out.</p>
<p>Firstly, the advertisement <NS type="RV"><i>told</i><c>said</c></NS> that Danny Brook was going to <NS type="S"><i>starr</i><c>star</c></NS> in <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> musical but it turned out <NS type="MV"><c>to be</c></NS> a completely different person<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to <NS type="FV"><i>had</i><c>have</c></NS> <NS type="RV">printed</NS> <NS type="RD"><i>a</i><c>the</c></NS> wrong <NS type="DN">starring name</NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the paper. Secondly, according to the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS>, the musical was <NS type="S"><i>supprsed</i><c>supposed</c></NS> to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which caused me <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="RN"><i>trouble</i><c>problem</c></NS></i><c>problems</c></NS>. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said <NS type="R"><i>so</i><c>I would</c></NS> in the advertisement<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS>, <NS type="X"><i>it was not</i><c>none was</c></NS> <NS type="RY">actually</NS> available<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was recommended in the advertisement<NS type="RP"><i>, however</i><c>. However</c></NS>, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the <NS type="RN"><i>stuff</i><c>staff</c></NS> vacation<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which I thought was very unprofessional.</p>
<p><NS type="R"><i>After</i><c>When</c></NS> Molly went back home <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> Aberdeen, she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London. Then<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> suddenly, <NS type="R">Pat's face turned</NS> to look confused and <NS type="MA"><c>she</c></NS> said in a small voice, '<NS type="TV"><i>Haven't they broken</i><c>Didn't they break</c></NS> up <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> long time ago? Sally must have a new <NS type="RP"><i>boy friend</i><c>boyfriend</c></NS>'. As Molly didn't know this, she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it. Then, Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> a secret but it just came out of her mouth! She didn't mean to do <NS type="R"><i>so</i><c>it</c></NS>, but this kind of thing happens a lot. Now Pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because Molly isn't good at keeping secrets either! Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Poor</i><c>poor</c></NS> Vance is always the last person to know <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS>. </p>
<p>Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would <NS type="UV"><i>have</i></NS> spend my entire life <NS type="UV"><i>to do</i></NS> shopping. Although I am <NS type="R"><i>the one</i><c>someone</c></NS> who loves shopping, I <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>cannot</c></NS> stand <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> <NS type="CE">the Easters, the Christmas and Sundays, because those days are suitable for anyone to consume the food, buy some presents etc</NS>. However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and <NS type="MT"><c>at</c></NS> the same time. <NS type="RP"><i>it</i><c>It</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>causes</i><c>leads to</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>over crowded</i><c>overcrowded</c></NS> shops, <NS type="DJ"><i>high-pitch</i><c>high-pitched</c></NS> noise, <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> lack of parking <NS type="FN"><i>place</i><c>places</c></NS> and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole <NS type="MN"><c>thing</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>matters</i><c>is</c></NS> just <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not <NS type="RV"><i>resist</i><c>avoid</c></NS> <NS type="UV"><i>to do</i></NS> shopping <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special <NS type="FN"><i>service</i><c>services</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> such as sending your order <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> post or <NS type="M"><c>taking it</c></NS> on <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone. It could be the <NS type="RN"><i>solution</i><c>way</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>avoid</i><c>to avoid</c></NS> busy <NS type="RN"><i>hours</i><c>times</c></NS> or days<NS type="RP"><i>, do</i><c>. Do</c></NS> not <NS type="RV"><i>bring</i><c>take</c></NS> your child with you<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>;</c></NS> choose the right shop which has <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>park</i><c>car park</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> English class, especially <NS type="MC"><c>since</c></NS> it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> this <NS type="MP"><i>week</i><c>week's</c></NS> college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and <NS type="RP"><i>sports wear</i><c>sportswear</c></NS>, <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and <NS type="RP"><i>Hairstyles,</i><c>hairstyles.</c></NS> As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as <NS type="M"><c>advice about</c></NS> dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should <NS type="MV"><c>be</c></NS> a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> students in our class are studying Fashion <NS type="UT"><i>as</i></NS> full-time. Especially, it does not cost <NS type="MA"><c>anything</c></NS> at all for students. But the only problem <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these <NS type="AGN"><i>place</i><c>places</c></NS> the <NS type="UJ"><i>next</i></NS> following day. But Mr. Robertson, these <NS type="UD"><i>our</i></NS> suggestions <NS type="IV"><i>are depended</i><c>depend</c></NS> on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="TV"><i>give</i><c>are giving</c></NS></i><c>are causing</c></NS> you <NS type="UD"><i>an</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>inconvience</i><c>inconvenience</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> your plan and thank you for considering us. We are <NS type="FV"><i>look</i><c>looking</c></NS> forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Last week I went to the Circle theatre, <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> which you are <NS type="S"><i>responsable</i><c>responsible</c></NS>, to <NS type="S"><i>se</i><c>see</c></NS> the musical show "Over the Rainbow". The advertisement outside the theatre <NS type="RV"><i>explained</i><c>described</c></NS> a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring <NS type="MN"><c>role</c></NS>; you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had <NS type="RV"><i>joined</i><c>attended</c></NS> the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> changed the <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS>. Moreover the advertisement said that the <NS type="W"><i>show time</i><c>time of the show</c></NS> was 19.30; on the contrary it started <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> 45 minutes <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the <NS type="RJ"><i>whole</i><c>full</c></NS> <NS type="UN"><i>ticket's</i></NS> price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner.</p>
<p>I think modern technology has changed <NS type="RN"><i>human's</i><c>mankind's</c></NS> life a lot, <NS type="S"><i>expecially</i><c>especially</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>starting with the</i><c>since</c></NS> last century. The <NS type="DN"><i>changements</i><c>changes</c></NS> brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>without</c></NS> a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity <NS type="UV"><i>to get out</i></NS>: I live on a little mountain at 160 metres <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="S"><i>altitud</i><c>altitude</c></NS> so I cannot go to the city using a <NS type="S"><i>bycicle</i><c>bicycle</c></NS>. Because of my "isolation" <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> <NS type="UC"><i>so</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>study</i><c>to study</c></NS> or do <NS type="CN"><i>researches</i><c>research</c></NS>, because there are not <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover <NS type="W"><i>without a cellular phone my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city</i><c>my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city without a cellular phone</c></NS> because it is too far and she <NS type="RV"><i>is</i><c>gets</c></NS> worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like <NS type="W"><i>very much <NS type="FV"><i>play</i><c>to play</c></NS> guitar</i><c>to play guitar very much</c></NS>, and in my free time I prefer <NS type="FV"><i>play</i><c>to play</c></NS> electric, than acoustic or <NS type="RJ"><i>classic</i><c>classical</c></NS> guitar<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> it. Lots of information in your advertisement <NS type="AGV"><i>are</i><c>is</c></NS> not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to <NS type="RV"><i>be</i><c>have</c></NS> appeared.</p>
<p>Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing <NS type="RN"><i>entertainment</i><c>evening</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>at</c></NS> your <NS type="UJ"><i>musical</i></NS> show but <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>was not the case</i><c>didn't happen</c></NS>. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical <NS type="UN"><i>show</i></NS> was <NS type="RJ"><i>annoying</i><c>boring</c></NS>. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written <NS type="U"><i>on it</i></NS>. I had to wait for 45 minutes <NS type="UT"><i>without</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>nothing doing</i><c>doing nothing</c></NS>. I <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>wish</c></NS> you <NS type="TV"><i>informed</i><c>had informed</c></NS> us <NS type="RY"><i>before</i><c>beforehand</c></NS>.</p>
<p>First of all, as you <NS type="UY"><i>also</i></NS> know, lots of technology <NS type="AGV"><i>have</i><c>has</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>boosted</i><c>advanced</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>since</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> few years. For example, without using <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> I could not <NS type="RV"><i>put</i><c>get</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>me</i></NS> through to foreign people. This interactive <NS type="RN"><i>way</i><c>method</c></NS> of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> eagle. I can take advantage of <NS type="RQ"><i>those</i><c>such</c></NS> technologies as mobile <NS type="AGN"><i>phone</i><c>phones</c></NS>, lap top <NS type="AGN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS>, <NS type="AGN"><i>television</i><c>televisions</c></NS>, to have <NS type="FN"><i>contacts</i><c>contact</c></NS> with different cultures.</p>
<p>Do you remember the concert I helped at<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 <NS type="RP"><i>am</i><c>pm</c></NS><NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> to let them <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert <NS type="S"><i>orginazer</i><c>organiser</c></NS> wanted to know the <NS type="DJ"><i>exactly</i><c>exact</c></NS> number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my <NS type="RN">place</NS> and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and <NS type="S"><i>couts</i><c>coats</c></NS> of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things <NS type="MY"><c>in</c></NS> with them, like <NS type="IN"><i>knifes</i><c>knives</c></NS> or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard.</p>
<p>And for me, I think <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>tents</i><c>tent</c></NS> would be better<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I don't know why but<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> log cabins, and when I was sleeping <NS type="MA"><c>I</c></NS> felt <NS type="RP"><i>some thing</i><c>something</c></NS> moving <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> my skin, then I <NS type="RV"><i>work</i><c>woke</c></NS> up frightened and when I <NS type="IV"><i>openned</i><c>opened</c></NS> my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why!</p>
<p>- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become <NS type="RJ"><i>cumbersome</i><c>awkward</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> me.</p>
<p>I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> on the organization. I am also <NS type="IV"><i>writting</i><c>writing</c></NS> to make a suggestion and to give <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> my opinion <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>next's</i><c>next</c></NS> <NS type="MP"><i>year</i><c>year's</c></NS> festival.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize. It seems so exciting. I really look forward to taking part <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> Camp California.</p>
<p>"Shopping is not always enjoyable". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to <NS type="RV"><i>do</i><c>go</c></NS> shopping a lot when I was <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> university. I was 19 years old but I <NS type="TV"><i>spend</i><c>spent</c></NS> over 200 pounds <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> some weeks just to <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>keep</c></NS> myself <NS type="RJ"><i>up-to-date</i><c>fashionable</c></NS> all the time. I bought lots of new<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="DJ"><i>fashion</i><c>fashionable</c></NS> clothes, bags and shoes. <NS type="MT"><i>Four</i><c>For four</c></NS> years <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> university I never had <NS type="MQ"><c>any</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>saving money</i><c>savings</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to you in order to <NS type="FV"><i>describing</i><c>describe</c></NS> my last visit <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> your <NS type="SA"><i>theater</i><c>theatre</c></NS>. <NS type="DY"><i>Unfortunatly</i><c>Unfortunately</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I am <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> very disappointed about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> organisation <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> your company.</p>
<p><NS type="DY"><i>Firsty</i><c>Firstly</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> £20 because discounts were not available although <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your advertisement <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>they</c></NS> were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the <NS type="RJ"><i>grateful</i><c>great</c></NS> Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and <NS type="AS"><i>it was singing <NS type="SX"><i>a mother</i><c>another</c></NS> unknown person</i><c>another unknown person was singing</c></NS>. And last but not least<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> I <NS type="RV"><i>recognised</i><c>found out</c></NS> after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come...</p>
<p>I don't know <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> it is a typical situation in the Circle <NS type="S"><i>Theatrer</i><c>Theatre</c></NS> that <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is promised</i><c>promises</c></NS> much more then the people can get for their money, or <NS type="MC"><c>whether</c></NS> it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I <NS type="RV"><i>am</i><c>do</c></NS> not <NS type="RV"><i>agree with</i><c>approve of</c></NS> such <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> situation and <NS type="RV"><i>would</i><c>must</c></NS> ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed. I am looking forward <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="DD"><i>you</i><c>your</c></NS> <NS type="DN"><i>answering</i><c>answer</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="S"><i>Secondely</i><c>Secondly</c></NS><NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> we can do our jobs today more <NS type="DY"><i>efficient</i><c>efficiently</c></NS>. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our <NS type="RN"><i><NS type="FN"><i>partner</i><c>partners</c></NS></i><c>clients</c></NS> faster and better and offer them better <NS type="FN"><i>service</i><c>services</c></NS>. <NS type="UD"><i>The ordered</i><c>Ordered</c></NS> goods can be <NS type="TV"><i>deliver</i><c>delivered</c></NS> in <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> shorter time by <NS type="FN"><i>train</i><c>trains</c></NS>, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>in</c></NS> our daily life - <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> better clothes, furniture, <NS type="R">spare time</NS>.</p>
<p>I am a fan <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>of</c></NS> modern technology.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>which</i><c>who</c></NS> is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot. <NS type="R">We'll</NS> understand why I'm writing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> the past.</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially <NS type="MT"><c>because of</c></NS> the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go and see it.</p>
<p>As you are probably aware <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="RV"><i>made</i><c>drawn up</c></NS> us a very nice schedule</i><c>drawn up a very nice schedule for us</c></NS>. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but <NS type="RT"><i>due to</i><c>because of</c></NS> the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class <NS type="TV"><i>asked</i><c>have asked</c></NS> me to <NS type="RV"><i>propose</i><c>suggest</c></NS> a change in our schedule.</p>
<p>This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>sports wear</i><c>sportswear</c></NS>, make up<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would <NS type="TV"><i>be having</i><c>have</c></NS> fun, <NS type="TV"><i>meeting</i><c>meet</c></NS> the locals and <NS type="TV"><i>practising</i><c>practise</c></NS> our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school.</p>
<p>The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show. Our free time on Wednesday could be spent <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>Museum</i><c>museum</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Best Detective Stories <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> Agatha Christie</p>
<p>I'm sorry it took me so long to <NS type="AS"><i>write you back</i><c>write back to you</c></NS>, but I have <NS type="TV"><i>being</i><c>been</c></NS> very busy lately<NS type="RP"><i>:</i><c>.</c></NS> Anyway, <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> your last letter you asked me whether<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> Best Detective Stories <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>by</c></NS> Agatha Christie would be <NS type="W"><i>or not a good present</i><c>a good present or not</c></NS> for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea!</p>
<p>Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on <NS type="FN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS><NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>?</c></NS> My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>College</i><c>college</c></NS>. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time!</p>
<p>As we have seen the <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> the <NS type="DN"><i>programmed</i><c>programme</c></NS> the school <NS type="RV"><i>set</i><c>arranged</c></NS> for us as a farewell <NS type="AGN"><i>activities</i><c>activity</c></NS>, we are very <NS type="DJ"><i>appreciate</i><c>appreciative</c></NS> and would like to thank <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> for your kindness, as all of <NS type="R">them</NS> are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and <NS type="RV">join</NS> the other class<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which we <NS type="TV"><i>hardly done</i><c>have hardly done</c></NS> <NS type="R"><i>it before</i><c>at all</c></NS>.</p>
<p>It was dangerous, but I <NS type="TV"><i>know</i><c>knew</c></NS> I had to do it. Even though all of my friends who were with me <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> that day <NS type="UQ"><i>all</i></NS> said<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> "Just let it go, it's <NS type="CL"><i>just only</i><c>only</c></NS> a puppy. Why do you have to take a risk?" It seemed that <NS type="X"><i>all of them didn't have</i><c>none of them had</c></NS> any sympathy <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>for</c></NS> that lovely <NS type="DJ"><i>blue eyes</i><c>blue-eyed</c></NS> puppy that somebody who <NS type="TV"><i>have</i><c>had</c></NS> no mercy <NS type="TV"><i>just left</i><c>had just left</c></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>it</i></NS> there, <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> a highway.</p>
<p>I think the only way of <NS type="FV"><i>change</i><c>changing</c></NS> that is<NS type="U"><i>, the people,</i></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>If</i><c>if</c></NS> the people <NS type="AGV"><i>shows</i><c>show</c></NS> no interest <NS type="M"><c>because then</c></NS> the journalist would have no <NS type="RN"><i>goal</i><c>reason</c></NS> <NS type="UT"><i>of</i></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>publish</i><c>to publish</c></NS> any <NS type="CN"><i>gossips</i><c>gossip</c></NS> because <NS type="MA"><c>it</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>is not going to be</i><c>would not be</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i>watch</i><c>watched</c></NS> or read by anyone. So the power is <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>with</c></NS> the people.</p>
<p>We all think the programme is organised well<NS type="RP"><i>, <NS type="RY"><i>especially</i><c>in particular</c></NS></i><c>. In particular</c></NS> we're so keen on the idea <NS type="MT"><c>of</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>to go</i><c>going</c></NS> to the National Art Gallery, to see <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> work of the <NS type="RJ"><i><NS type="IJ"><i>bigest</i><c>biggest</c></NS></i><c>greatest</c></NS> painters <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the world.</p>
<p>The show will be in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday, <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> 14th of March<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>between</i><c>from</c></NS> 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> next day.</p>
<p>My story <NS type="TV"><i>began</i><c>begins</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>during</c></NS> my holiday. It was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine <NS type="TV"><i>have decided</i><c>decided</c></NS> to go <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> holiday this year to the <NS type="RP"><i><NS type="SX"><i>see</i><c>sea</c></NS> side</i><c>seaside</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I <NS type="TV"><i>look</i><c>looked</c></NS> around and I <NS type="S"><i>relised</i><c>realised</c></NS> <NS type="RD"><i>one</i><c>a</c></NS> friend of mine <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>was</c></NS> still in the <NS type="SX"><i>see</i><c>sea</c></NS>, and fighting <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>against</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> storm, trying to get to the <NS type="RN"><i>side</i><c>shore</c></NS>.</p>
<p>What is more, there were no discounts available <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the ticket <NS type="RN"><i>fees</i><c>prices</c></NS> nor <NS type="W"><i>we had</i><c>had we</c></NS> the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don't really mind what people will be wearing in 100 years' time. As for me the only thing I care <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>about</c></NS> in the morning is that I don't have <NS type="UD"><i>my</i></NS> <NS type="W"><i>socks mismatched</i><c>mismatched socks</c></NS>!</p>
<p>Firstly, <NS type="R">I am being the representative of my class</NS> to <NS type="FV"><i>thanks</i><c>thank</c></NS> <NS type="MA"><c>you</c></NS> for organising a good programme in London, especially the <NS type="DN"><i>visiting</i><c>visit</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and <NS type="MA"><c>we</c></NS> can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> two places before. So we <NS type="TV"><i>decide</i><c>decided</c></NS> to choose <NS type="RQ"><i>the other</i><c>another</c></NS> <NS type="RN"><i>programme</i><c>event</c></NS> <NS type="R">which have seen as an entertainment</NS>. It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>hold</i><c>held</c></NS> at <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is <NS type="UT"><i>on</i></NS> Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> including leisure and sports wear. In spite of <NS type="FA"><i>these</i><c>this</c></NS>, there <NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS> also <NS type="MP"><i>make up</i><c>make-up</c></NS> and hairstyles<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which <NS type="R">attract girls most</NS>.</p>
<p>For me, I think people's <NS type="FN"><i>home</i><c>homes</c></NS> may not be built on the ground. The <NS type="FN"><i>home</i><c>homes</c></NS> will be built <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the <NS type="FN"><i>home</i><c>homes</c></NS> <NS type="TV"><i><NS type="AGV"><i>is</i><c>are</c></NS></i><c>will be</c></NS> built <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the sky<NS type="RP"><i>. It</i><c>, it</c></NS> will save a lot of electricity as solar energy <NS type="TV"><i>is</i><c>will be</c></NS> used.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> electrical goods, there <NS type="X"><i>will be no any</i><c>will not be any</c></NS> kind of electrical <NS type="AGN"><i>products</i><c>product</c></NS> except <NS type="FN"><i>computer</i><c>computers</c></NS>. People will do <NS type="RA"><i>anything</i><c>everything</c></NS> on the computer, including watching TV, <NS type="FV"><i>listen</i><c>listening</c></NS> to music, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="FV"><i>chat</i><c>chatting</c></NS> with people<NS type="RP"><i>. As</i><c>, as</c></NS> the computer is <NS type="U"><i>being as</i></NS> a multi-functional <NS type="AGN"><i>products</i><c>product</c></NS>.</p>
<p>How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance <NS type="UT"><i>in</i></NS> to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main <NS type="S"><i>adventage</i><c>advantage</c></NS> is that<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> it provides you <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS> all the <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> that you need. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> you have to write an Essay about <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> <NS type="UP"><i>2-nd</i><c>2nd</c></NS> world war. You get <NS type="RT"><i>into</i><c>on to</c></NS> the <NS type="RP"><i>internet</i><c>Internet</c></NS> and you're looking for those facts and <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. <NS type="RP"><i>Further more</i><c>Furthermore</c></NS> you can play with the computer, and <NS type="S"><i>unfortunetly</i><c>unfortunately</c></NS> this <NS type="RN"><i>advantage</i><c>fact</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>has especially</i><c>especially has</c></NS> changed my life.</p>
<p>I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival. <NS type="UC"><i>As</i></NS> I saw <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> the advertisement<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> there <NS type="TV"><i>were</i><c>would be</c></NS> stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries <NS type="MV"><c>represented</c></NS>. It would be better if there were more than six countries.</p>
<p>Firstly I want to <NS type="S"><i>congratualate</i><c>congratulate</c></NS> you <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there <NS type="AGV"><i>was</i><c>were</c></NS> only <NS type="RN"><i>starts</i><c>stars</c></NS> from six major countries. I suggest you <NS type="TV"><i>to increase</i><c>increase</c></NS> this number for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> next year. <NS type="RT"><i>By</i><c>In</c></NS> this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I <NS type="RV"><i>will</i><c>want to</c></NS> point <NS type="RY"><i>on</i><c>out</c></NS> is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>enter</i><c>get into</c></NS> the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? <NS type="MD"><c>The</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>Last</i><c>last</c></NS> thing that I will say is "one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"<NS type="UP"><i>.</i></NS> <NS type="UA"><i>It</i></NS> was <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> very good idea. I hope you will <NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>do</c></NS> the same thing next year.</p>
<p>These are <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> my suggestions. I hope you will listen <NS type="MT"><c>to</c></NS> my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>at</c></NS> the festival.</p>
<p>"Oh, God" - thought Paul - "the next time I will throw a frog <NS type="RT"><i>inside</i><c>into</c></NS> Pat's rucksack."</p>
<p>Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have <NS type="RV"><i>been</i><c>stayed</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>at</i><c>in</c></NS> log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it. This time I want to try something different.</p>
<p>If I had the <NS type="RN"><i>possibility</i><c>choice</c></NS>, I would never go shopping <NS type="RT"><i>to</i><c>in</c></NS> the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you <NS type="RP"><i>can not</i><c>can't</c></NS> find the items <NS type="RA"><i>what</i><c>that</c></NS> you want to buy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason <NS type="S"><i>whe</i><c>why</c></NS> we were <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> horrible <NS type="FN"><i>troubles</i><c>trouble</c></NS> with <NS type="MD"><c>the</c></NS> police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>to</c></NS> us.</p>
<p>Let's <NS type="MV"><c>go</c></NS> back to the <NS type="S"><i>beginig</i><c>beginning</c></NS> of this story. I <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>and</c></NS> my friends had <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>holidays</i><c>holiday</c></NS> and decided to spend a few days on <NS type="FD"><i>a</i><c>an</c></NS> "island". We called this place <NS type="UT"><i>like</i></NS> this, because it was a <NS type="MQ"><c>piece of</c></NS> land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> land - to our town. There was no light <NS type="RT"><i>during</i><c>at</c></NS> <NS type="FN"><i>nights</i><c>night</c></NS> so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered <NS type="CQ"><i>a</i><c>some</c></NS> gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place <NS type="SX"><i>when</i><c>where</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> robber <NS type="S"><i>keept</i><c>kept</c></NS> <NS type="W"><i>stolen gold</i><c>gold stolen</c></NS> from <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> bank. We found the solution <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> this <NS type="S"><i>deceperous</i><c>desperate</c></NS> situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but...</p>
<p>To begin with, we enjoy reading <NS type="CN"><i>gossips</i><c>gossip</c></NS> about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't <NS type="DJ"><i>truly</i><c>true</c></NS>. In addition we are fascinated <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>by</c></NS> their <NS type="FN"><i>marriage</i><c>marriages</c></NS>, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and <NS type="UP"><i>well-known</i><c>well known</c></NS>. <NS type="R"><i>By</i><c>When</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>chosing</i><c>choosing</c></NS> this style of life they should realise<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> <NS type="AS"><i>how their life would <NS type="RV"><i>look</i><c>be</c></NS> like</i><c>what their life would be like</c></NS>.</p>
<p>To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars <NS type="RC"><i>or</i><c>and</c></NS> politicians have a right <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>to</c></NS> <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>one</c></NS>. Otherwise they can <NS type="RV"><i>get</i><c>suffer</c></NS> <NS type="RN">soul</NS> problems, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> fall <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> deep <NS type="CN"><i>depressions</i><c>depression</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>in</c></NS> July. I can't change <NS type="UY"><i>anymore</i></NS> the date <NS type="R"><i>of <NS type="S"><i>umployment</i><c>employment</c></NS></i><c>I start work</c></NS> because I signed the contract a month ago<NS type="RP"><i>:</i><c>.</c></NS> I hope <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS> will not <NS type="AS"><i><NS type="RV"><i>make</i><c>cause</c></NS> problems to you</i><c>cause you problems</c></NS>.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>Regarding</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>accomodation</i><c>accommodation</c></NS>, I would prefer to have a log cabin<NS type="RP"><i>, it</i><c>.  It</c></NS> would be better to <NS type="RV"><i>let</i><c>leave</c></NS> money or anything <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> without <NS type="RV"><i>thinking of</i><c>worrying about</c></NS> theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I <NS type="TV"><i>never have</i><c>have never had</c></NS> the opportunity to <NS type="RV"><i>discover</i><c>try</c></NS> this sport. When I saw <NS type="MC"><c>that</c></NS> you <NS type="RV"><i>propose</i><c>offer</c></NS> this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've <NS type="RV"><i>done</i><c>been</c></NS> sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I <NS type="TV"><i>was</i><c>have been</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> sailing teacher <NS type="R">on summers the past few years</NS>.</p>
<p>Life at school is made of several things. <NS type="RP"><i>first</i><c>First</c></NS>, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us <NS type="MT"><c>with</c></NS>. But there are also a <NS type="AGN"><i>lots</i><c>lot</c></NS> of clubs and activities that <NS type="RV"><i>take part</i><c>form part</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> account in the video we will make.</p>
<p><NS type="RT"><i>For</i><c>As for</c></NS> other activities, we could probably show <NS type="W"><i>a training one of our <NS type="DJ"><i>sport</i><c>sports</c></NS> <NS type="AGN"><i>team</i><c>teams</c></NS></i><c>one of our sports teams training</c></NS>. For example<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> the <NS type="W"><i>team basketball</i><c>basketball team</c></NS> which has won the student regional <NS type="DN"><i>tittle</i><c>title</c></NS> (we can also say <NS type="RA"><i>it</i><c>that</c></NS>) or the <NS type="W"><i>team of football</i><c>football team</c></NS>. After all, it is not important <NS type="R"><i>the</i><c>which</c></NS> one we will show<NS type="RP"><i>.</i><c>,</c></NS> but I think we must <NS type="RV"><i>give</i><c>create</c></NS> a good picture of the school <NS type="R"><i>with</i><c>through</c></NS> sport.</p>
<p>I have <NS type="S"><i>alredy</i><c>already</c></NS> thought about a <NS type="RN"><i>changing</i><c>change</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>to</c></NS> the programme. On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time <NS type="MT"><c>by</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>doing</i><c>going</c></NS> shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we <NS type="RV">moved</NS> have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show.</p>
<p>I hope you will take my proposal <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> <NS type="UJ"><i><NS type="S"><i>favoreable</i><c>favourable</c></NS></i></NS> consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely</p>
<p>It was a fantastic sunny day <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>in</c></NS> August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided <NS type="UV"><i>to go</i></NS> to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We <NS type="IV"><i>lied</i><c>lay</c></NS> on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach <NS type="RN"><i>volley</i><c>volleyball</c></NS> matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons <NS type="UY"><i>before</i></NS> and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>at</c></NS> me. So I took the decision to go and join them <NS type="RY"><i>also</i><c>as well</c></NS> <NS type="RC"><i>if</i><c>though</c></NS> I knew that it would <NS type="FV"><i>have been</i><c>be</c></NS> dangerous <NS type="R">for my life</NS>. I <NS type="RV"><i>walked</i><c>waded</c></NS> very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends <NS type="RV"><i>could</i><c>would</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i>understand</i><c>realize</c></NS> that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided <NS type="FV"><i>taking</i><c>to take</c></NS> up swimming, so that I would <NS type="TV"><i>have had</i><c>have</c></NS> no <NS type="FN"><i><NS type="DN"><i>embarrass</i><c>embarrassment</c></NS></i><c>embarrassments</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> future trips to the seaside <NS type="UY"><i>any more</i></NS>.</p>
<p>I have <NS type="W"><i>been recently</i><c>recently been</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> London and <NS type="TV"><i>I've seen</i><c>I saw</c></NS> the <NS type="RN"><i>art</i><c>show</c></NS> "Over <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> Rainbow" at The Circle Theatre. I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me. It should <NS type="TV"><i>start</i><c>have started</c></NS> at 19.30 and it <NS type="RV"><i>had</i><c>started</c></NS> at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed. But the worst thing <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>about</c></NS> "London's newest and best musical show", as you called it, was the <NS type="DN"><i>abscentness</i><c>absence</c></NS> of Danny Brook. The actor <NS type="RA"><i><NS type="S"><i>wich</i><c>which</c></NS></i><c>who</c></NS> was "dancing" was horrible. He <NS type="TV"><i>had been</i><c>was</c></NS> <NS type="RV"><i><NS type="IV"><i>mistakeing</i><c>mistaking</c></NS></i><c>making mistakes</c></NS> all the time. <NS type="RT"><i>At</i><c>In</c></NS> the advertisement, <NS type="RA"><i>there</i><c>it</c></NS> was written "your perfect evening out". Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money<NS type="RP"><i>,</i><c>.</c></NS> I hope that in future you will <NS type="S"><i>corect</i><c>correct</c></NS> all <NS type="AGD"><i>this</i><c>these</c></NS> mistakes.</p>
<p><NS type="RA"><i>That</i><c>It</c></NS> was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited. He was very keen on going <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>to</c></NS> the mountains.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the father stopped and said: "Here we are!" They were near a little house<NS type="UP"><i>,</i></NS> built <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>of</c></NS> wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family.</p>
<p>Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>out of</c></NS> wood.</p>
<p>Lastly, could I ask you something? <NS type="RY"><i>How</i><c>What</c></NS> is the weather like in California? Do I need clothes with long sleeves? How much money should I bring? Can I change money <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>into</c></NS> US dollars there?</p>
<p>I think it is very kind of <NS type="IA"><i>yous</i><c>you</c></NS> to ask me what my preferences are <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>regarding</c></NS> the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel <NS type="MT"><c>in</c></NS> the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays <NS type="AGV"><i>starts</i><c>start</c></NS>. <NS type="FV"><i>Answering</i><c>To answer</c></NS> another of your questions, I am more likely <NS type="MV"><c>to want</c></NS> to stay in a log cabin<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> considering that I will be <NS type="SX"><i>to</i><c>two</c></NS> weeks in the camp. They are much more <NS type="S"><i>confortable</i><c>comfortable</c></NS> than tents.</p>
<p>But one night, with the <NS type="RP"><i>moon light</i><c>moonlight</c></NS>, they felt encouraged to continue their walk. Pat was a little bit afraid, but Kim convinced her to follow her saying that she knew the street. But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming <NS type="RT"><i>forward</i><c>toward</c></NS> them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: "Our secret!"</p>
<p>Then, in the <NS type="SA"><i>program</i><c>programme</c></NS> I could read <NS type="MT"><c>about</c></NS> a discount available <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>on</c></NS> the tickets, for <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> groups, but I couldn't <NS type="RV"><i>have</i><c>get</c></NS> that. I couldn't have all the things I expected.</p>
<p>That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>with</c></NS> your <NS type="CN"><i>informations</i><c>information</c></NS> and I ask <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> some money back.</p>
<p>Peter and Sue asked <NS type="UT"><i>to</i></NS> Francis <NS type="MT"><c>for</c></NS> some help <NS type="RT"><i>for</i><c>with</c></NS> their <NS type="UP"><i>exam's</i><c>exam</c></NS> <NS type="S"><i>subjets</i><c>subjects</c></NS> and Francis, <NS type="AS"><i>for to help them, was very busy all the week</i><c>all week, was too busy to help them</c></NS>. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this. In the afternoon she had phoned <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> <NS type="UD"><i>a</i></NS> Francis's mother and she <NS type="RV"><i>explained</i><c>told</c></NS> her the secret, then she phoned <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> her best friend and she <NS type="TV"><i>speak</i><c>spoke</c></NS> about that <NS type="RY"><i>too</i><c>again</c></NS>; she phoned <NS type="UT"><i>at</i></NS> many people all <NS type="UD"><i>the</i></NS> day. Now <NS type="RQ"><i>many</i><c>a lot of</c></NS> people knew the secret but Pat <NS type="RV"><i>said</i><c>told</c></NS> everyone: "I <NS type="MV"><c>will</c></NS> tell you a small secret, but <NS type="W"><i>you don't</i><c>don't you</c></NS> speak <NS type="M"><c>about it</c></NS>, please!"</p>
<p>What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is <NS type="FV"><i>wandering</i><c>to wander</c></NS> around and <NS type="FV"><i>looking</i><c>to look</c></NS> at everything. Having money and <NS type="FV"><i>be</i><c>being</c></NS> able to spend it <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>on</c></NS> anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> an enjoyable <NS type="RN"><i>moment</i><c>experience</c></NS>.</p>
<p>I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an <NS type="S"><i>advertisment</i><c>advertisement</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>about</i><c>for</c></NS> <NS type="RP"><i>The</i><c>the</c></NS> London Fashion And Leisure Show.</p>
<p>I suggest that we should <NS type="RV"><i>transfer</i><c>move</c></NS> our visit to the Science Museum <NS type="RT"><i>on</i><c>to</c></NS> Wednesday afternoon <NS type="R">in our free time that we have</NS>. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>As I knew the <NS type="S"><i>teknics</i><c>techniques</c></NS> to break <NS type="RT"><i>in</i><c>into</c></NS> a place without being noticed, I should not <NS type="TV"><i>be</i><c>have been</c></NS> afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> which was very well <NS type="RJ"><i>secured</i><c>protected</c></NS>.</p>
<p>When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily <NS type="X"><i>was not</i><c>nobody was</c></NS>. Then I approached <NS type="W"><i>slowly the door</i><c>the door slowly</c></NS>, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were <NS type="S"><i>laisers</i><c>lasers</c></NS> all over the place, <NS type="UT"><i>with</i></NS> which I had to be careful <NS type="RT"><i>with</i><c>of</c></NS>.</p>
<p>Suddenly something went wrong<NS type="RP"><i>, the</i><c>. The</c></NS> alarm was making <NS type="MD"><c>a</c></NS> noise. I ran towards the diamond<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> <NS type="IV"><i>grabed</i><c>grabbed</c></NS> it<NS type="MP"><c>,</c></NS> got out quickly, <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> ran out of the back door. By <NS type="RN"><i>surprise</i><c>chance</c></NS> I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car <NS type="MC"><c>and</c></NS> gave the <NS type="SA"><i>jewelry</i><c>jewellery</c></NS> in exchange <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>for</c></NS> my brother, took him and left the place.</p>
<p>Do you know "Radio Head"? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some <NS type="RN"><i>signatures</i><c>autographs</c></NS> <NS type="RT"><i>of</i><c>from</c></NS> them. It's brilliant, isn't it?</p>
