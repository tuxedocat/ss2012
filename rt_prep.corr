For the reasons above, I, indeed, spent an awful last night in London.
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PREPARING SUCH A GOOD PROGRAMME FOR US AND ESPECIALLY FOR TAKING US ON THE RIVER TRIP TO GREENWICH. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS ANY CHANCE OF CHANGING THE PROGRAMME BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND A VERY INTERESTING ACTIVITY TO DO ON TUESDAY 14 MARCH. IT INVOLVES VISITING THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW AT THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL. I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE GREATER USE OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. ALSO, WE COULD LEARN THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET TO THE CENTRAL EXHIBITION HALL.
FAMOUS PEOPLE SUCH AS SINGERS, FILM STARS, ETC, ARE ALWAYS THE CENTRE OF ATTENTION. AS SOME OF THEM ARE CONSIDERED IDOLS, THEIR FANS WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY BEHAVE IN THEIR PRIVATE LIVES, WITH THEIR FAMILY OR FRIENDS. AS A RESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND FOR INFORMATION, JOURNALISTS FOLLOW FAMOUS PEOPLE DAY AND NIGHT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, FOR EXAMPLE, CHASING THEIR CARS, TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR BREAKING INTO THEIR HOUSES WHILE THEY ARE ON HOLIDAY.
I have seen your programme for the trip and I think it is going to be a great trip. Thank you very much for organising this trip and putting all your spare time and effort into it. Personally, I enjoy looking at and learning about new inventions and all the science. That is why I think the trip to the science museum is a good idea. However, my class and I have seen an advertisement for a fashion and leisure show. We are attracted to this show and would like to go. Unfortunately, it is on 14th March, which is the day we will be visiting the science museum.
I would like to travel in July because  it is more suitable for me. I think I will really enjoy it if I can stay in a tent.  It is going to be a new experience and looks exciting.
About the activities while at the Camp, I would like to do swimming, not because I am good at it, just because I am keen on it and the other one is Photography.
Last month, I enjoyed helping at a pop concert in Portugal. Everything was new for me. I had to  tidy up the place where they have to wait for their turn. The group asked me to make sure that in the fridge they always could find a wide variety of drinks including honey and lemon for the throat.
The other thing I had to do was keep an eye on the towels, I mean, dry towels because as you know that country is too hot, especially for my liking, and they have to change  clothes and look fresh; don't ask me why.
The festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea. I assume that this fact attracted people very much. In addition to that, organising one weekend with special price tickets was particularly good. I personally think that it helped many people who were not able to afford the tickets at the normal price to come to the festival. Moreover, most of the events I went to were fantastic.
However, I still have some comments to make to improve the festival next year. The festival was supposed to be an international one, but the artists and stars  who participated in it were from six countries only. Thus, I recommend that stars and artists of various nationalities should be invited. Also, some of the concert halls where the musicians performed were not big enough for the vast number of attendees. I think it would be much better to use bigger concert halls. Furthermore, I found that there were not many genres in either the films or the plays. So I suggest you have various kinds, and more  plays and films next year.
Above all, realistic stories teach me something about  life, or at least influence me. As far as I'm concerned, my behaviour and attitudes towards a difficult situation began to change after reading this book. Here, the fishman is very old, but he is still challenging  everything he faces. When he caught a shark which was bigger than the ship, he never gave up on taking it back to his village, even when sharks were around him. Real stories have huge impacts on me, and affect me a lot, often in good ways.
The musical should have started at 19.30, but it started at 20.15. When I went to ask for the discount on the ticket at the cashier desk they told me no discount was available . I had seen the advertisement saying that a discount was available.
I think in the next 100 years people will wear   with a small engine in the back, because of the atmosphere. The atmosphere of the earth is now deteriorating badly every year.
MY NAME is JAMES CAMIREZ AND I AM WRITING THIS LETTER TO YOU BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE DISAPPOINTING EVENING I HAD LAST NIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, IN THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE SHOW IT SAID THAT THE ACTOR WAS GOING TO BE DANNY BROOK AND INSTEAD OF HIM THERE WAS A TOTALLY UNKNOWN CLOWN THAT HAD NO IDEA OF HOW TO ACT. IT WAS HORRIBLY DISAPPOINTING!
THEN I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT, "DISCOUNTS AVAILABLE", AND I DIDN'T GET ANY DISCOUNTS WHEN I ASKED FOR THEM.
On Wednesday after we have visited the National Art Gallery, we can have a chat about our next holiday during the free time in the afternoon.
The advertisement that the students saw is for a fashion show, but to go to the show you will need to cancel the tour on Tuesday and add the show, because the show is from 10.00 to 19.00.
It is really interesting how people like to know about famous people's lives. Without someone famous knowing, photographers take pictures secretly, and try to get money for them.
At that moment she understood that something was wrong!
Thank you for organising a good programme, we especially like  in London for three days. I am writing on behalf of my classmates to give you the information about 'The London Fashion And Leisure Show' which we would like to go to and to offer our opinion.
Whenever I recollect it, I feel self-confident. When I was twenty years old, I had to go into the Army. As you know, my country has been separated into two countries (South and North Korea). However, instead of going into the Army, I was able to apply to join the Korea Auxiliary Police.
As you asked in the letter, I would like to travel only in July because I work at the central library and I'm also having English classes, so I will just have holidays in July. Is that suitable for you?
I examined all the activities that you listed and I was disappointed to have to choose just two of them because in my opinion I'm good at almost all of these activities. However, I would choose sailing because I am fascinated with the sea and its mysteries and I also like the water, the wind in my face... The other one I would choose is basketball because I'm tall and very fast with the ball.
I would like to come in July, because I am studying English and we have a one-month break in July, so please book my log cabin for July.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I had some experience of tents in my childhood and it was not a very good experience, therefore I would like to stay in a cabin.
Anyway we had a very disappointing evening. First, we couldn't get a discount, although you mention it in your advertisement. And the only tickets left were  Â£20. Then the show began 45 minutes later than stated. Last but not least, Danny Brook was replaced by a different actor, whose name I probably forgot because of his poor performance. We are used to eating at your restaurant which is not only well known for it's good  value but also for it's original decor.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't really good at keeping secrets. The following story will prove it. I left the office at six o'clock. I was free as the air. My husband was doing a course all  week in Berne. The kids were with their grandmother, who takes care of them.
I drove to Ouchy where I had a drink. It was so hot, I decided to go for a swim in tutry, although I hadn't a swimming costume. I knew a good place. I parked the car and waited ten minutes. As I had planned, the place was deserted. I took my clothes off and swam for twenty minutes in the lake. Coming back, I noticed that my clothes were missing. I walked back, hoping I wouldn't come across anyone and be able to drive back home. The car was missing too.
On behalf of the class I would like to thank you for the excellent programme you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a gallery.
Would it be possible to cancel the museum and the shopping  and to replace them with the London Show? We could go earlier to the Museum or on the 15th March instead of in the afternoon during our free time.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I had always wanted to swim with sharks.
One Saturday I got into my motorboat and rode far away from the reef. My father was sitting next to me, thinking that I was crazy. Some minutes later I was doing it, spending time with the fish, swimming round the sharks.
I went to your show called "Over The Rainbow" and I was really disappointed by many things.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The nightmare started . I thought she was a really good friend but I made a mistake. She couldn't keep my secret and everybody knew which boy I was in love with. She didn't tell me  but when I came to the class everybody was looking at me and this boy as well. I looked at her and she became pale and suddenly left the class. I followed her and caught her to push her to the ground. I was ready to fight but somebody stopped me. I couldn't go back to the class so I went home. My Mum was at home and I told her the whole story. She said that I had to be strong and not care about them. So I went to the class and everybody was laughing at me and the boy told them to stop because he loved me and wanted to be with me. Then all the girls became jealous and stopped laughing.
I would like to travel in July because I will be on my school vacation, so I would not miss my classes.
Since we were kids people have told us stories about two sides in conflict: the good and the bad side. The good always win, and we are told that the other part is bad, and that is the end of the story. But isn't evil interesting?
In the tale "It's a good life", the author gives much more emphasis to  Witte Anthony than to anyone else in the story. He is the main character, although he is mean, cruel and . He controls the other people using the power of his mind.
Although the other people in the story are the good ones and suffer from his domination, they are quite poor and empty, not interesting and not well described, meanwhile Anthony is a very interesting and different person, and all his thoughts are told to us by the author.
First thing is the computer. When I was a university student, I had to find out some information for my homework. I could not get it. but a computer allowed me to get it from the Internet.
I am writing to you because I have recently been to your musical show at the Circle Theatre but I'm sorry to say that I had a very disappointing evening.
I was in London for a week's holiday and I decided to go to the theatre. I saw your musical show advertised in my hotel and I decided to buy a ticket. I am still a student and I saw in the advertisement that there were some discounts available. I asked about it but the answer I received was that there weren't any kind of discounts. I arrived at the theatre at 19.00 and I thought I'd have waited only thirty minutes. I waited more than one hour because the show started at 20.15. But, at that moment, I thought that these things can happen. When the musical show started I had the third bad surprise. The male actor wasn't Danny Brook but an actor that I've never seen before. At the end of the show I was very hungry and so I had the brilliant idea to decide to go to the theatre restaurant but, of course, it was closed!
The first thing I do every day, when I get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine. Then I go to work by motorbike. The first thing I do when I arrive at my office is to switch on my computer. All  day I speak with the majority of my colleagues by telephone or e-mail. Sometimes I am alone all  day but I have contact with many people.
First of all I want to thank you for the excellent programme that you arranged for my class in such a short time. The students are especially  happy about the visit to the Science Museum, which we are going to make on Tuesday morning on 14th March.
The only problem is that the show is going to take place on Tuesday  14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes to your programme. My class think that it is a great opportunity for them to see the show, because Tuesday is the last day that the show is going to be .
What about rooms which can sense your mood and act according to that? If you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing music on and turn down the light a little bit. The next step might be a robot which would do all your housework, but what would happen to the people?
I think that everyone should think not just about the positive side of technology but also the negative.
I find it unbearable to witness such  deceitful advertising and to even pay ten pounds to have such a disappointing evening. Consequently, I ask for my money back, and I will obviously not go back to the Circle Theatre. I attach my receipt, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Over the last five years, she has caused many arguments because of unkept secrets, but she couldn't help speaking to everybody. This time, as Katie, her cousin, had told her, their friend Bobby had stolen a great camera, but that this was confidential. Pat reacted violently; why was she told secrets she was unable to keep? However, she was interested , and decided to lead her own enquiry into this case. Bobby didn't use to commit such acts and the story seemed very strange. Despite Katie's warning, Pat achieved her purpose by carefully questioning her friends, and realized Bobby had been forced to steal this camera or else he would be hurt. Pat knew there was no solving the problem without the the help of adults. Katie and Bobby would be furious, but anyway... She got the two criminals convicted, and recovered the calm  within the school. It was the first time she had saved someone by telling a secret, and she realized she had made a good choice.
We are all looking forward to your answer.
I decided to do something for this man. My first move was to check whether there was any solid or liquid which could have blocked his airways. And I checked his . After that I turned on the car's lights in order to warn the passing cars.
Oh, sorry they were not on this road. They were on the  road.
AS YOU KNOW, I AM A SOUND TECHNICIAN, SO I HELPED THEM TO SET UP THE SOUND EQUIPMENT AND THE INSTRUMENTS PROPERLY. THEN SOME HOURS BEFORE THE CONCERT, I MET THE BAND AND THEY LET ME STAY FOR THE SOUND CHECK. IT WAS A REALLY SPECIAL TIME FOR ME! THE MEMBERS OF THE BAND WERE VERY NICE AND FRIENDLY TO ME.
THEN, WHEN THE CONCERT STARTED, THE ORGANISERS GAVE ME AN IDENTITY CARD, WHICH WAS ONLY FOR MEMBERS OF THE STAFF. THAT CARD WAS THE BEST THING THAT SOMEONE HAD EVER GIVEN TO ME, BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO BE ON THE STAGE WITH THE WHOLE BAND! IT WAS THE BEST TIME OF MY LIFE. I FELT REALLY LUCKY.
Secondly the show was meant to start at 19.30 pm. In fact it started at 20.15 pm without any explanation.
Everything is possible, but it would be fun to see this type of gadget in old clothes, like a dress from the Middle Ages.
Thank you very much for your letter, which informed me that I have won the first prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. Here is some information as requested.
Shopping is an ordinary . We always need fresh food such as vegetables, fruit, milk  etc.  most people will do their shopping twice a week for  fresh food. You might think shopping is enjoyable but I don't think it is always enjoyable. You have to try to park your car first, and sometimes the car parks are full and after you have parked your car and got into the supermarket the product you wanted has run out so you have to change your plan for dinner or go to another supermarket to face a long queue. That makes  which was not fun at all.
Early that day I went to buy the tickets and I decided to buy the expensive ones, as the  said they gave discounts to people who worked at the British Institute. I mentioned it, but they told me that the promotion had ended a long time ago. Why do you put it in the paper then? In the evening I got a flat tire, and because of this I got to the show late, when I got to my seat, it was taken (it cost a lot) and they took me to the cheapest seats, where I couldn't see a thing. After waiting a while in this uncomfortable seat the show started. I waited 45 minutes and then the actors appeared, but I discovered  that the main one wasn't Danny Brook, it was an impostor.
That night I waited until my parents were asleep and I climbed out of my window. I had told Pat to pick me up. She was the only one who knew my plan. I made her promise she wouldn't tell anyone my secret. So when we arrived at the disco there was my guy waiting for me. To summarise the night, I am going steady with him, and he took me home. The next morning Pat came to my house. I was sleeping so she talked to my mom and she suddenly asked her: At what time did Catana arrive home last night?...
I would like to travel to Camp California only in July because during June I am very busy with my exams. I will take the F.C.E at the University of Cambridge and other exams in several subjects at my high school.
Among those activities from which you told me that I have to choose I prefer singing and painting. I have just attended classes in them. My father was a great singer and he has been helping me. Painting is a challenge because it is very hard for me. But I love to paint and I intend to know everything about it.
I am very glad to hear that I have won the prize and thank you very much for that. Here is the information you want, I hope it is useful.
First of all, July is the only month I can travel, because I have got exams at school and I won't finish them until the last day of June. And in August, I have to go back to school to do some class work and I have got a camp to organise. So I would like to travel in July. Secondly, I would prefer the accommodation to be in tents. Since I haven't been camping in tents  I would like to take this chance to feel and experience what it is like.
, I would like to inform you that I attended your new musical show, the name of which is "Over the rainbow", last Saturday evening, 10th June. I'm writing to you to make a complaint about your advertisement, which I consider  a lying advertisement. Let me explain to you why I'm now so disappointed. I had one week's holiday in London with my husband for our honeymoon. We had prepared this quite a long time ago, this trip to the capital and saved a lot of money as well.
Please find enclosed my thoughts about the fashion of the future. First of all, I think we should consider the way people are dressing at present to see how it's going to be developed in the future. Everyone has his own style but it's obvious that many of us are wearing the same clothes as others. We all follow the new collection on the market. Today it's wearing short trousers and yesterday it was wearing torn jeans. What we wear is also influenced by models, the media, or new collections, which come from Paris, London, or New York. These new clothes are often very expensive, which's maybe why not everyone can afford to buy himself the newest clothes on the market. In 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create their own clothes.
Finally, concerning the price of the weekend tickets, I think it is excellent because people are less stressed, because they can visit for longer. It would be better if we could hold this festival at the end of summer. I hope I have given you enough information.
It began when my parents and I were going to the South of France for our holidays. We went  by car. When we were near Geneva, my father, who was driving the car, was flashed by a radar and the police stopped him. After that, as he had been driving for a long time,  we decided to stop at a service area. We went to the toilet and ate something in the snack bar. Suddenly, my father realised he had forgotten to lock the car. He ran but it was too late, somebody had stolen the luggage. We called the police but they said to us that if we didn't lock our car they couldn't do anything.
Secondly, the advertising states  the musical starts at 14.30 and 19:30, but the musical started at 20:15. That's 45 minutes late, and also I asked for a discount ticket at the ticket counter, but no discount tickets were available.
Dear Sir/Madam; I am writing to complain about the musical  "Over The Rainbow", which was performed at your theatre. Firstly, I had been looking forward to that show since Danny Brook was to be one of the main actors; however, there was another actor instead of him, which was a great disappointment to me. Secondly, as for the times of the performance, instead of 19.30 it  started at 20:15, which meant being stranded at the theatre for such a long time. In addition, I had brought very little money in the hope that I would get a discount. However, there was not any available. Finally, as regards the theatre restaurant, it was closed due to problems with the pipes. As you may realize, it was not a perfect evening out but a complete disaster. I am asking you for a full refund or at least some of my money back. I look forward to hearing from you, Yours faithfully ANDREHI LISA DANZELLI
Needless to say, I couldn't put up with that situation any longer so I decided to fall out with her. Since then, I haven't talked to her again, despite the fact that she regretted doing all that and really wanted to make up with me. , I became aware of her feelings since a friend of mine overheard a conversation between Pat and another girl. In spite of that, I found it difficult to forgive her as she had hurt my feelings; that's why the only thing I could tell her after we had quarrelled was: "It serves you right, I'll hate you for the rest of your life!"
I am really happy to get such wonderful news from you. In order to claim the prize, I would like to travel, if it is possible, in July because I am a student and my summer break is  during that month, July.
I would prefer to stay in a cabin because I have not really had good experiences of camping in tents. Last time a bear came inside while I was in the tent. I love sports so I would like to play some basketball at the camp. By the way, my team and I won the last school championship. I play guard on my team. I also like tennis but I am not very good. I was wondering if you could give me some lessons while I am there.
This activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have developed such an instinct for shopping that we can proudly say that we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle.
But where is the bad part of it? Well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example, when hundreds of people go to the shopping centre and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
About accommodation at Camp California, I would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when I am in a tent I feel closer to nature.
First of all, I think that technology has been one of the most important inventions in human history and that without it we couldn't be where we are right now.
I would like to do singing and swimming. Regarding the first activity, I must tell you that I am very keen on singing but that I have very little experience in it.
Concerning swimming, I do this sport once a week by myself, so I am just an amateur, not a great swimmer!
But technology doesn't only make my life better. By  using  a car I  not only get an easy way to move around, but I also destroy the environment. Also, if I use the car for small distances when I could go on foot, I  my health.
Technology is very important in my life. It makes my life easier, and it would be much more difficult to live without it.
I am writing to you to complain about the musical show which took place  last 1st of May at "the Circle Theatre" in London. Your show was supposed to be one of the best that I had ever seen. At first sight the theatre was gorgeous. I was surprised at its facade and also I was anxious to see the beginning of the performance.
Although we had problems at the entrance with the tickets, we looked forward to a marvellous night. The prices that our travel agency confirmed for us were not the same as the ones charged at the theatre. We asked for our special discount for being students of less than eighteen years but we only obtained a rude answer from the woman who sold the tickets.
On top of everything the restaurant was closed and we could not eat at the theatre.
Nowadays we think of  modern technology as something usual in our lives.
For instance with the arrival of the Internet, the new digital television and the researchers in  medicine, we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a button, or look for something new by only thinking about it... we realize that the new technology  has just begun to advance, and it is likely in a few years we will be very advanced in this way.
But however it is a good idea to spend our money on  new enterprises which pay  researchers  who could investigate how we could improve ourselves.
I asked about the discounts available as we were a group of 15 people, but the answer I was given was that nobody had ever heard of them.
Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement promised and that we all wanted turned out to be  regrettable because of the wasted money. That's why I'd like to ask if you could give me some money back. I'm enclosing my ticket and this list of complaints  some money.
Thanks to my mobile phone I can go out  later at night, as my parents can know where I am whenever they want. Also, with the development of the Internet and its arrival at a great number of homes, I can have any information I need at any time I want.
In brief, I am making the most of the discoveries of science and technology and I can't conceal that I'm really glad of that.
If it is possible I would like to travel in July because school is finishing on the 28th June and I have already accepted a job for August.
At the Camp I'd like to do climbing and golf. I belonged to a climbing club at my high school and I've got a lot of knowledge from my experienced teacher. I often climbed mountains when I was in high school. My golf teacher is my father and I've only played in a practising centre, but my father and his friends say I have good talent for golf.
There are a lot of differences between the details of the musical show in the advertisement and . Firstly the stars in the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, while there were different actors in the musical show. Secondly  at 19:30 on the leaflet but it actually started at 20:15. Thirdly it said there were discounts available in the advertisement. However, there were not any at all. Finally it said we could visit your theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because .
It said in the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all. I felt very disappointed after seeing the music show in your theatre. , I want to ask for my money back! I look forwards to hearing from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He was so kind that he couldn't resist telling Janet that she was going to be killed by Mr Brown. After doing that, Pat left the room. Janet was so nervous that she couldn't stop her heart beating quickly. She went downstairs quietly and closed the door as soon as she went into her room. At that moment a lot of things appeared in her mind, which seemed like they had just happened yesterday. "Why did Mr Brown want to kill me?" she said to herself. "I am just a servant in this castle. I love him so much and I don't want anything from him although he is the owner of this castle." It seemed as if a shadow came in through the window and disappeared quickly. Everything in the room was quiet except the sound of the clock, as if everything was going to die. She was so frightened and sad that she had no energy. She fell  onto the floor and wept, while nobody could help her.
I am Writing this letter to express my dissatisfaction with your show.
Furthermore, no discounts were available, even though we had a student card. In the advertisement they said that ticket discounts were available. I think it is a . Anyway I was so unhappy. It was not a marvellous evening. Could you return my money please? You have a responsibility to the audiences.
If I were addicted to the Internet, it would be a problem. I do not want to spend much time on computers.
And you need some information from me. About when would I like to go, I think I would love to go in July, because it is a good time for camping and the weather is lovely at this time of the year.
And the most important reason is because I am still a student. And I study at London International School. So July is my end of year holiday. So I would be happy to go in July. And about the accommodation at camp, I would like to stay in a tent because it has more of a feeling of the adventure that's called camping. And in the letter that you sent to me you also want me to choose two activities to do while I am at the camp. So I will choose two activities that I am good at and not good at. The first one is the one that I am good at and it is Basketball. I usually play basketball at school and play for the school team. And the second activity is the one that I am not good at and I have never tried  before is surfing. I would love to try surfing because it is a very interesting sport and uses a lot of power and energy so now is the end of the letter. And I want to know more about the money. Can you give me more information about the money that I need to bring with me?
I want to ask you to come to our party and also to help us with what present we should buy for Mr. Brown.
I live in Greece, and to be exact on an island, so I know very well what summer means. It means swimming at the wonderful beaches, tasting the delicious food and having a wonderful time every day and every night with your friends.
Also it means meeting other people, having fun together, travelling to all the places on the island. I think that the summer makes people feel great, have fun, enjoy themselves. I believe that the summer is a season for everybody who wants to have a wonderful time and wonderful memories wherever they go.
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I was reading when I suddenly heard a big bang. I looked out through the window and saw a big strange "thing". It looked like a floating potato, a brown potato. After that a being climbed out of the potato. It looked at me and said.
I went back to my chair and when I looked up I saw my head teacher walking through the door with the being behind him. The being moved its hand forward and.....
I am writing to thank you for the interesting and excellent programme that you have organised, and especially for the opportunity to visit the National Art Gallery and the Science Museum.
Peter, my husband, was a tall, strong man in his mid-forties. We used to recount our day before falling asleep. As a postman, Peter had to deliver letters around our little village. He knew everybody, including Mrs Rilke, an elderly, eagle-eyed retired teacher, who lived in an old cottage with her five bad-tempered dogs. She had never received any letters, till that morning.
I received your letter. I do not want to keep you curious any longer. The opportunity of being able to help in the concert knocked on my door by chance. I heard they were looking for volunteers to help at the pop concert. I, of course, jumped at it. The idea of meeting a pop singer known worldwide just made my heart punch my ribcage. The concert  was already filled up with thousands of , although it was really early. We, the volunteers, first unravelled the cables, and set up the microphones and some instruments. Then we were told go   backstage and make sure everything was perfect. After a fantastic concert, I actually had the chance to meet Britney Spears. She is a very nice person. I managed to scavenge an autograph for you as well, I will put it in the envelope.
I am writing to you because my class want to give a surprise birthday party for your husband Mr Brown. We need your help with the details.
Family life nowadays is very important because both  parents work and they haven't any time for the children. In addition children have so many lessons at school that they don't have enough spare time to see their parents, when they are at home.
In spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together. Parents play with their children and have fun. And the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is the only month I have holidays in.
I'M WRITING THIS LETTER BECAUSE TWO WEEKS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I WENT TO THE THEATRE TO SEE YOUR MUSICAL SHOW. AND THROUGH SEEING IT MY FAMILY HAD A VERY DISAPPOINTING EVENING AND SO DID I . YOU CAN READ BELOW MY POINT OF VIEW REGARDING THIS.
ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE BAD BECAUSE WE NEEDN'T GO OUT  TO DO  IMPORTANT THINGS AND BECAUSE OF IT WE DON'T MEET NEW PEOPLE AND  WE HAVE LESS CONTACT WITH  PEOPLE.
I am very happy to answer your letter, which I received this morning. I am very excited by the wonderful news.
Well, I am starting to make a plan for my trip, and the only time I have is in July because I will have finished my language course at St Jame's School.
I am very happy to have the opportunity to do some sports. I'm very good at swimming and surfing. I won last summer's swimming competition in the school. Although I'm not very good at surfing I like it, and I always practise on my holidays every year.
It's wonderful that you are going to attend a pop concert. I'm sure you will  enjoy it. You asked me to tell you about my experience helping at the concert last week.
Well, let me tell you, first of all I was very nervous. You know it was my first time at such an event. I was asked to put all the chairs in order for the singer. This was only in the beginning. After that I needed to check all the microphones. However, I was not very sure  I enjoyed this. After that all the singers arrived and I was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to drink. You can imagine how excited I was, especially because I always wanted some photographs of them and this was a special moment and I realised I hadn't brought my camera. I was very sad.
The discounts weren't available and your theatre restaurant wasn't open because the owners were on holiday.
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Dear Kim: Hi! How are you? How has your family been? I hope you are doing well, I am and so is my family and everything around here. You are not going to believe what happened last month!!! I helped Korn at a concert they had at the Auditorium. I met this guy at a party. His name is Jimme, he is a really nice guy. Maybe you will meet him one day. So, it turned out that Jimme was organizing the concert and he asked me and three of my friends if we wanted to help at the concert. Our job was to make the band feel comfortable and to give them anything they wanted. The guys from Korn were really nice to us and we had a great time with them. We even had our pictures taken with them and they gave us their autographs. It was so much fun, we had a great time that night. Well, I have to go, I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied at all. Please write back. Love, Lolita.
To begin with, in your advertisement you say that Danny Brooks will be starring in the show but instead there was a different actor, which made us very disappointed. Another thing that is said in the advertisement is that the evening show will start at 7:30 but  there was a forty-five minute delay. The crowd got really upset and we were going to leave at the first chance we got.
I and some  friends  decided to go to the theatre to see a musical show. We were so excited. We are on holiday and we decided to go. We had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
I believe  modern technology  has changed everyone, especially now with computers and all the other machines. Personally,  modern technology has changed me a lot. First I want to talk about the computer. Before, I used some other ways to get information or play or communicate with people. Now I can do all this  with the computer. I can spend so many hours because day by day I discover new things. Maybe it is not good because you don't have the opportunity to meet people and talk face-to-face. Apart from computers we have the telephone, TV, and gyms. All of these are  in my life.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the musical show I saw yesterday, called 'Over The Rainbow'.
Peter got very angry and asked Pat why they had said that to him. Pat did not answer  him. The next day all the school knew that Peter was gay and even though he didn't mind what had happened he didn't talk to Pat  again in his life.
The 1st "F" is for "fast food", something fast and , which is an ancient . This is not normally what people wear every day.
This so-called "Perfect Evening" was very disappointing as well as discouraging us from going to the Circle Theatre again.
The biggest achievement of modern technology came into my house as soon as I reached  the age of ten. This achievement is the personal computer, which has grown very fast because of the help it can provide. My computer helps me with my studies, homework and projects for school. With the Internet, I became more sociable using the Relay Chat clients, but also developed a kind of boredom, which is known as "Internet Freak Disease"! I use it a lot, so sometimes I feel pain in my eyes or my hands.
To sum up, my life is  modern gadgets. Sometimes these gadgets are for the best and - more often - for the worst!! It just depends on your judgement and the way you plan  to use technology.
I received your letter, so I am writing to you to give you some information about me.
I would like to travel in July because I finish school in June and I go to Great Britain in August for one month.
At first they didn't talk to each other but yesterday they both took part in a radio programme and she forgave him.
Now Pat is angry with us because we didn't tell her what happened that night, and because she has left her boyfriend. It could have been worse than it was and for this we are happy, but now we can't hide anything from her.
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE NEWS ABOUT MY PRIZE. REGARDING YOUR QUESTIONS I WOULD RESPOND THAT JULY WOULD BE THE MONTH I COULD GO TO THE CAMP,  BECAUSE MY JOB FINISHES AT THE END OF JUNE. THAT WAY I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF TIME AVAILABLE FOR THE CAMP.
TO ANSWER  YOUR NEXT QUESTION, I WOULD RATHER STAY IN A LOG CABIN. THE THING IS, I HAVE A PHOBIA ABOUT INSECTS AND MY DOCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT I SHOULD SLEEP IN AN ENCLOSED AREA.
REGARDING THE QUESTION YOU ASKED ABOUT ACTIVITIES MY ANSWER WOULD BE CLIMBING AND SWIMMING. I CHOOSE THESE TWO ACTIVITIES BECAUSE I USED TO DO THEM A LONG TIME AGO AND BESIDES I WOULD SAY I HAVE THE SKILLS AND ABILITY TO DO THEM.
IT WOULD BE MY SUGGESTION TO THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO THAT THEY SHOULD  FOCUS ON OUR WRITING AND CULTURE LESSONS. FOR CULTURE LESSONS WE DON'T NEED TO GO SO FAR BACK IN TIME; FOR THE LAST 60 YEARS OUR CULTURE HAS BEEN CHANGING ENORMOUSLY AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT COMPUTERS, WARS, CARS, WEAPONS, ETC....
STUDENTS SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR LIVES, SHOULDN'T THEY?
I would like to travel in July because my holidays are only in that month and the weather in California is better then. I am that kind of person who enjoys having a wild and simple life, so I prefer to stay in tents.
About the activities, the first one I would like to do is play basketball, which I have a lot of experience playing. The second one is sailing, but I am not so good at this sport.
In your last letter you said that you want to know about my experience at the pop concert. I enjoyed it very much.  It was great! There I helped with the special effects and the sound. They liked me so much and invited me to be  responsible for the lights and sound. I told them that I will think about it but I believe I will accept the job.
About the things you asked me in your letter, I would like to go to camp California in July because that's the month when term ends and I have my vacations and I think it would be much easier that month. About my accommodation at the camp, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because it's safer than being in a tent and because you sleep more comfortably. The activities that I would like to do are singing, because my friend told me that I'm good at it, and the other activity that I would like to do is climbing because I think it is very exciting although I have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
I just want to ask you about something else. How many jeans, Pants, sweaters etc... do I have to take? And how much money do I need to bring in my pocket?
Dear Kim I'm having a great time here in Brazil, I have been going out with some friends and now I have a girlfriend. She's very nice and very Pretty too. Well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "Los Jagoares", they sing pop music. And they are one of my favourites and as you know I have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me  if I would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and I said, "Sure man." That night I went to the stadium and I met the singer. His name is saul HernaÃ±dez and he is very funny. That night I had a lot of fun with them and of course I was in the first row at the concert. It was the best day of my life. I hope you are having fun and that you are OK. Your friend Henrique.
"Over the Rainbow" was supposed to start at seven thirty. We went there on time. We waited there for forty-five minutes for it to start! We couldn't believe it. We really got bored, like all the other people there.
The party will be organised on Tuesday the 16th of June at three to six pm in the college canteen. We will have food and drink and we will have music because we know that Mr Brown loves music. His students, the teachers and the principal will come to the party. My last question is about a present. My fellow students have suggested buying a CD or a book. We would like you to tell us which is the best present for him.
At that moment we saw the bus come, it stopped and one man came and sat near  us. I  recognised him. He was my father. I couldn't believe it. I had not seen him for five years. I thought that I was dreaming but I wasn't. It was true; my father had come to his country after five years.
As requested, I have chosen two activities - sailing and surfing. I am quite experienced at surfing - I have participated in some competitions - whereas I am not at all experienced at sailing.
I would like know if I need any particular clothes or if there could be any extra expenses for the camp. Also, I would like to know if there is going to be a qualified instructor for activities since I am a beginner at sailing as mentioned before.
Because you are the manager of the theatre, you have to know about the problems which it has.
Every summer I go abroad with my family. We can see new countries, learn about their history etc. With my computer (and the Internet) I can speak to my friends wherever they are.
The leisure activities sound fantastic, especially climbing and photography. I'm very keen on climbing. I joined a climbing club in my town for 2 years ago and have reached the top of several middle-high mountains. The other activity I would like to try is photography. I have no previous experience of it but I want  to learn a lot.
Why don't we include some sports, for example, volleyball? The team has been training very hard during the last weeks. And they'll certainly feel very proud of being in the video.
The music lessons and the singing club in the afternoon are very popular among  students from all courses. Practically the whole school would appear on the video.
In the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what I did, but when I got there it was shut for no reason.
I would prefer staying in a tent during the two weeks because I think a tent is . A log cabin doesn't sound like a camping holiday. It sounds like a summer holiday on the coast of Italy.
From the activities you've offered I want to do golf and surfing. I've never done either in my life, so I am a complete beginner at playing golf and at surfing. But the reason I want to try these two activities is their image. Golf is played by wealthy people, a town's upper class, and surfing sounds like freedom.
Dear Sir: I am writing this letter to you because I would like you to know about a musical show which I went to see at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I wanted to see this musical 'Over the Rainbow' because the actor Danny Brook was acting in it. But when the musical started I became very disappointed because Harry Smythe, a not very famous actor, was acting instead of Danny Brook. Then, the musical didn't start on time. It was supposed to start at 19.30 pm in the evening but we had to wait for more than half an hour. All the people got very angry. Also I bought a Â£20 ticket because  the advertisement for the show said that discounts were available for Â£10 Â£15, Â£20 tickets. I couldn't have my ticket discounted because when I went to buy it they told me that was untrue. Furthermore,  the advertisement said that the theatre restaurant was open but when we went there after the show, it was closed because the the restaurant chef was ill. It was ridiculous! In conclusion, I didn't have my perfect evening out, in other words, I had a very disappointing evening so I am asking you for my money back. I would like to have my money back in ten days, otherwise, I will have to sue you. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours sincerely,
I am writing to you to complain about the Play you are advertising as the "London's Newest and Best Musical Show" in newspapers and leaflets. To tell you the truth, it has been the most disappointing experience of my whole life. I cannot bear it when somebody says something and then does just the opposite .
The last thing I would like to complain about is that the Theatre Restaurant was closed, because, as we were told, of "VACATIONS". If  the advertisements and leaflets say "VISIT OUR THEATRE RESTAURANT AFTER THE SHOW" there is no reason for it being closed. It should be open at least until everyone gets out of the place. It must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
First, we have to admit that technology has really increased our ability to communicate, to travel and to get information. You can now know what is happening on the other side of the world at the same time as it is happening. What is more, you can get the information you need in just one second by pressing the "enter" key on a computer.
Your letter also mentioned some kind of activities in which we can get involved during the camp. I would like to choose painting and photography which are my favourite ones. I have recently finished a three-year course in painting and I have always been fascinated by  photography.
 I would also like to know about some further details like whether we need to bring some clothes with us or whether they will be provided for us and if we need some money in case we have to buy something.
Although I found the ticket's price much too expensive I thought that there would be some discounts available, but there were not. As a conclusion to that horrible evening I decided to visit your theatre restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when I found it closed.
One day as I was talking with my teacher about the project I saw what  could be the final answer sheet to the exam on the top of his desk. , when the teacher went out of his office, I quickly copied the answers into my notebook. I couldn't believe it. This would be the easiest exam I would do. As I went out of the office I found Pat, my best friend, walking down the corridor. As she was also doing the project I decided to let her copy the answers. I told her she mustn't talk about it to anybody. She agreed and went home very happy. When night came I couldn't believe what was happening. Almost all my classmates were at the front door of my house asking me if I had the answers to the exam. I couldn't believe that my best friend had told everybody about my secret.
On the exam day everybody answered every question correctly. And after having corrected all of them, our teacher told us we had to repeat the exam because he realised we knew what the answers were.
Finally I would like to do basketball and swimming, because in my school I used to do those sports a lot. I still do so even now at a sports center, but not much.
Nowadays most  people are attracted to shopping centers, which are not always enjoyable. So, I have some opinions about this, which I would like to tell.
First of all, I think people have to be careful about the things that they buy because probably  are not  good quality, which is very annoying.
Secondly, people have to look after their money in the shops, and not spend it on  things that they don't need, because by the end of the month they won't have any money.
Finally I think the shops' products are  good quality and reasonably priced, but sometimes the shop's staff is not very friendly to you. I don't think it's very nice to buy  things there, with these people.
Unfortunately your advertisement for it wasn't true!
Firstly, it was written that Danny Brook would be performing in it, but in fact he wasn't. I was very disappointed when I saw someone I've never heard of . In addition to this, the time, 19.30, wasn't correct. We wasted our time waiting outside in the cold until  the doors  opened 45 minutes late.
Secondly as a student I was hoping to get a discount. Again, it wasn't true. When I enquired about the discounts, with the cashier, they told me that they didn't have any information about them.
Anyway, shopping is not always enjoyable as the title states because firstly you will get tired because you have to walk in and out the shops. Secondly you will get angry at the bad manners of the assistants in the shop. Thirdly, if you're fat you won't find your size. Fourthly, that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself.
. Moreover, the show was awful. I like Danny Brook and Tina Truelove's acting but the actors were changed without mentioning, also the restaurant was closed with the excuse that it was being repaired. In fact, the notice had been displayed since last winter. It means that the theatre have not made any efforts for the people.
Considering my experience, it was not. I am expecting a full refund and compensation for the discomfort I have suffered. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Thank you very much for the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the USA. In the following there is some further information from me.
I would like to answer your questions about this trip. First of all, I'm living in Leeds and also studying English at a college. Therefore, I need to wait until my college's lessons have finished. If  possible  I would prefer to come in July. Before now, I have usually stayed in log cabins, but I have never had the chance  to stay in a tent. In my opinion, staying in  tents is more exciting than staying in  log cabins. That's why I would love to live in a tent for 2 weeks!
In addition, I've just learnt from your letter that I can do some sporting activities during the camp. I'm very happy about thisbecause I spent most of my school life playing  sports, especially  basketball. But, after starting to work, I haven't had any opportunity  to play basketball. Now, you are giving me an opportunity. As  my second activity, I would like to choose photography, because my education  included photography. I love taking  photographs of nature.
Meanwhile, I'd like to ask you some questions. When I come, what kind of clothes would I be able to wear  there? And also,  how much money do you think I'll need  for two weeks? I'm looking forward to your answers.
As you know, I was there to help with the  running of the concert and there were a lot of different things to do.
Furthermore, I had to make announcements over the loudspeaker for the children who were lost.
But the most amazing thing happened later, when, ten minutes before the concert began, my friend told me we could see it from backstage. For a while I thought it was a dream. The music was excellent, the audience enjoyed it very much but, above all, I was there,  ten metres from my favourite group. I even got a few friendly words from the singer on a piece of paper: I hope you've enjoyed it. And his signature. I'll always treasure it.
First of all, on the ticket  it says that the actor was Danny Brook and really he was not. A different actor appears in the show, so I was very disappointed.
Then, on the ticket it says that the show starts at 19.30 and, I don't know why, it started at 20:15, very impolite on your part, and, also, you wasted my time.
The other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when I asked about it, there were none.
The second thing is that it has made my life easier. communication over the world is faster than ever, so when I need something, I can have it in only a minute. It has allowed me to worry about other things in my life.
It would be interesting to film a math lesson. As it is very boring, everybody would understand how difficult it is to get good marks in the final examination.
First of all, we went to the theatre to pick up our tickets. We were thinking we would get a discount on our tickets, because we had  read this in the advertisement but they didn't discount the prices so we had to pay the full price for the show. We were ready for the show at 19.30. We sat in our seats and waited for the show but it didn't start on time, it started at 20.15 which was a ridiculous time. We waited for 45 minutes.
Finally, we had a totally miserable night at your show. You can't take this bad feeling away but you might give us our money back. This would be the first good thing for us to come from your show.
On the other hand, they use all this too much. For example the mobile phone: people talk on it on the street, in the car, almost everywhere. Some of them because they need to, some of them not. They are just wasting time on it. They don't even think how they make the communication lines  busy. How many people are on the phone at the same time? Too many.
Anyway, technology is the most important thing in our life. It develops day by day. The problem is, do we really use it properly or not?
Those who need to travel in order to do business with other people abroad can fly by plane and arrive at their destination safely or have their problems solved via telephone.
Actually, I'd prefer to travel in July, because I'm working at the moment for a company, and I'll only have two weeks off,  the period between the fifteenth and the thirtieth of July. I'd love to come earlier, but I really can't because this job is very important to me, and I'll need it as  work experience for my further studies at  University.
But shopping is not always enjoyable. Especially if you go with women or children to the shops. That is my worst nightmare. I never go shopping with women,  especially with my mother or my sisters. And that's because they spend hours trying on all kinds of clothes, everything you can imagine, and at the end they do not buy anything. They also like going to loads of shops, in different parts of the city. At the end I feel very tired and angry, because I have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except for looking at them trying on different clothes, and that's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's really annoying.
Firstly, I'd like to travel in July because I've already registered on another summer course which starts at the end of July. Sorry about that but I can make that trip only in July.
A school teaches you how to be polite and respectful. The cafeteria is an interesting place to go because one can see if students respect food and if they remain polite towards each other. It is important to remember that close-ups should be taken of each subject.
My name is Paula and I'm one of your most recent visitors to your show "Over the Rainbow'', this is also the reason for my letter.
The first disappointment confronted us at the main entrance; there was no discount for our tickets available. Despite  this we were still  looking forward to the show and Danny Brook.
I would like to travel in July, please, because that is when I am on vacation. That is really the only time I have, unfortunately.
About the activities listed in your letter, I choose basketball and singing. I have played basketball for six years, and I've been in competitions for five years. I have good singing skills too. I have sung in the church's choir for three years, and I have had singing classes at school since first grade. I have recorded a demo tape, which I can send to you if you like, in which I also play the guitar.
There was a huge Madonna show in a soccer stadium here in SÃ£o Paulo. The most amazing thing is that I helped at it!
But the unexpected thing was that I actually got to meet Maddy, and talk to her for almost one hour! The Material girl's the sweetest person in the world, totally unlike what the media says about her. Mo' told me everything about her new album, "Music", and how the single of the same name had slipped onto the Internet in the UP3 format. She sang to me part of the album's second single, "How it feels like for a girl"!
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I told her about my plans on Monday. However, on Friday almost half of my class knew what was going on. I was the only boy in my class who didn't have a driving licence. I wanted to tell them about this after I passed the exam. Saturday morning I went to the driving centre for my first lesson. I had never driven a car before. I hoped that nobody was watching me. Unfortunately, Pat was there and half of my class. I felt terrible. The instructor opened the car door and asked me to sit in the driver's seat. It was the worst time I ever had. At the beginning I couldn't start the engine. Then I drove very slowly very often crossing the white line on the road. I looked in the mirror and I saw how my friends were laughing. It made me crazy. I started doing stupid things: turning right instead of left and so on.
I just received your letter with the good news. I am very happy about winning the first prize in your competition and I am glad to tell you that I am planning to go, but I can only travel in July because I have to work until the end of June.
Regarding the accommodation, I would like to have a log cabin rather than a tent because two weeks is quite a long time and I think they are more comfortable and give you more privacy.
First of all, the show started 45 minutes late. We all had to sit and wait because there was nobody to explain the reason for the delay and apologise about it. If there had been someone to do so, we could have gone out to eat something.
Everybody was given a job, and Pat's job was buying the cake and the candles. The best bakery was on the other side of the town so there was no danger of him seeing Alison and revealing the party.
He went out of his house and got on his bike to go to the bakery. On his way he saw lots of places he could have bought the birthday cake but knowing that the safest one was the one which was  the handiest for Alison's house, he kept on riding.
Secondly, It was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15. Yes, 45 minutes! I want to see you in that position. What would you do? I felt like a fool, and all the audience felt as I did.
And well, don't talk about the discounts, because they didn't exist. More than that, the restaurant was closed because it was under repair.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, because one day when Maria, her sister, was walking to  school, a car stopped beside her and a man said, "I know who is your lover, it's Peter".
Obviously, Pat first denied it, but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologised to Maria. After that Pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission.
This is a great opportunity because we can learn more about leisure and fashion in this city. If you allow us to go we could change the programme in the following way.
If you think of the future you might think of faster and better machines, advanced technology or a better life. All this will happen in the next 50 years, how can we be prepared to receive all these things in our homes?
My last suggestion for next year's festival is to invite some "salsa" bands. It would be great to listen and dance at the same time to "salsa" music.
When it comes to my home, I think I have the usual duties: I have to clean my room, wash the dishes or vacuum the carpets, but they're not exhausting things, as I share them with my sister and brother. Furthermore, my parents aren't demanding: I have to be home by 11 o'clock at the latest and tell them where I am going .
I AM WRITING  WITH REFERENCE TO THE LONDON TRIP WE ARE MAKING VERY SOON.
I AM WRITING ON BEHALF OF MY GROUP, AND ALL OF US WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR TAKING US ABROAD.
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR ANSWER.
I WAS LIVING QUITE CLOSE TO PORTOBELLO ROAD BUT I DIDN'T KNOW THE AREA VERY WELL BECAUSE ALL THE TIME I JUST HAD TO GET OFF AT THE CORNER OF MY STREET. BUT THAT DAY, AS I WAS KIND OF DRUNK, I DIDN'T REALISE THAT THE BUS TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE. SO, WHEN I NOTICED IT, THE DRIVER WAS ALREADY ASKING ME TO GET OFF, BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE GARAGE IN PORTOBELLO. I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE I WAS, BUT HE JUST SAID SORRY.
HE TOOK ME RIGHT TO THE FRONT OF MY HOUSE. I THANKED HIM VERY MUCH, AND I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I ASKED  THE RIGHT PERSON AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED TO ME.
First of all, from my point of view the festival itself is a wonderful idea. That also goes for the weekend ticket you offer; in addition to being rather cheap, it allowed me to see so many interesting events in such a short time.
I am writing this letter to express my thoughts about the International Art Festival of this year. I was so impressed with the exhibitions at the festival that you organized. Furthermore, it's a worthwhile experience for people who want to know about  other countries' arts.
But I would like to make some requests regarding the festival.
A long long time ago, there were an old man and old woman who lived at the foot of a mountain.
First of all, as you can see Starring was Danny Brook and Tina Truelove in your advertisement but when I sat in my seat, a different actor and actress appeared. I was very disappointed because I was longing  to see them, as a fan. Moreover, the show didn't start in time so I had been waiting for ages.
In addition, when I entered  the theatre I couldn't have a discount in spite of being a student and I couldn't use  your restaurant either after the show. At that time, it was closed because it had been being repaired. It was nonsense, wasn't it?
I am writing an article about the fashion of the future for the international student magazine.
Despite my appreciation of all kinds of sports and activities, I've chosen my favourite ones, which are swimming and tennis. As I was a champion in a swimming competition in Russia in 1997, I'd like to continue to practise my skills. Also I like to play tennis, which is a beautiful "game" itself and good for the figure.
"Is shopping always enjoyable for you or not" - my English teacher has asked me in the class discussion about shopping.
Sincerely, I must admit that I don't like shopping in supermarkets and big stores. There are always too many people there. As I'm not keen on being a part of the crowd, I prefer a calm atmosphere in more isolated small shops. Furthermore, it takes too long to find something you need in unfamiliar stores.
I am happy to receive it. Of course I will able to go to Camp California in the U.S.A. However, I will only be able to go to there in July 2001 because I have a job which is extremely busy work. Our department, which is the sales department, have to make good sales results before the end of June because of the financial month. So, if I can choose days, I would like to go to the U.S.A in July 2001. About accommodation, I prefer to stay in log cabins because I don't like to stay in tents which are uncomfortable for me. I am also not keen on preparing it.
Finally, I have some questions. When I join this camp, what kind of clothes should I carry? Also, how much money do I  need? Please reply to me as soon as possible
Hello Kim. How are you? I am well. I have  big news. I could enjoy helping at a pop concert  last week which is "The Max". As you know, I am a big fan of "The Max". Can you believe it?
I have got good experience and fantastic memories. At the same time, I have got a small amount of money, but it was not important to me. I was so happy.
Hello! I am very pleased that I have won the first prize in your competition and I want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your Camp in July because that month I usually have a rest and now I am thinking about it. So your advice about going to a camp suits me very well.
Now let me tell you about my sports preferences. From your list of activities I have chosen swimming and surfing, because all of us came out from the water and we have to go back there. Of course it was a joke, but as I have chosen swimming and surfing I will tell you why. I have chosen them because I am applying to do a masters in sports in water polo. And , but also because I like water very much.
As a student in the economics form I think I should tell you about one day in the timetable of our form. For example Tuesday. On Tuesday we have these lessons: English, Maths, Economics and Physics. All of these subjects are so important for us that we have never missed them, especially English and Economics because we are going to become famous economists.
I am writing to you about  the festival.
I believe there should be more plays and films  next year and the stars and artists should be from around the world.
One reasonably-priced  ticket for all events was excellent because it's always busy at the weekend and people prefer to go any weekday.
In my country's schools we are not allowed to have an argument with classmates and are not allowed to eat in class. We can't listen to music in class either. We always have to keep everywhere clean, but these kinds of rules are not very strict I believe.
I am writing to you in reply to your letter, which  let me know I am the winner of the first prize in your competition.
First of all, I am very happy to spend two weeks at Camp California in the USA. Yet, I could only travel in July because I am a student and so my holidays begin in July.
To conclude, in this short video, we must show that thanks to our school we are able to bring out the best in ourselves.
On the evening I spent in your theatre, I was supposed to see "Over the rainbow" (as you wrote on the flyer).
However, it was  not as you described!
First, there was a big delay with the performance. The show began 45 minutes later than expected!
I think we have to take our environment into consideration:  pollution makes the atmosphere warmer and warmer. In fact, winters will be rare or will maybe even disappear. The ice will melt, the weather will be warmer.
Community: another very important point! The electronic community  in our  lifestyle. We will see  objects  become smaller. So small that I can not imagine, they will be introduced (maybe like chips) into our clothes.
Our feelings will be transmitted electronically through our clothes to other people. I think of an internet. "The Internet on our body".. I'm sure that is not impossible!
Unfortunately I have to suggest a change for the programme for Tuesday the 14th of March. That's because the "Fashion and Leisure Show" takes place that day in London. All of the students - including myself - think of this as a great opportunity that it would be a pity to miss, especially when students can enter for free.
According to the day's programme, we are visiting the Science Museum in the morning and we are going shopping in the afternoon. My suggestion is to use Wednesday's afternoon free time as an alternative  to the shopping. This way we will be able to visit the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday evening, and see the show.
I'm a student at your college and I am writing this letter for my class because I'm the class chief.
In the hall outside our classroom we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would like to go to the show if that is possible.
As I see from your programme, the shopping trip is at the same time as the London Fashion Show so I'll make you a suggestion: we'll start in the morning with the Science Museum and immediately after we'll go to the Central Exhibition Hall without doing any shopping.
I'm a student in an English class which is going to spend three days in London (13th-14th March) and I'm the student representative from my class  to thank you for the programme that you've  organised for us. It's really wonderful, especially the River trip to Greenwich. We feel we can't wait until that time.
To make matters worse, despite the fact that the second show of the day was scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m., it started at 8:15 p.m. What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed, because the chef suddenly took a day off. On top of everything, although your advertisement told me that I would receive some discounts, there were no discounts available.
I was really disappointed with your show. I expect a full refund plus compensation for my dissatisfaction and the discomfort which I suffered. I look forward to receiving your response within the next seven days.
All the students have seen an advertisement for that and they would like to go to the show. I think that will be a very good event, especially the part about the Latest Fashions, because it is something which affects  people of all ages today.
But also the other parts of the show seem to be very interesting. Leisure and Sports Wear is very interesting. I think that young people are affected by that in the way they dress.
Make-up and Hairstyles are also very important, especially For our class, because  most of the students in our class are girls. The girls are more interested than boys in make-up and hairstyles and they want to know all the latest news about these things.
I think that they have a right because they are also people like you or like me and they should have a private life. A private life is very important for everyone, because your job creates  stress and you should rest and recharge your batteries For the next day.
On the other hand, I believe that Journalists are doing their job, but sometimes they try to impress their boss and they are always following  Famous people in order to discover something new about their lives.
Last week I received your letter in which you told me that I won first prize. I am writing in response to it.
First of all, I would like to travel in July, because I can arrange 2 weeks in July during my school holidays, in order not to miss classes.
You told me to choose 2 activities and I chose surfing and singing. I am very good at both of them. I did a surfing course last summer and I have gone to singing lessons almost all my life.
ENGLISH: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
So I phoned her and told her the whole story. Last weekend at the Local Festival, which is held every year in our Town, I was walking with my little sister, who is three years old. She started running and got lost. So while I was looking for her I saw the Director of my school, Mr Smythe, stealing money from a small shop. I could not believe my eyes! When Mr Smythe saw me there, he told me: "If you say a word you're going to be in serious trouble."
But Pat could not resist the temptation  to call the police. We were at school when she told me this and Mr Smythe went to our class and said to me, "May I talk to you?". At that moment I felt so nervous and terrified that I fainted.
The two activities I would like to choose are photography and surfing. I never really got any practice in photography. Yes I have taken some holiday pictures but I would like to learn more about this. So I am not very good at photography.
I am sure you will understand my request regarding my complaint, your credibility is depending on it.
Every day, from the morning to the evening we are completely dependent on  technology.
A good example is the cellular phone. I can contact my family without any problem, I can inform my company if I have an accident in my car.
I am writing with reference to the three-day trip to London. Thank you very much for organising the programme, which seems extremely interesting. In particular, the sightseeing by bus should be enjoyable.
Therefore, I wonder if we could possibly change the programme slightly on 14th March. We would like to see the show on Tuesday afternoon, instead of shopping. We can go shopping on Wednesday afternoon during our free time.
I am Carlos Gregore and during my last holiday I stayed in London for a week. It was then I read the advertisement for the show at your theatre and I decided to see it.
So I decided to write you this letter to complain about the inaccurate information and to ask for a refund for the price of the ticket or a part of that. I hope you read this and write to me to let me know something about my money
I think  modern technology is very important in my life. I also think I am lucky, because I live in a period of technological boom.
My daily life should be changed by these innovations! In the present day, for example, a lot of people have a personal computer at home, and a very large proportion of those also have the Internet, the new frontier of computer evolution.
If I look back to the past I  find that the computer is following the same route as television, the telephone and a lot of other things that now the largest part of the population have at home.
. I'M AFRAID I CAN ONLY GO IN JULY BECAUSE DURING THAT MONTH I WILL HAVE MY SCHOOL HOLIDAYS, SO THAT WILL BE FOR ME THE ONLY CHANCE OF TAKING 2 WEEKS OFF.
. THE KIND OF ACCOMMODATION I PREFER IS  A TENT BECAUSE AT  SUMMER CAMP I FIND IT MORE INTERESTING SLEEPING OUTSIDE UNDER THE SKY WHEN THE WEATHER IS NICE AND WARM.
. THERE ARE TWO ACTIVITIES I WOULD LIKE TO DO: BASKETBALL AND PAINTING. I'M QUITE GOOD AT PLAYING BASKETBALL BECAUSE I USED TO PLAY FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS AT SCHOOL. WE USED TO HAVE TRAINING SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK AND AT LEAST TWO GAMES A MONTH AGAINST ANOTHER SCHOOL, WHICH WAS GREAT. PAINTING ALWAYS DID FASCINATE ME, EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT SO GOOD AT IT, BUT MY FRIENDS  SAY I CAN REALLY PAINT AND THEY LOVE THE THINGS I DO. THE TECHNIQUE I LIKE THE MOST IS WATERCOLOURS.
THEN CAME THE GUY WHO INSTALLED THE SOUND EQUIPMENT (CABLES, BOXES, WIRES, ETC) AND IT WAS VERY INTERESTING SEEING HIM AT WORK. EVERYTHING HAD TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE, PERFECTLY INSTALLED AND PROTECTED, TO AVOID ACCIDENTS.
AT ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK EVERYTHING WAS READY AND THE BAND CAME ON. THERE WERE ALREADY PLENTY OF FANS WAITING FOR THE CONCERT TO BEGIN, WHICH STARTED AT 7 O'CLOCK. I KNOW THE MUSICIANS FROM  SCHOOL , WHICH IS WHY IT WAS EVEN MORE FUN TO HELP AND TO TAKE PART IN THIS EVENT, SPECIALLY BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE THE MUSIC THEY PLAY.
My name is Gabriel and I represent our class. We have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would particularly like to go to the show. As representative of my class may I kindly ask you to partially change your plan for our visit to London?
 Monday 13 March will be . The morning  visiting interesting places in the City and in the afternoon  make a trip to Greenwich, which is excellent.
I knew I couldn't swim so I realized it might be dangerous for me as well. But at this particular moment it wasn't important to me. The most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old, who was in the water without his parents and couldn't swim. It was difficult for me because I am afraid of water. However I went quickly to him and took him in my arms. He was exhausted and couldn't breathe. In the meantime a man told me he was a doctor and could help the boy. I was very happy that I managed to save the life of the boy. Now, when I consider  the events, it's clear to me that if I got there a few minutes later it probably would have been too late.
Well, I hope you found my suggestions reasonable as I deeply congratulate you on the great success of the festival.
As regards the time that I can travel, I must tell you that my holidays at university are only in July. I hope that it won't be a problem for you and that I can go to the Camp California at some time in July. I would like to stay in a log cabin as I have an allergy to grass.
Finally, I also have some questions for you. Firstly I would like to know what kind of clothes will be appropriate for the camp, secondly how much money I should take with me for the two weeks and lastly if there are any facilities for cooking.
Having finally decided and got what you wanted , the next torture comes at the cash desk, when you have to pay. You have to wait in a long queue for more than 15 minutes.
I am writing to suggest a few things that could be changed or added to next year's International Arts Festival, which in my opinion has been a great idea .
I had a good time at the jazz, rock and classical concerts in spite of the fact that some concert halls were too small. I think that if you want to enjoy music you must be comfortable. All my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but I personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
In your letter you asked me something about rules. I imagine that you want my opinion on your homework , don't you?
I am writing with reference to the programme for the English class that is going to spend three days in London. I have already read the programme, and I like it, I think that the class will like going  sightseeing by bus and in the afternoon going on the river trip to Greenwich. Also, they can visit the Science Museum, and they can go   shopping. On Wednesday 15 March they are going to visit the National Art Gallery, really, I think that is a good programme.
The first thing that disappointed me was the star. I expected to see Danny Brook because on the paper that you gave to me it was written that Danny Brook was coming but there was a different actor. Then you wrote that it started at 19.30 but it started at 20:15. You wrote that discounts were available but they were not available. You wrote  "visit our restaurant after the show" so I didn't eat my supper, to eat at your restaurant, but the restaurant was closed because the show started at 20:15 and finished at 00.15 and the restaurant was open until 00.00. Finally you wrote that it would be "your perfect evening out" but after all these problems how would you expect me to have a perfect evening out?
The reality was that Marine's parents were not her real parents, they found her in their house's garden. They tried so many things to find her family. For a year they did everything to find her family but they couldn't find them. In this one year they spent most of their time with Marine and they loved her so much and they wanted to be her parents. When Marine was three years old a man came to their house and said that he was Marine's father and he wanted to take her, and he added that he left Marine because her mother died two days after Marine's birth and the police thought Marine's father did this so they put him in prison. He had nobody that he could give Marine to so he left her in their garden.  Marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved Marine so much. They gave a lot of money to Marine's real father to keep her. After that Marine's father took the money & left her. The couple couldn't tell the truth to Marine because they were afraid of losing her.
After I told Pat the truth Pat said this to Marine. Marine said to Pat  "I knew that because I talk to my real father every month but my parents don't know that because I am waiting for them to tell me the truth".
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Pat is one of my colleagues from the office. She works with me. We get on very well. She is a single mum. She always talks about her private life to me, and I thought we understood each other, because when I talked about my private life to her, she seemed very understanding.
Yesterday morning, I went to the toilet. I overheard two people talking about my son. I felt sorry for myself and I burst into tears. I quickly got out of the toilet. I don't remember how I finished work that day.
I went to London for a week of "pure holiday", thinking I would have some fun going to see your musical show.
In the advertisement it was written that Danny Brook would be there too. (I like him very much and, frankly, I came to the theatre just to see him)
In the end, I asked for I money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will give me something back?!
I hope, that in the future, you will understand that it isn't right to write false things in an advertisement.
Science and technology characterize our modern society. They have made  big progress in our everyday life and they are always becoming more important for us. If you think that fifty years ago, when there weren't cars or any sort of comforts (born just in the "industrial age") everything had to be done by hand or by animal labour: I think at that time life was really much harder than now! We have to say that technological advances have given our society "their good fruits" but, at the same time, they have negative aspects too. Walking on a city street, it's difficult to find parks or "green" places with trees and clean air: actually pollution, traffic and noise are the main problems of our society. I know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily I think I couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... But, sometimes I ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than  our one.
As I'm an art student at a particular College, I can only go to  Camp California in July, because in that month I haven't got any classes, and I'm free to do whatever I want to. I'd like a log cabin for my accommodation, because it's safer and cleaner than a tent and I wouldn't share it with anyone.
Painting and Photography are  good activities for me. They suit me because my art work develops  in these areas. Through Painting I talk about human beings in this world, on big canvases; and through Photography, in Collages, I talk about anger and guilt in the family line. So at Camp California I would like to keep  in touch with these areas.
I'd like to ask you to send me $1000 for my art knowledge. With this amount I could buy a lot of art books, and records. To summarize, art and music need to be kept with me throughout these two weeks so I do not forget my artistic life.
There is joy in shopping when it is done by ourselves for ourselves. That means buying whatever we like,  like clothes, records, rings, and books. What we like is based on our relationships with other people, at work or in the family. So we have fun when we buy what we like according to other people's views.
On the other hand, sickness in ourselves or our relatives makes us reluctant to shop. It is an obligation to shop for medicines, clothes for winter, doctor's visits, and so forth. A death in the family is also not an enjoyable shopping experience, because it is . Buying coffins and graveyard plots to bury relatives is not as enjoyable as buying clothes.
In summary shopping can be enjoyable or not depending on our state of health. To give examples: if we are healthy we buy clothes and Records, we enjoy ourselves; if we are sick, or our relatives are, we buy medicines and we do not enjoy ourselves because it is an obligation.
Danny Brook is my favourite actor & to see him was my dream since my childhood! It was a surprise when we were told there would be another actor. Also, we expected to get a discount as  students, but international students cards are not valid in your theatre (that is very strange - even your advertisement has  information about discounts). Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was delayed for 45 minutes! So we were late for our supper in the hotel and the theatre restaurant was also closed without any reasons given.
And I think that I made the right choice of  profession - it is the perfect combination: a very progressive form of  modern technology, and the most important thing - it is extremely interesting to me!
Regarding the accommodation at the camp, I would prefer the tents, because it is something different which you don't do every day!
I recently had a week's holiday in London, and, during my stay, I went to your theatre to see "Over the Rainbow" because I had seen an advertisement for this show and I was really interested in seeing it for many reasons, one of the reasons  is that I love the star, Danny Brook. And I would like  you to know that I have had a very disappointing evening, due to the differences between the advertisement and the show that I saw.
my name is John and I went to the latest International Arts Festival. The purpose of this letter is just to let you know my opinion of the event.
First, I would like to congratulate you on the success you have been having year after year. Nevertheless, I have some suggestions that may be useful for next year's festival.
Moreover, and I know that that point is not easy, although we are still students, the most suitable job for us would be a position related to our degree. Next year I expect  to finish my studies in LAW. And by that time I will already have some experience, so that I will be able to apply more easily for a really good job.
So, why don't we think more about the future, instead of being upset about how to get some money to pay for the next party?
In the advertisement, it states that the actor in this show is Danny Brook and TINA TRUELOVE. As a result I asked my acquaintance to come with me to the show. As soon as the show started, I realised that the actor wasn't DANNY.
The story began in 1989 in New York. Mallory and his partner, Pat, had thought up the best plan in the world, which was to steal the diamond from the national bank. However, the only way to get into the building was at the top of the building. Their plan was to cut the alarm from the top of the building. The alarm was situated at the top. So they could take their time, rather than going in through the front door. As soon as Mallory stole the diamond, he ran away. Unfortunately the guard saw him. By the time he got out of the building, the cops were everywhere but as long as Mallory is alive, he won't be arrested, with his unpredictable mind. He ran into the old building, and hid a diamond in there. Unfortunately, the building was a police station.
For the attention of the Circle Theatre Manager:
We were both in the same class in high school and used to spend a lot of time together; we were actually very good friends and had no secrets from each other.
I'm writing to you in the name of all the students who will go on the London trip.
We hope you consider our request which would be much appreciated by the class.
I know that everyone is excited about what happened at Michael Douglas' wedding or what kind of life the President of the United States is living but sometimes it's going a bit too far.
It was written in the advertisement that Danny BROOK was going to star with Tina TRUELOVE, but it was not him who starred. That disappointed  me and the people who just went to see him.
And regarding the time, the show was meant to start at 19:30, however it started at 20:15. Therefore, people there had to wait for 45 minutes. Also, it was said there would be discounts on the tickets but I had nothing like this. All the people there paid the same amount of money. After the show, I went to the restaurant in the theatre to eat something but it was closed because it was being cleaned that day.
It all started two years ago. Rod was a happy man at that time. One day, while he was gardening, he saw an old lady being kidnapped by some strange men, who he ran after and one of whom he caught. Just then, the strange man took out his gun. Rod jumped on him and the man killed himself with his own gun. Nobody saw and nobody heard what had happened.
To be honest I had doubts about winning the competition, because in spite of  thinking I did well, I had to play against  very strong competition. The idea of going to California for 2 weeks makes me feel very excited.
Referring to your letter, July is the  time that suits me best. My job is less demanding in July.
But not everything about shopping is enjoyable. For example, I hate it when I get into a shopping centre and it is crowded. I don't like it when I have to try on different sizes because the small size doesn't fit me because I have put on weight. It is at this moment when really I realise I am getting fat and it is a horrible feeling.
Thanks for accepting me in the competition. I hear that the competition there is very intense, and that Camp California is very famous for its competitions. I would like to travel in July because before then it's impossible for me and it's my birthday in July and I wish to spend my birthday at the camp, also 'cause in August the planes are full. Another thing is my accommodation. I prefer to have log cabins because it's easiest for me. I will choose for my activities tennis and swimming. I'm good at tennis because I have played since 1990 and I love it and I chose swimming because I like to swim and I've been in two competitions and I won both.
For me going shopping is not the best thing I can do. Well I thought the opposite about a year ago but recently I have thought this because I see all the people going shopping and they don't realise that  outside in the real world there are poor people who need that money which they are only spending on material things. You might put your money in the bank because you don't need it now, but tomorrow you don't know. I like to shop sometimes but not always and I don't like spending a lot of money on things that I don't really need. As to the rest of you who don't understand this, it's on your mind to keep shopping and spending all your money on things that you don't really need.
Bye and think about this.
Most people believe that shopping is the most entertaining . Some people will go shopping when they are sad to forget everything and the fact is that everybody knows how to shop. If you have children, you will know  very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying . However, they are happy once they have it. Anyway,  in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new , suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.  I like shopping too and I believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money  to survive.
The reason I'm writing this letter to you is that during my stay in London I felt very disappointed about your theatre.
When I went to that theatre I was very excited because I was thinking I would see my favourite musical star, someone who actually didn't appear; I noticed that in the show, there was someone completely different to him so I felt bad.
When I bought my tickets, I noticed I didn't get any discount like the one that was written on the folder. After the show I wanted something from the theatre's restaurant, but it was closed.
Technology nowadays is something everybody has on his  mind. Every person in the world looks to technology every day to improve the way they live their own lives.
Nowadays, it's very common to have a computer in your house, and when you have to do some homework, you can type it on your computer, print it and bring it to  school. Also you can search for new subjects on the Internet.
Finally, technology is a word that we will never get out of our minds, and we don't know how , or at what speed, it will develop in the future. Maybe, technology will never stop advancing and our life will never work without computers.
You need more explanations from me to understand my motivation at the end of this story. In fact, I did this kind of study because of my interests in programming. The problem is that I can't keep calm during an exam .
Firstly, we got our tickets at your ticket office just one hour before the show. We thought, as usually we do in London theatres, we could get discounts, and it's written on your advertisement . Surprisingly, there were no discounts.
Thirdly, we were astonished by the actors, whom we know from other musicals. Why did you not change the names on your advertisement?
I hope we are not the only people to be so upset, but it was the first and the last time that I come to your theatre.
As usual, Jon, Scala's husband came & bought the bread for the evening. Pat's mum was so excited about the baby, she just said "Congratulations about the new baby."
 I would suggest going to the show instead of the National Art Gallery because we could go there another time. Or going to the show on Wednesday morning and in the afternoon, we can choose between free time or the National Art Gallery.
They found him two months later and six months later he was in jail. To forget everything, I moved to Irkind with my sister to a small house in the countryside. Everything was going , when one day, I went into the house and found my mother sitting in a chair reading a book, with blood all around her.
I am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
The aim of this report is to suggest which activities in our daily life at school should be filmed to give the other students an idea of what we usually do, not only during the lessons but also the rest of the time.
Most of the students agree in saying that there are two  main features in our daily life at school which should be filmed: it would be very funny to concentrate on us working and speaking together, without the help of the teacher,  and also to film some amusing moments we spend waiting for the teacher.
First of all, there were no discounts available such as  were promised in the advertisement so I had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
Then, I was forced to wait forty-five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and, when it finally started, I was really disappointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
As far as the activities are concerned, I have chosen sailing and surfing. The reason for my decision is that other activities are also available in my country, except climbing, but I have a fear of heights so this one is not destined for people like me.
I am writing in order to complain about what you have written in the advertisement in the newspaper.
On the other hand what will happen to us in the future? Our lives will be managed by robots and they will replace us at work.
Over the centuries man's clothes have been changing and even developing in some ways. People wore clothes made from metal, which were rather heavy, I suppose. They wore enormous luxurious dresses, which, in my opinion, you can't feel very comfortable in. Nowadays people wear more ordinary clothes. I think we can draw a conclusion: over the centuries man's clothes have been becoming less heavy and luxurious and more ordinary.
I am very happy to have won the first prize in the competition, and I am going to clarify some details you asked me about in your letter.
, during my stay at Camp California, I want to go swimming because I practise this activity regularly and I often enter competitions: this is one of my hobbies. In addition to this, I wish  to go sailing: I have never tried it, but it looks great!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR LETTER YOU SENT ME LAST WEEK. I'M VERY PROUD TO BE THE WINNER OF YOUR COMPETITION! I HAVE NEVER BEEN TO SUCH A CAMP BEFORE AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SPENDING TWO WEEKS THERE. HERE IS THE INFORMATION YOU ASKED FOR:
IT IS ONLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO TRAVEL IN JULY BECAUSE OF MY IRREGULAR WORK. JULY IS THE LOW SEASON AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO GO ON HOLIDAY THEN. FURTHER I WOULD PREFER A TENT. I WAS AT A SPORTS CAMP LAST YEAR AND IT WAS FUN TO SLEEP IN TENTS.
WHEN I ARRIVED WE FIRST HAD A MEETING. ALL OF THE STAFF  AND THE ORGANISATION SPOKE ABOUT THE RULES AND HOW TO SAVE PEOPLE. AFTER THE MEETING WE ALL RECEIVED THE SAME CLOTHES. WE WERE A GROUP! ONE TEAM! BEFORE THE CONCERT WE HAD A BREAK TO EAT SOMETHING AND TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT HOBBIES AND JOBS.
Firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
Secondly, there was a delay with the show, which was supposed to start at 19.30 but it  actually started at 20:15. This really upset me as no notice was given before the show.
Finally, I would like to ask for my money back on the ticket due to the disappointing evening out and the misleading advertisement you have .
I would like to inform you that we have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we have found it very interesting. There will be a lot of  latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. I would like to say that it is very important for us to be there and it could be a great opportunity, because  entrance is free for students. The event is planned for the 14th of March between 10.00 and 19.00. If it is possible we would like to ask you to change your programme. We would be able to visit the Science Museum on Wednesday afternoon. We have checked that it is open every day. As you know we are the best students in our school and it would be a nice reward for our work during this year.
My dog was very angry. I was afraid that someone was near my house and wanted to get into my house.
Suddenly someone broke my window. I had no time to think. I grabbed one of the pots and hit him on his head. One moment later I called the police.
I am just coming back from a week's holiday in London, which has been all in all really nice. The only thing which really disappointed me was a visit to your theatre where I wanted to see the musical 'over the rainbow', after I read the advertisement for the show.
Since everyone can afford modern technology everyone's life in the more developed countries has changed completely. We can't imagine living without it anymore because we are so dependent on it.
Notwithstanding the fact that I could have expected a discount on my ticket, it happened to be impossible to get one.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Of course, it was my fault. I should have known better but I had to tell   someone. It was far too hard to keep it to myself. So I made a mistake and I told her.
I am a great fan of Danny Brook and went to see him in his new show, but, to my surprise, it wasn't him who played that night but another, horrible young actor. I went with my daughter, a university student, and she was supposed to get a discount on the ticket. We asked for it and we were told that there was no discount either for her  or anyone else, so I had to pay the full price of the two tickets.
Very soon, Lise understood that it was useless to continue pretending that she knew nothing about it, and decided to make a deal with her class mates. She would give them the exam's questions and they would do all her homework for 3 weeks.
I'm writing this letter to congratulate you on the excellent international arts festival we  enjoyed last November. I think it was a very good idea. However, there are a few things that I personally think could be improved in  future years.
Nearly at the end of this letter I have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave  the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
Another suggestion is that you go to your cinema and ask if they need your help with changing the film rolls,  cleaning the toilets or doing some other small jobs.
Firstly, I would like to travel there in July because it is the only month that I have free from my job. It will be impossible at another time, but if you have any problem you will be able to advise me, although I prefer to go there in July because I think it is the best month to travel; the weather is nicer and warmer than in other seasons.
In my opinion shopping is not a thing that I would like to do in my free time. I think that it's too stressful, there are too many people in the shops, so I prefer to spend my free time  swimming or painting and I go shopping on the days when usually there are not too many people.
Regarding accommodation at this camp, I would prefer staying in a tent to staying in a log cabin. It is more fun and more sociable. It will allow me to make friends more quickly.
I'm so happy about the experience I had last month.
First I was chosen to sell the tickets. I was really happy to help at a concert as big as Mylene Farmer's.
But, the principal reason for this letter is to ask for some money back. I think that would be  best for everyone, and I'd like to give you some advice; if somebody pays you for a ticket, try to give the best you can.
Many years ago, more or less seventy years ago a young man, with an excellent capacity for thinking and inventing  things, started building a big thing called a "time machine". He worked day and night.
The other day, I worked at a pop concert to help. It was really more interesting than I expected. My job  behind the stage was helping with make-up, hair and clothes . It was very hard. The singers often changed their clothes and their make-up was  because of the sweat. It was different from when I did it at college. There was no time to rest. But I met a lot of famous singers and spoke to them. So many people were in front of the stage and they couldn't see them very well, but I was  very near to the stage and I could see them just there.
Anyway, shall we meet sometime? We haven't seen each other for so long time and I'll tell you more stories about this.
I'm writing this letter to complain about the show which I saw at your theatre.
For example, we don't have to wash our face with cold water even if it is a freezing morning. We can live in a clean and comfortably air-conditioned house. The housework doesn't take much time thanks to electrical equipment. And we can speak to anyone at anytime on a phone even if he or she is abroad. Further, we can get a lot of information  with the Internet. In addition, we can travel  anywhere in the world in a few days.
The biggest disadvantage is pollution. These days, many kinds of pollution have been caused by our modern lifestyle. Air pollution from cars, Soil pollution from industrial waste. The sea is also polluted by oil and the chemical detergents which are used in the home. Even food is polluted. All these facts mean that our modern life causes great damage to the earth. All of us must notice this fact. And we should  in order to save our precious earth.
Your advert promised me a "Perfect evening out", but it was a terrible evening for me. So I want you to give me a refund.
I write this letter to inform you about the bad experience I had last week at one of the shows your are putting on.
First of all, on the sheet I received, it says that DANNY BROOK was one of the actors. That is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and I don't know what his name is.
I am writing this letter to let you know my decision in reply to your letter, which I have received recently. I would like to thank you for the competition which was organised by your agency and I must say that I was very surprised when I received the result of the competition.
I think I could have a holiday only in July because I will have been working for my  company for one year by the end of the June and I will have a one-month holiday  from my company. I would  prefer to stay in a tent than stay in the log cabin because a tent is more enjoyable.
I might say that I am really good at swimming and sailing because I have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and I have had a really good training in water sports.
As you know, I'd never been to any activities as  a volunteer before. The concert tickets were very expensive and I'd seen an advertisement on  TV. It said, "Be a volunteer at our concert and get a free ticket." After that I applied and they accepted my application.
All our class love Mr Brown very much, so we decided to organise a surprise party for him. The party is on Tuesday 16 of June. You should come to the college canteen at 3 pm. We have bought some snacks to eat and three students will sing for him, too.
Besides this, we have invited all the other teachers and the Principal of our school. Of course all the class will take part in this party. However, we don't know what present to buy for him. So we would appreciate it if you could help us with this matter. We have thought about buying a CD or a book. He loves to read books. What do you think? If he needs something else, we are happy to buy this.
Apart from this, parents could be very helpful to their children regarding difficulties at school. They help their children with lessons and give them some useful advice with their relationships. Because sometimes they are upset when they lose a friend.
The way in which the family comes in contact with the members so easily is love. So we should trust only our family when we need help or solutions to our problems.
You are asking me to choose just 2 activities. It's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them I like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if I have to make a choice, I choose climbing and surfing. I'm rather experienced at climbing. I have done it once a month since I was 17. But on the other hand, I have never been surfing. I am a complete beginner but I am dying to do it.
After that, we should have a morning shot of one of the busiest London tube stations in order to show stressed people going in and out, among them our protagonist leaving peacefully with a couple of books in his hand - then the school's door, and him going in.
It was found that hockey is the most popular sport among students. As the record says, our hockey team has been at the top of the league for three successive years. The girls' football team is also famous for its reputation of keenness on practice. Although every school has a boys' football team, our school is the only one which possesses a girls' team. Team members can be interviewed.
I hope to have news from you as soon as possible
Furthermore, your theatre restaurant was closed because the employees were on  strike. On top of everything, the main actor, Danny Brook, did not appear in the show. The actor who appeared instead of him was terrible.
In conclusion, in 100 years clothes will not be as fashionable as they are now. We should consider .
I have just returned from my holiday in London. During my stay I went to see a musical show at the Circle Theatre and I had a very disappointing evening.
One day he invited us to his party. I was very happy and nervous. Everything was great. But when Pat drank some beer she told him everything about me. Everybody started to laugh at me. I was angry and I ran away to the forest.
I'm sorry to tell you that I'm really disappointed with your advertisement for the musical show at the Circle Theatre. First of all, I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite actors Danny Brook in the show, but you had a different actor, which disappointed me very much. Also, the show didn't start on time, it started half an hour late. And you had written in your advert that there would be discounts available, which weren't available that evening. After the show we wanted to visit the restaurant, but it was closed because of the  inside the restaurant. Finally we did not have a perfect evening at all! And because of these circumstances, I would like to have a part of my money back.
I am looking forward to your reply!
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I knew that he's a very talkative person, but it was necessary because I wanted him to be the main organiser of that birthday party for . It started a week before that day. Pat found a great place for the party called "Blue Box". I made  beautiful invitations  for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "Do not tell Agatha about this. This is a surprise party for her. Please keep the secret!" Pat arranged a great DJ and drinks. My friend and I made the perfect decorations with balloons and other party stuff. Everyone told us it was breathtaking. Everything was set... the day and hour came. Everyone gathered in the disco at 21.00. We were only waiting for Agatha, who was expected at 22 o'clock with her boyfriend. It was so exciting!!! We turned off the lights and then the door opened and I just heard "What the hell is going on?!!" She entered the room, and everyone shouted HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR! She was so touched that we started to cry. Anyway the disco was great, . We had fun until 5 o'clock! Agatha said that it was the greatest present she could ever receive!
At the moment, I'm worried  about not being able to enjoy it because I have recently got a new job and I started working just three months ago. For this reason I am afraid I won't be allowed to choose the time of my holidays.
Consequently I hope that it is possible to join the camp during the last two weeks of July, when the company I work for suspends its activities. As far as I am concerned, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, but in case there are no cabins left I can stay in a tent as well.
In general, shopping is considered a pleasant activity. Actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion. In fact, the shopping you do for your daily needs is seldom enjoyable, as it is clearly more a duty than a pleasure and moreover you are often faced with some nasty situations. Shops and markets are often noisy and crowded, you don't know where to park your car, shop assistants are rude and sometimes they don't know how to do their job. Anyway if you can choose the time and the place, and if you go shopping just because you like it, and not because you need to, shopping can be a very nice activity.
I attended your festival and I would like to give you my suggestions for it. I must say that the International Arts Festival is really a great idea. And your last festival was very interesting too.
I think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want. I hope you will continue  holding your festivals.
I thought that I would have a great time there, but I was really disappointed with that evening. You said there would be stars such as Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, whose music is my favourite, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names I had never heard of. In the advertisement for the show, you said it would begin at 19.30. Actually it was delayed 45 minutes. The discounts on tickets that you mentioned did not exist. It made things worse that our visit to your theatre restaurant, which had already been closed because of a lack of customers, was cancelled. Really, what a letdown!
I am really looking forward to taking part in Camp California.
First of all, in your letter you asked me my preferred travel dates. If it is possible, I would only like to travel in July because I am going to be on  holiday in July.
In your letter,  at Camp California. I would like to be in tents because I  find  being in tents more comfortable than being in log cabins.
In your letter, you want to hear about my experience at a pop concert. I'll tell you about my experience helping at the pop concert.
However, there was something good for me. I saw a lot of singers and entertainers. I didn't need to pay an entrance fee because I was working there.
I'll tell you more about the experience in my next letter.
I have to arrive in time for dinner, because it is the only time at which my family can eat together. For me, it's very stressful and I usually run a lot to do it. In fact (you know) I like  with my classmates after our lessons.
I am very happy that I won this competition. I would like to travel as soon as possible because now I am on holiday. My holidays will finish at the beginning of September and it will be good to travel during this period. (August-September).
For the time that I will spend there I would like to choose more than two activities but I know it is not possible so I choose swimming and singing. I usually sing in my spare time and my friends love it when I sing and regarding swimming I was champion last year in my city. So, I am quite good.
This report is going to give us ideas about which lessons and other activities should be filmed from our daily life at school.
- asking for money from your parents (mum is better) is the most traditional way but also the safest one
Firstly, I would like to start my trip in the second week of July because I will have a 3-week holiday in July. I could not travel in June and May because I will have my standard grade exam during these two months.
I was chosen to help at a pop concert by chance  last month. At that time, I was so nervous because I did not know what to do. However, I was excited to meet lots of people and the pop star, Kelly Chen. When I first entered the concert hall, I was given a pass for working here. There were five other students, like me, who were waiting to help. We were sitting at the back of the concert hall and chatting with each other. I found that they were all Kelly's fans. We were told that we were responsible for decorating the hall. There were lots of decorations and I had to put the decorations in the right place. It was  tiring work because I had to run from place to place  to hang the decorations. After I had finished my work, I saw Kelly Chen walking into the concert hall. She smiled at me and said thank you to me. I was very happy at that time and I thought it was the happiest moment that I ever had. At last, the concert started. There were many people at the show and I was sitting in a good seat to watch the concert.
I had a really good time with this experience because I could meet my favourite singer. Could you tell me what your happiest moment is?
I would like to travel in July to California. The reason is that we have long holidays at school at that time. Although the accommodation isn't so important for me, I would prefer the log cabin because of the comfort and the better bed.
I have chosen as my activities surfing and photography. I'm a beginner at both activities.
The sales assistants in the stores aren't so nice or helpful. Sometimes they give me a bad feeling like .
Last week I was shopping with my younger brother. Awful! He wanted everything that his eyes saw. All the stuff for children is on the same level as  their eyes. Afterwards, I felt tired and unsatisfied with the store.
First, all the students and I would like to thank you for this great idea of a trip to London for three days. The programme is very exciting and interesting, especially the river trip to Greenwich.
So, one day I decided to rob the bank. For weeks, I had prepared my plan, trying not to forget anything important. Everything was ready and I was too. So I knew that the day after would be the right one.
I got up very early. All the city was sleeping. The weather was cold. When I arrived in front of the bank, my heart was going faster. A few days before, I had found a little window at the back of the building, so I entered in this way and by chance I just arrived in the vault. I hadn't ever seen so much money. I took it,  and went out  the same way. I ran to my house and went back to my bed  to sleep a little bit.
My personal best is 27.66 for fifty meters. I would like to ask you about the weather in California in July. What kind of clothes should I bring with me? Are there any discotheques or something? I would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her I can't be there.
However, all my expectations failed to come true. First of all, I found that no discounts on tickets were available although you mentioned them in your advertisement. Next, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30. And, finally, right before the start they announced that Danny Brook would not be in the show that evening. So he was replaced by another actor. After the show I was not surprised at all to learn that the theatre restaurant was closed for redecoration.
Among the greatest inventions of man I come across daily are the telephone, computer and automobile. At any time of the day I may contact any person in any part of the world over the phone. It takes me less than a minute to get in touch with my friend Nigel living in Australia - thousands of kilometres away from me. The computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get  access to  informational sources through the Internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly. The automobile saves me time when I'm travelling.
We were planning to go to the theatre restaurant after the show but when we got there we saw that it was closed for  cleaning.
Nowadays the aim of clothing is not just for covering and protecting ourselves. People try to look nice and clean by wearing good clothes.
The things we wear may not seem like  'clothes' to the ones who will live 100 years from now. I believe they will wear very different things.
The only time available for me to travel is July. Any time during the month suits me. I need to insist on it, because I am not able to take holidays during the rest of the year.
Finally I'm writing to let you know about the most exciting experience in my life. Can you believe that I was helping at the last Britney Spears Concert?
She was so kind to all of us. Of course I asked her for an autograph. I hope to see you soon. I can't wait to show it to you.
I received your letter last week and I would like to thank you very much. I was really surprised and happy to hear that I had won the first prize.  In your letter you ask me some questions about my preferences:
The purpose of this report is to identify which lessons or other activities should be filmed. In order to prepare this report I visited the classrooms on many occasions and talked to the students and teachers.
To sum up, I would suggest filming our library, because it is a pleasant place that students really like, and the English lesson, which will help foreign students in their future decisions.
It is a very long time since I was in Year 7. I told Pat that my father and mother were going to separate. I told her because I wanted somebody to share my feelings. Maybe it was the wrong decision to tell her. She began to share that secret with everybody, including the teachers. They tried to contact  my parents. My parents were very angry when they realised what had happened. All my friends were trying to keep their distance from me. That was all because of Pat.
I have just received your letter where you stated that I won the first prize in the competition, about which I need more information.
To begin with, in your letter you asked me when I would like to travel. Well, I would only be available in July, because at that time I would be on my winter holidays. Also, I prefer sleeping in a tent to sleeping in a log cabin because it is easier to clean.
Regarding accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin because I think it is safer than  a tent.
On that occasion I hadn't the opportunity  to give my opinion on this task.
Manager, I expect that you have considered my bad experience at your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because it was a very bad evening.
Classmate Secret Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets for his classmate. The class had organized a secret party for our friend Nick who was leaving the school in 2 more weeks. It all started when Pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. Most of the class disagreed with that because the Pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him that his house was like a box. Pat got very angry and sad. Pat, affected by this situation, told Nick all about the situation and the class secret. At first Nick got angry but then he forgave him because they were friends and each of them could trust in the other. Nick told the situation to the class and offered his house for the party, because it was very big, with large gardens and a big swimming pool. The day of the party everyone had fun, especially Pat who to start with was sad.
Firstly, I can only travel in July because that's when I have vacations from school. Secondly, I prefer to stay in a tent. I have stayed in a tent a few times and I have not had any problems. About the activities that I can do at the camp, I chose to play Basketball, which is my favourite sport, because I want to do some exercise while I am on vacation. I also chose photography because it is one of my hobbies. I am very good at both activities because I have done them all my life.
It was a great idea  to do something like that. There were jazz, rock and classical concerts, but some concert halls were too small for all the people who attended that festival. There were also plays and films, dance shows, which I liked the most, art exhibitions and talks by writers, but it would be good to see more plays and films next year. Also it was a great idea to have one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events.
I've just received this letter from you, so I'm writing to you. I hope that you feel good, because I haven't seen you for two years.
As you know, I'm not a secondary school student, I'm now a student of architecture in Krakow. I have lessons from Monday till Friday. On Saturday and Sunday we don't have lessons, but it doesn't seem that we don't have work. We are allowed to prepare for the next week's lessons. At my school there is a lot of drawing and painting, and some other subjects done by hand. We also learn how to design  interiors and buildings. It's very interesting. We usually have lessons in the morning, till the afternoon. We don't have tests during the whole student year, only at the end of the class. There are also some exams. After a few months we go somewhere with all the class, for example near a lake, and there we paint  nature.
I recently spent a week in London and during my stay I went to the theatre in order to see "Over the Rainbow" - the musical  . At first, I thought I would have a wonderful night out since I had read the advertisement for the show, however, it was misleading.
First of all, the advertisement for the show said that Danny Brook was going to be on stage. However, he did not appear during the show; that disappointed me a lot.
When we were at  primary school, my teacher wanted to surprise Tom (a school mate) on his 10th birthday by arranging a fancy dress party at the school.
When I found the advertisement for the International Arts Festival, I was very excited. It is  to hold an annual international arts festival in this place. Then I spent two days at the festival. I enjoyed it very much. There were so many exciting things I saw, such as stars and artists from around the world, jazz, rock and classical concerts, plays and dance shows etc. The  thing that is worth remembering here is the reasonably-priced ticket for all events, it is excellent because most tourists could  what they liked.
You mentioned the rules at home and at school in the letter. This reminds me of what I experienced during my teenage years. In my country the children go to  secondary school when they are in the first year of being a teenager. You know, this age is the troublesome age, boys have too much energy and girls want to fall in love with someone. They always annoy the schoolteacher and their parents. As a result of this, the teachers make very strict rules at school, such as students aren't allowed to speak to each other in  class. They have to finish homework within a limited time. They cannot   the teacher, girls are not allowed to wear make-up or wear any jewellery. At home, in my experience, my parents didn't allow me to go out in the evening and gave me a lot of  homework to do, even in the holiday. They also forbade me to have a boyfriend. I think it is not just what happened in my home, many of my friends had the same experience.
Now I'm a mother of two children. They are both in  school. Compared to my experience, I want to give them a more open attitude about everything. I want to be a mother to them and a friend to them. But at school, although I hope the teacher doesn't give students so much homework, and doesn't forbid the  of the students, there is nothing I can do because of our culture. It's quite sad.
Dear Mr Robertson, one of the reasons that we are writing this letter to you is because we would like to thank you for this short trip to London. We believe that the programme is very good and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time  for that.
The class is very excited about that because the Show covers the latest Fashions, leisure and Sports Wear, make-up and hairstyles. We believe that this is a great opportunity because it is one of the best shows of the year. Also the majority of the class has never had the chance to visit a show like this and the most important and best part is that  admission is Free for Students. And that we thought  very good as otherwise we could not afford it.
We hope we do not cause any problems with your programme and hope that you will accept our request. From all your class
Of course if you are in the public eye, the reasons why you want privacy are different, because if you are a politician, for  example, you fear for your life. You need to protect your life from any danger. Because 
I would like to go in July because it's the only month I can choose. In July I'll be on my vacation. As for accommodation I would prefer to stay in tents. In my opinion it's the best way of joining nature and fully enjoying it. I'd be glad to choose painting and singing. And I'm good at both because I used to go to a painting studio when I was at school. I also used to be in the school choir and was one of the best sopranos. So I'd be happy to do the activities for two reasons. First I am good enough at both of them. Secondly I truly love painting and singing.
I would like to know what the weather is like in California in July to know what clothes I should take. Another thing I am interested in is general information on prices in the USA.
I will be able to travel only in July because it is my summer holiday and I assumed that it will be  enough time to fit the trip in. Also I cannot go during other holidays because for the Easter holiday I need to take part in a Tennis competition  my school and we need time to practise. In the Christmas holiday I would like to go back home and be with my family. Also we are going on a  with my relatives. Those are the reasons why I cannot go on your trip at any other time. I do apologize about that.
I would like to choose these 2 activities, they are Tennis and Climbing. As I said before,  I have to take part in a tennis competition, so I think I am quite good at it. I started playing tennis when I was 9. Now I am 18 years old. I was in the tennis county  when I was 12. I have taken part in 15 competitions already. I have lost 5 games and won 10 games. My dad encourages me to play tennis and I enjoy it. Regarding climbing, I started to be interested in it when I was 14. My family live near the sea so we get quite a lot of chances to go climbing. I'm not scared of heights and I think it's challenging. My sister loves nature and climbing so she is the one who influences me.
As you know I took art for my GCSE and fortunately I liked it and got quite good marks for my project about light and sound. So my art teacher came to me and my best friend, who is really good at art too, and asked whether we would be able and willing to help with the concert in two weeks' time in the concert hall. I immediately said "yes" and so did my friend. I really thought it sounded so interesting. I had never done light and sound for a real pop concert before and I thought it would be a good experience for me. Actually I'd just done light and sound for a drama day at my school at the end of last term. But this time it'd be different, I thought. Do you know that this concert will be on television?
, my ambition is to be like one of those professionals. I really do hope I can be like them. My teacher was very proud of me because after the concert, all the staff were saying how helpful I was and so on. Do you know, my ambition makes me try to work very hard and this term I got A for my art and design. It encouraged me so much and I think I can be good at it if I keep on working hard. I think the concert has changed me so much. Now I have my aim for what I should do in my life. I feel like I have to work harder.
Everyone in the class wishes to go to the London fashion and leisure show which will be held on Tuesday 14th March from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. At the show, we will be able to see the latest fashions - leisure- and sports-wear, make-up and hairstyles. It is essential because many people in the class are thinking of studying fashion in future. Entrance  is free for students so the show is well worth seeing.
The pop singer was called Hikaru Utada, she is only seventeen years old but she is the most popular singer now in Japan. The concert started at 7.00 p.m. At that time I was on the second floor where I had to work .  I stood up in front of the audience and . I couldn't see 'Hikaru' but I still could hear her songs. I thought if you were here I could really enjoy it with you.
I must say though, I would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.
Well, you want to know what I did at the concert? Help..
To sum up, there are many other discoveries related to  modern technology which affect my daily life. However, it would take too long to list them all, and I am quite sure that you are also familiar with them as they don't change only my life, but everybody's daily life.
First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year it is very hot and I prefer going in summer to going in winter or during it other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter it would be impossible to do.
Thirdly, I would prefer to swim and play tennis, because I have been doing this since I was I child, and I think I am very good at each activity.
Finally, I would like to ask you if I have to take some money, or if everything is provided by the organisers. Furthermore, I would be grateful if you could tell me what type of clothes I have to take.
What I really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and  make-up , because I learnt how to do make-up for someone and I spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
Concerning the table of  activities, I choose singing and swimming because I am a very good swimmer and have been a very keen singer from a very young age. I joined my choir when I was eight years old and I have sung solo in two concerts.
I am really impressed with your interest in my experience at the concert. I thought that you didn't like pop music and .
Regarding the accommodation, if  possible I would like to stay in a tent because I think it is a relaxing place  to stay. Furthermore because I like to live in contact with  nature. Also it is possible to meet a lot of people, and to chat during the night, perhaps around the fire, playing a  and singing. I think it is a nice way to have fun.
To begin with the school rules, we have in fact some important ones. Firstly, when you arrive late for your lesson, you have to apologize  to your teacher. Also, when you have forgotten to do your homework. What's more, you had better do it or you will have to go to the blackboard!
I would like to complain about four things concerning your theatre. First thing, the actor is really horrible so I recommend you change the actor because he will disappoint an audience who visits your theatre.
Regarding the advertisement, it said  but when I bought the ticket, the discounts were not available
Another example is the computer. I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can get the news by using the Internet on the computer.
To sum up,  modern technology has changed my daily life in bad ways and good ways. Therefore my daily life will change in bad ways or goods ways. It depends on how I use the technology.
The show is on 14th March on Tuesday. That is  the second day of our trip and it starts at 10.00 in the morning and lasts until 19.00. My friends told me that if we wake up early on Tuesday we can go to the Science Museum at about 8.00 in the morning. Your afternoon plan is to go shopping but we can do our shopping on Wednesday afternoon because we will have  some free time on Wednesday.
I'd like to tell you something about the show. It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and it is free for students. It is a great opportunity for us because when we go there we will learn about the latest fashions news, we will see leisure and sports wear, allthe new make-up designers () and different hairstyles.
Now IT (information technology) is  our life. We can get everything we want to know from computers. It means we don't need to go anywhere to get the information we need. We'll be stuck to our computers at home. Whatever we need we order via  the computer and someone will bring it. It means we'll lose our social life.
Regarding accommodation, I would rather stay in a tent. I want to enjoy the wildlife and admire the landscape.
You wouldn't believe it! I was working helping to build and dismantle the stage. Sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something into the microphone. That was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sang in a duet with the vocalist of the group. It was such  great fun!
Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got the prize of a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA.
Because of my business, I am very busy and this  is the best time for my business so I can't organise any time to go on holiday, but I'd be able to travel at anytime in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent as I feel that it would be more exciting than staying in a log cabin. As you offered me two activities, I would like to go  swimming. I am not a good swimmer yet but soon I will be. I have been learning to swim for the last eight months and I have been really enjoying it. Another sport I have played is Basketball, which I used to play for the school's team when I was at secondary school. I have not been playing it at all recently but only wish I had. This trip will certainly be a good opportunity for me to start playing it again.
I need some more information about the programme. Because  my class want to go to the London Fashion and Leisure show during your programme and we need some timetables and  to go there. You didn't tell us any details about how much the ticket costs  to go inside.
Firstly, I wanted to see DANN BLOCK performing as your advertisement already said, but there was a different actor instead of him on that evening. In addition to this, the show did not start on time, 19:30, so I had to wait for 45 minutes. Another disappointing thing was that you did not explain the reason why it was delayed until 20:15.
In recent years, as Information Technology has been improved greatly, communication methods have been changed to a different way, which is not the same as before.
I can find out some information at home, although I do not go to the library. I am able to meet my friends quickly on the Internet by just clicking the mouse. In addition to these things, I can contact  anyone who I want to talk to at any convenient time in case I need him or her, or I am needed.
It is causing some changes in me. So, now I would rather send an e-mail than a letter, and I prefer to surf the Internet when I need to find something. As it has given me different kinds of communication systems, my daily life is more comfortable, relaxed and faster.
13.Jun. 2000 Dear Sir or Madam, I am very pleased to hear that I won the first prize in the competition. It would be great for me to go to the U.S.A as the prize and to stay for two weeks. Below is the information you requested from me. Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have got a prior plan to teach  Korean children in Brighton about Korea and Korean history in  early August. Secondly, I would like to stay in log cabins which would have a good smell of nature in them. Also if I have to choose two of the activities, I would like to play tennis and to go surfing because playing tennis is my first choice and I am very good at it. And also the reason why I would like to go surfing is that I am always dreaming of surfing on the coast of California like on TV, but I have never tried to surf yet, which doesn't mean I am bad at swimming. Finally, I would like you to let me know which clothes would be suitable for the weather at that time and how much money I should take. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Yours faithfully, Haneul Gay Kay.
Firstly, you cannot always get the right thing although you scour  all the shops to find something you want. You may only get tired   feet. And also you would have to thread your way between the shoppers because there are too many shoppers, especially on  special occasions like during a sale. Secondly, you cannot  that you might get robbed by a pick-pocket which would make you upset and irritated when you think of how you could avoid it and that you could take less money in your wallet .
To sum up, you should spend money according to your plan and you should be cautious and sensible to make it enjoyable.
Shopping is a part of my everyday life. I'm a mother of four  and you can easily imagine how many things I have to buy in a week. It starts with food (monstrous) and goes on to clothes, pills, games and so on. It never ends! But contrary to what you might expect, I love shopping. I find it  very relaxing . At home, you have to work hard and you're often stressed because  your children are always asking you for something. When you're shopping, you can finally relax, just admiring what you see. Your only task consists in choosing what suits you or buying what you prefer for dinner, for instance; furthermore you're not disturbed: it's a dream!
To be fair, I must say that I've noticed one drawback to shopping: you need money!
Our English class has an additional wish concerning the programme for our trip. We have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go to the show. We think it is a great opportunity because it only takes place once a year and it is free for students. We would suggest replacing the shopping trip on Tuesday afternoon with the visit to the show. We think we would all have another chance for shopping in London sometime later.
Please think about our suggestion and the proposed change to the programme. We are sure this is suitable for all of us. Thank you very much.
You want  some further information from me. About the date when I want to travel, can I say that it is only possible for me in July because I have to do some exams at  school. Regarding the accommodation at the camp, I would prefer a tent.  The reason is that I like to live really naturally and it is more enjoyable to live in a tent than in a cabin.
Regarding activities, I can say that I like every sport, but basketball and tennis would be perfect for me. In basketball I have had more practice than in tennis. I play every weekend in competitions with my local team and .
How are you my lovely penfriend? Well, I hope. You want to know how it was to work and help at a pop concert? It was marvellous. You see the stars so near and also you can chat with them. On my first day I had to help to bring the stuff for the band, things like guitars, drums and other things. It was  hard work for a while but I was so happy  to help at a really big pop concert I can't describe it. On the other two days I helped to prepare the breakfast, lunch and dinner for the band. You are always so near to these people and after a while it is normal to stay and chat with Brian Adams, for example. I really enjoyed that and it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest experience of my life. On the other hand it was a well-paid job at 15 pounds per hour.  What  can you say!
Thank you very much for the prize. I went crazy when I knew I was the winner of your competition. I am  looking forward to going to Camp California. I've never been to the States before and having the chance to do  so makes me really happy.
As I told you in my previous letter I finally had the opportunity to take part in the Sting concert here in Segovia. No, not as a singer. Not yet. My only role was to carry things from one place to another. Very heavy things, those which Sting uses to make his show even more spectacular. Have you seen the giant screen behind him in every concert? I was the one who put it there in Segovia. Well, some others helped me with the task, but that did not make it much easier.
The only  time for me to visit you is July. I can come to USA in July because in August I will be working with my father. We are building a new house for our family. What about accommodation? I prefer tents to log cabins. Nights  in July are hot. A tent will be cooler to sleep in than a cabin.
I appreciate these shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces. But the problem is when I want to buy only one thing, for example bread. On Friday evening and  on the weekdays all supermarkets are crowded. They are filled with people who want to buy everything.
Maybe you could explain to me what the problems were. By problems I mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available? But these are only little problems. The most disappointing thing was that there were different actors to those advertised who were not very good at acting. And after the show we didn't know what to do with the rest of the evening, because we actually wanted to go to the Theatre Restaurant after the show, but it was closed.
It wasn't really a perfect evening as you promised on your flyer. I was very disappointed and I would like to have my money back. Some people might be silly enough to pay for such a bad show. I will tell everyone I know how bad it was.
Unfortunately, modern technology has made  life for many people easier. If you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by horse and ship. Today, everyone has the opportunity to just get into a car and drive  wherever they want to. Modern technology also allows you to go onto the Internet to get any information you need. Production is much faster and cheaper than before, because you don't have to pay for the workers anymore. Everything is controlled and produced by machines. This is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs. The only and simple advantage of modern technology is just taking the work from us so we don't have to do anything anymore. Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they watch TV or play or work on the Computer and don't see each other anymore because they don't have to. You never get bored.
While I was staying in London, I went to see one of your musical shows, "Over The Rainbow", because I had read the ad in the newspaper, and I thought it would be an interesting experience. Let me tell you now how everything really was.
One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor, announced in the ad to be Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, after forty-five minutes' delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play. The ad also mentioned discounts, but that wasn't true either. After the play, which turned out to be just as bad as I thought, I wanted to relax in the Theatre Restaurant, but it was closed, and for no reason!
Regarding my accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin because it's more comfortable than a tent and less hot . However, I hope, there is water and light inside this log cabin.
From your different activities, I would like to practise:
2. Photography because in my free time I take some pictures of people, countryside, -- - So, I  want to have more experience and a better technique to
 I would like to know if it's possible to change my activities during my stay. Can I change some money at the camp or near it? Is it possible to come with another person? And are there different prices for the same holiday?
In England, . It's different to the other European countries.
I am writing to you, on behalf of all the students in my class, to tell you about our wish to change the London programme. I would also like to thank you for the excellent programme you organized for us, and in particular the river trip to Greenwich might be fascinating.
I would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: It is "The London Fashion and Leisure Show", which is going to take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th March, between 10.00 and 19.00. The latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown on this occasion. We think that this is a great opportunity because it takes place only once a year and, on top of all that, it is free for students.
The path we were walking on was quite clean and I was feeling really happy and relaxed... until we reached a river. There was neither a bridge nor a canoe. The only way to cross it was by walking on a big old tree trunk which was lying down, peacefully, making the only bridge between our side and the other.
I was also very pleased to hear that I could do some activities. Since I have studied photography for several years, I would like to take some pictures of beautiful scenery in California. After photography, swimming is my best method of relaxation. It would be great if I could go swimming during the stay.
To sum up, although there is certainly a good side to shopping, such as the pleasures of getting new stuff and spending money on something you really wanted for a long time, you also have some unpleasant moments to get through.
At this point, I would like to know which airline I will be travelling on and if it is possible can you send me more information about  Camp California. Also I would like to know how long I will be staying at this camp so I can decide how much money I'm going to need and how many clothes I'm going to take.
I think Science is one of the interesting subjects in school. It is very interesting and fun  experiment. Lots and lots of experiments  produce quite  interesting and amazing results and I think Science is very useful in life. We can see a lot of interested faces among the students while we are filming them. Also it is not a very easy subject so we can capture other students' faces in confusion and puzzlement.
Thirdly, regarding the activities I have to choose, I would prefer swimming and tennis. I have gained some experience in playing tennis due to the tennis court that we used to have at home. I do a lot of sports, so apart from playing tennis I am a member of our local swimming centre. I can assure you that I am gradually improving my sports skills.
As I've told you, last month I went to a pop concert and I really enjoyed helping with the preparation. It took place in a huge stadium which had over 4,000 seats for the "spectators" if you can call them that. Can you imagine?
Even if I could use 100 sheets it wouldn't be enough to describe my experience and the things that I gained from it! I've learned the meaning of the words "reliability" and "responsibility". Anyway the result of the whole preparation is  far more enjoyable and relaxing.
I am writing to you about your advertisement for the "London Fashion" and "Leisure Show". Thank you for organising this excellent programme, especially the Leisure show, which is very interesting to us. So all of our class would like to go to the show during their three days in London. But there is a problem which I hope you can solve.
Concerning your advertisement, we were pleased to learn that we can do some different activities in London, which include  sightseeing by bus, a River trip to Greenwich, visiting the Science Museum and National Art Gallery and so on. The point is, The London Fashion and Leisure show will be fantastic. At this we can see the latest fashions, imaginative make-up and hairstyles. What is more they are , which we are keen on seeing . In your advertisement, you have written "The show will be held in the Central Exhibition hall in London. It runs from 10 am to 7 pm on 14th March."
I am writing on behalf of our class to thank you for organising our trip to London. Our class is very grateful to you for the excellent programme. We are especially interested in the sightseeing by bus on Monday morning and the river trip to Greenwich in the afternoon. It is a good idea to include the visit to the Science Museum and the National Art Gallery in the morning  on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.
However, the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show at the Central Exhibition Hall of London on Tuesday from 10 am to 7 p.m. All of us would like to go to the show. It is a great opportunity for the following reasons. Firstly, there will be leisure and sports wear and the latest fashions. Secondly, there will be exhibitions about makeup and hairstyles. Moreover,  entrance for students is free.
In my opinion, each human being has a right to be free. We can go for a walk, go shopping, go to the cinema, get married or divorced. Why can't famous people do all these things? Why must everybody know and talk about their private life? The most important thing is that  famous people are also normal people like us. They live like us, they breathe and eat like us, they even fall in love like us. I think they should have a normal private life without journalists following them all the time and without any  details about them appearing in the different newspapers' .
In your advertisement I read the times of the performances, they were 14.30 and 10.30, however, it started at 20.15! So I was doing  nothing for a long time and I don't like to waste my time, and what about Danny Brook and Tina Truelove? Where were they  last weekend? Last weekend at the theatre there was a different actor who was disappointing. To make the evening worse there were no discounts available on the tickets, and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show because it was so late when the show was over.
I am writing to explain some aspects of your show. It was a disaster and I am going to tell you why.
To sum up, technology is the best thing in the world, apart from T.V.
Why did you put in the advertisement 'Discounts Available'? They weren't!!! All tickets were sold at the original price.
Within a week  my classmates and teachers started to talk about me. I knew who had told my secret to everyone. I got a bit depressed but my parents supported me. We had a long conversation. They stopped me having the operation.
I would like to travel in July because I will have my holiday in July. I would rather stay in a log cabin than a tent. I think it would be more comfortable than a tent. I want to attend swimming and tennis courses. I have been swimming since I was five years of age and until 1993 I was a member of the school team. I am good at . I am also good at playing tennis. I won a prize in a competition in 1999.
If you could reply to my letter by the 28th of June I'd be grateful  because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company.
We have a few possibilities. We can look in a magazine or a  which is delivered with the newspaper weekly. We can order a free catalogue from big shops or companies monthly. We can also watch some special channels on the television. The easiest and latest way is  internet shopping. So you don't need to see long-faced staff in the shops. You won't wait in the queue. You don't need to go out to buy something. You can order everything on the computer.
I have just received your letter and I would like to thank you for the two weeks in California I have won in the competition. California has always been in my dreams.
I look forward to hearing from you. Please do not hesitate to contact me on (0297) 8245123 in case you should need me.
I am writing to inquire whether it is possible to have more details about travel and to give my preferences regarding travel. Indeed I would rather travel only in July since I'm going to work in August in order to earn money to pay for my studies next year.
 I've chosen two activities from the list: tennis (as I do this sport regularly and I'm very good at this activity) and golf because I don't know anything about this sport and I wish   to find out about it .
Also I would suggest filming  lunch in the restaurant at twelve o'clock in order that people are aware of the high level of noise inside the restaurant because of the babbling.
Do you mind telling me what the weather will be like when I am on  holiday, what kind  money I should bring with me and what language I should speak  there?
When you go  shopping with your girlfriend, she wants to look at every item of clothing in the shopping centre, but you are not interested in that. Romantic, no! I think you will feel bored.
Then, the time stated as the beginning of the show was 19:30 and unfortunately it began at 20:15.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He has a best friend, who was more like a brother to him. They always did things together, and they were the most popular boys in school. Both were very handsome, played football; they were an example for everybody. That was before the day when Pat discovered that his brother was gay. After that their relationship changed. Pat was very frightened by this situation.
Unable to keep a secret he told  everyone, ended his friendship with Ted. Now Ted is rejected by everyone, no one talks to him and Pat is the example, but without his best friend and his honesty.
Thank you very much for your letter.
I would like to give you and the others in the class my opinion (concerning the video that you are going to make) about which lessons and other activities should be filmed and why.
Well, from my point of view the most interesting lessons that we have at school and which are useful in real life are maths because everything we do is all about maths. The other lesson that I think is very important is physics for the same reason that maths is important. On the other hand I think that geography is important as well because we should all know WHERE we live, what the problems are that we have in this world, what problem  every different country has and where  the petroleum comes from and what the advantages and disadvantages of using it are and about the gold as well. There are loads of things about geography that we OUGHT TO KNOW.
In accordance with all that I have written to you above I think that there is something else you must put in the video. You can put in a few activities (sports) like basketball, football, and tennis, but only those because they are very popular and people will be interested in them.
My name is German Schmidt and  last week I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". There were some problems we have to speak about.
First, the actor was not Danny Brook, there was a different actor, who I don't know. In the advertisement for the show it was written that the musical would  start at 19:30, but it started at 20:15.
After the  show I wanted to spend some time in your theatre restaurant but it was not open, because all of your cooks and waiters are on holiday.
First I will say that our level of technology at the present time is very high but in the future it will be higher.
One example in my life is home banking. With the help of my home computer I can do all kinds of things, with money, with my bank. Some years ago I had to go to the bank. The new way is very easy and faster and I can spend my time on other things. Another example is the modern technology in my car. Because of  modern technology, the safety level of my car is very high.
I'm sorry to say this, but your musical show was very disappointing to me. I was very disappointed. A lot of things that you wrote in the advertisement are not true.
Also the show did not start at half past seven  as it  said but at eight  fifteen . Everyone get bored waiting for the show to start.
I am also wondering why you told us to visit your theatre restaurant after the show, as it was closed. After the show everyone ran to get a good seat in the restaurant but everyone was disappointed when they saw the sign which said "Closed for today".
It was Saturday when I called her and asked her to go for a walk in the park, which was not very far away from our houses. I had never told her a secret before but this time I was going to tell her. The secret was about our friend Maria who was very kind to everyone. I told her that I had heard that Maria had . Pat told me that she would not tell that to anyone but the other day I learnt that all the school knew about Maria.
I was sure that it was Pat who told   everyone. After that I had an argument with Pat and then she told me that she told  only  one person. I was very sad about what Pat had done and I didn't speak to her for a long time.
My name is Agripina T. I just received your letter and I would like to answer and ask some questions. I would like to travel only in July because it's the only month when I'm free. In June I have to take some English lessons. I would prefer to stay in log cabins because I think they are more comfortable than tents. I don't really like staying in tents. If it's possible to stay in log cabins I'll be pleased. While I'm at the Camp, I would like to do two of my favourite activities, which are basketball and singing. I love to play basketball. I'm not good at it but I try my best. In the past I was in a basketball team and I enjoyed it a lot. Also I like singing. In future I would like to be a singer. I like this kind of activity. There is something else I would like to ask. At the Camp, is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special? Also I would like to ask about money. How much money should I take with me? And is it necessary to bring money, will we need it?
I suggest filming our English lessons and Maths lessons. From the activities I suggest filming sports lessons and music lessons. We have very interesting English lessons. They are always funny and nice. We always learn something new. At some lessons students are always working, but as we work, we joke, discuss many topics, tell some stories about our life. Students think that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special. It's not true. We practise our English and I think we have to film our English lessons, so others can see that to study this way is better than to study the way  they do. Also Maths lessons are so interesting. Many people don't like Maths because they think that it's a boring subject. I think it all depends on the teacher. Our Maths teacher knows how to teach so we don't get tired of his lessons. I think we should film the Maths lessons, so students and some teachers will change their opinion about Maths. For activities, we should film sports lessons because we always do something new. We have many competitions with other schools, and we always have fun. Our music lessons are special. We try to play  many instruments, and sing even if we don't know how. And it's always interesting to watch others while they do something like that.
I went to your show to see Mr. Danny Brook, who was supposed to play the main character, but he didn't appear. He had been replaced by a really bad actor, of whom I don't even know the name. I was very disappointed with that change, because Mr. Brook is one of my favourite actors.
In my opinion modern technology has changed my life a lot. First of all, if computers hadn't been invented, I wouldn't spend half of the day in front of one! I use my computer for many things, such as homework, games, digital video or the Internet.
First of all I can go to Camp California only in July because I will start working at our local leisure centre as a swimming instructor .
I would like to stay in a log cabin because I have had bad experiences with tents. I do not like to stay in such a small space.
Also they have lots of special offers on everything, you can even join their clubs for extra discount. It seems wonderful doesn't it?
I have recently received a letter saying I am the first-prize winner in your competition. It was wonderful news and as you have requested, here is some further information and details.
I would say window shopping is the reason why I have no money now. Sometime last month, I was just the same as I am now, with no money. My friend wanted to meet up with me so we made plans to meet up on a high street to go shopping. For me, that meant window shopping. When we went into the first shop, I caught sight of a long black dress. As I had nothing better to do, I tried it on. I fell in love with it. I knew though that I couldn't get it - not yet anyway.
I'm writing this letter to you because I had a very disappointing evening at your theatre and I would like to explain what the problems were.
Firstly,  I read in the advertisement that the actor would be Danny Brook, and this is one of the reasons why I went to the theatre. But  I had a  big surprise when I saw that it was a different actor, and I was very disappointed.
Secondly, according to the  the times were 14:30 and 19:30. I preferred to go at 19:30 because it is better at night and it wouldn't finish late, but the show started at 20:15 and we got bored waiting for it to start.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The next morning at school everybody was looking at me in a strange way. Nobody was talking to me except the ten people who I invited to my party.
After much confusion, I decided not to have a party for my birthday so I could get all my friends back. And that's exactly what I did even though I was alone on my birthday. It was much more important to me to get all my friends back.
From this experience I learnt that there are a few friends who are real friends  whom you can trust.
I was interested in the advertisement for the musical show so I went to the theatre to see it two weeks ago. However, I cannot help saying that it was really a nightmare.
It is certainly true that  modern technology has been changing our life a lot  these days. But how does it affect  my daily life? I get up in the morning with the soft sound of a radio programme, not the sound of an alarm clock and eat my breakfast watching TV news. On the bus or even on the tube, I can talk with a friend via a mobile phone when I feel bored. Sometimes I even play some games on it.  study or work, I use the Internet, which is the easiest way to get information from all around the world. Furthermore, I can write a letter to my friend who is abroad in such a short time. Without it, it would take more than one week. After comming home, I can make myself relaxed with the smooth sound of classical music from the Hi-Fi. In conclusion, modern technology affects my daily life a lot as well as the whole society. And in my opinion the extent of its affect on  human life will be more than this in the future.
I was angry about all of these problems but I was disappointed when I realised the advertisement was wrong about the actor's name.
The Internet has changed our daily life: you can find whatever you want. Do you want to have a different lunch? Do you want to organize a different holiday to a strange place? You can find all you need there and more!
And what about mobile telephones? Changes won't stop  coming : the WAP technology (you'll buy a cake from a vending machine without any coins, only one call), digital TV, virtual reality and more...
My sister's birthday was coming. Her friends and I decided to present her with the thing she had been dreaming of for a long time - a puppy. We knew it would be a great present and she would be extremely happy. But the most important thing was that it would be really surprising for her, because she could hardly  expect such a present.
Firstly, I was looking forward to seeing Danny Brook, as written in the advertisement, but his part was played by another actor, without any information or explanation being given by the management. Secondly, I couldn't get a discount with my student card and the show started 45 minutes late. In addition, the theatre restaurant, where we had planned to eat, was closed because the cook was ill.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The poor boy was only 5 years old and at this age it's very difficult to keep your mouth shut knowing an important secret. So when he heard by chance that my parents were planning to give me a trip to San Fansisco as a present for my birthday, my little brother ran into my bedroom where I was studying and whispered the wonderful news in my ear. I knew they wanted to send me to America because they didn't want me to spend the summer with my boyfriend Fred, whom they didn't appreciate. But Fred booked a seat on a plane to San Fransisco and that's why, even if I didn't look delighted when my mum gave me my ticket for America, I had been looking forward to going with Fred for one month already.
I would like to go in July after taking my examination at  college at the end of June. So it is impossible for me to go earlier.
I hope you will take immediate action on this. I look forward to hearing from you in the future.
Hello. I'm Robert and I'm writing  an article about clothes in the future. In my opinion, in a hundred  years we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays. What will change with clothes will be how comfortable they are and the way they protect us and our bodies from temperature and physical attacks. I think they will cool us in the summer and make us warmer in the winter. Clothes will be more personalized and they'll make us feel better and more free. Wearing them we'll be able to dive underwater at high pressure, and we'll have freedom of movement. Technology will play a part in clothes' development, scientists will find a way to reduce the weight of clothes and they will become very light and comfortable, so I want to be in the future to enjoy the clothes. I hope I win the trip!
I received your letter and I'm very happy because I didn't expect it, so first of all I want you to know that I really  going to Camp California in the U.S.A. for two weeks,  especially because I've never been to this country.
On the one hand I would like to travel in July because I'm working in a school and the lessons finish at the end of June so if I could take this extraordinary opportunity in July it would be better for me because in August I will have to be ready to begin preparing the exams for September. If it is any problem let me know as soon as possible because I'll try to sort it out.
Finally I want to find out  if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
I was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and I couldn't help it and I started crying - you can imagine, they were so handsome that I couldn't believe it - I tried to calm down because I had to work, and later I began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast - although I was working - and it was like a dream.
CONCERNING THE ACCOMMODATION - PLEASE BE INFORMED THAT I WOULD PREFER THE LOG CABIN AS  I SHOULD WORK ON MY LAPTOP, PREPARING SOME FINANCIAL REPORTS SO  ELECTRICITY WILL BE NEEDED. I THINK THAT THE LOG CABIN WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE OVER ALL. REGARDING TWO ACTIVITIES - I HAVE CHOSEN TENNIS AND PHOTOGRAPHY. I JUST STARTED TO PLAY TENNIS. THAT IS WHY I THINK IT WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY TO PRACTISE AND CHECK MY SKILLS. PHOTOGRAPHY IS MY HOBBY.
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T LIKE DOING SHOPPING AT ALL. THE REASONS ARE; DISTANCE, LACK OF CAR, CROWDED STREETS, TRAFFIC ON THE WAY TO THE SHOP. THEY CAN SAY ,,SHOPPING IS NOT ENJOYABLE'' BECAUSE THEY PREFER TO ORDER CLOTHES AND FOOD FROM CATALOGUES OR IN THE PIZZA HUT RESTAURANT SITUATED ON THE CORNER. THEY ARE TOO LAZY FOR WALKING AND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING NICE FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT OR FLOWERS FOR GIRLFRIENDS. ON THE OTHER HAND - IT'S VERY COMFORTABLE TO SIT AT HOME, CALL AND WAIT FOR THE ORDER . PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE SHOPPING HAVE THEIR OWN REASONS FOR THIS SITUATION (MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT WITH A RUDE SHOP ASSISTANT, BOUGHT NOT FRESH FOOD ONE DAY AND DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT ANY MORE, HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER PEOPLE IN SHOPS). THEY DON'T LIKE SHOPPING EITHER BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER (SOMETIMES IT'S TOO HOT OR TOO COLD FOR GOING OUTSIDE).
Thank you for your letter. I'd like to go on holiday for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I can go only in July because I'm a student. It's summer holiday at that time. I want to know if it is available at that time.
I have just received your letter and, firstly, I would like to thank you for this good news. I will give you the information which you asked me for in your letter and also I will ask you some questions.
To answer  your question about activities, I am going to choose tennis and swimming. I am quite good at tennis, especially playing doubles. Also I like swimming and I've got two years' experience of teaching swimming at a leisure centre.
Shopping is part of my life. Sometimes I hate it. I can't  concentrate in a shop, and I can't relax either. I am looking on the shelves but I'm not able to find anything from my shopping list. Everybody is pushing me and I think that I came to the wrong place.
On the other hand, I understand very well that it is really necessary. I also understand that nobody will do that in my place. However, everybody in my family will open their mouths and won't just ask to eat, they will ask me for something special and tasty.
I am writing this letter to inform you I had a very disappointing evening at your musical show "Over the rainbow" at the Circle Theatre where you are the director.
And finally the play started with a delay of forty-five minutes and there were no discounts available. Neither thing agrees with what I read in your advertisement.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. But I didn't know that when I told her I was thinking of leaving home.
And sometimes, for example, you just bought something last week, but when you go shopping this week, you see the same items but different prices, maybe from Â£50 down to Â£20, and then you'll regret wasting money, although you like it very much. If you are a rich man it doesn't mater, but if you are a poor man, you will be sad! How can shopping be enjoyable in this situation!
I'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show "Over the Rainbow" which I saw yesterday. I have to say that I'm very disappointed with what I saw because after seeing your advertisement I expected more. The show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement .
Most houses have many electric devices like a microwave , an oven, a mixer, a dishwasher and many other things which can do a job at the press of a button.
I am writing with reference to a visit I made to your theatre  last week.
I have to admit that it was not as I expected; First of all, the main reason I went to see "Over the Rainbow" was its actor, Danny Brook. It was very disappointing when I realised he wasn't on the stage. Besides this, I had to wait three quarters of an hour before the show started. During this time, I decided to have a drink in the restaurant but, as well as being closed, there was  nobody from the staff that could help me. I couldn't believe it! I would never have imagined this could happen in such a well-known theatre. Furthermore, you talk about discounts in your leaflets and there were none available, so, it was an expensive evening!
I won't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my Mum the truth about my strange disease. He just said there weren't resources to cure it at that moment but... I burst into tears as did my Mother. It seemed the end of something lovely, step by step. I became conscious of my problem and despite being a personal matter I decided to tell Pat about it. I still remember her words: "Don't worry about anything. My lips are sealed".
As for your questions, I am free to travel only in July because I will have my holiday after finishing the exams. And, I have to return to my university by August.
Furthermore, I prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and  fascination for art and enjoy taking  photographs of wildlife.
Finally, please could you give me an idea what sort of clothes to bring? And how much will  I spend there? Also, please advise me regarding any things it is necessary to prepare and bring.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I say this because of the experience I've had with her.
Actually, we were quite good friends before this event happened. Pat has been studying in the same class with me  this year. She sat next to me. We started to chat more and more. Then we became good friends. One day, we were sitting in the dinning-hall as usual. Suddenly my heart was thumping so quickly because I saw him - a boy who was a new student. I know this is . I'm absolutely besotted with him. Then I told this to Pat and told her to keep it secret: I didn't want people gossiping about me  everyone would know I fancied him. But the thing which I'd never expected happened, which is that Pat betrayed me. She told everyone that I fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it. That makes me feel so embarrassed: I was very angry at that time!
Firstly, the show started at 20:15 not at 19.30 so I had to wait for 45 minutes in my seat, so it made me upset. Secondly, I was very disappointed as soon as the actors showed up on stage because they were not the actors who you advertised. Thirdly, you state that there are discounts available but I could not get any reductions at all.
I would rather travel in July because I'm not as busy as in June or August and because in my opinion during July there's excellent weather.
Regarding your activities, I have picked basketball, because I love it: I play in a local club and I have been playing for twelve years, so I guess I am a "good" player. I have also chosen photography from your list.  That part of California must be beautiful and I would love to bring home some "well-taken" photos of the area.
I suggest you listen to it because it's a very interesting book and you can relax while someone else is reading to you.
I am writing to you on behalf of an advanced class to thank you for having organised our  three-day programme from 13th to 15th March.
We discussed the programme. It would be great to take a trip to Greenwich by boat. We all would love to do it. However, we have seen an advertisement for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" recently. It will be held at Central Exhibition Hall on 14th March at 10 a.m to 7 p.m.. According to the advertisement, a lot of events will take place during the show such as make-up, hairstyles, latest fashions and leisure and sports wear. It would be a golden opportunity to see up-to-date fashion. In addition, it is free for students.
On the other hand, other people are against following celebrities and photographing them every moment. They claim that it is absolutely an intrusion on their privacy. What is more, they insist that as well as celebrities, they are also human beings who want to live without being disturbed and watched.
In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to covering celebrities. Taking everything into account, the drawbacks far outweigh its benefits. Thus, I think that journalists should consider celebrities' lives and put themselves in celebrities' shoes. 
In reply to your letter, I would like to say that I was really pleased with the first prize. It was a real surprise for me.
I see people who run the camp are very good at organizing the social life of their guests. I have a lot of possibilities for spending my spare time. The climbing and the painting are preferred by me the most. Generally I paint some landscapes by using  watercolours, but sometimes I try to paint like during the impressionist era by using blobs, oil paint and canvases.
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and other activities should be shown in the video film about daily life at our school.
Some of the teachers are very good  professionals. Their lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny. For example, the teacher of history and Polish language is able to interest students in the subject in different ways.
On the whole our school has a lot of different possibilities for the students that we can show in our film. It could make the video more interesting. I recommend showing our history teacher. It will show that during every day we have  great fun and we receive  good, important knowledge.
And if this were not enough, I got no discount on the ticket such as was advertised. Besides this, we were invited to visit the theatre restaurant after the show, but it was closed because it was being redecorated. So why did you make this invitation?
Firstly, one advantage of it is that you can do things faster. Beside this you can talk with a person on the other side of the world via a computer. It is interesting! Furthermore it helps with housework, at school and you can travel to places very quickly. So the main advantage of  modern technology is that things are becoming easier and easier.
On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks. First and foremost is the pollution and big cities are suffering with it. It can cause lots of problems for our health. A further disadvantage is that children are growing up very lazy. They get everything they want very easily and it is not good for their future.
To sum up, there are both positive and negative aspects to  modern technology, because it can make our lives easy but at the same time it is causing lots of problems for us.
I have received your letter and I would like to reply to it.
Secondly, I would like to choose Swimming and Tennis as activities. I belonged to a swimming club and I got second prize in a competition last summer. I am good at tennis as well as swimming.
However, shopping sometimes makes them stressed. People often waste money on worthless things. Then, they really regret it. On the other hand, after they buy something, they find a better one. In addition, a shop assistant gives them  wrong advice.
I am writing to say how happy I am to be able to take part in "Camp California in the USA". I would like to inform you that I am able to go there only in July. I am finishing my studies in June, then I have a month off (July) and on August 1st I am starting a new job.
I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed. I'm not from here (this city), so I wanted to know everything about it: its culture, history and the famous musicals. Everything was perfect and beautiful till yesterday. Yesterday I wanted to go to the theatre to see a musical . I went to the theatre to see  what time the show was, 19.30. That was OK so I bought a ticket. At that moment my problems began. I couldn't get any discount; that meant that the advertisement was wrong, but I bought the ticket anyway. Then I had to wait 45 minutes; the show started at 20:15. Then Danny Brook wasn't acting, there was a different actor. At that moment I was really angry, so to calm down I went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed, because of its bad hygiene and food. That was too much. "Dear" manager I hope you understand me, and I ask for money back and I hope this won't happen again. Bye
First of all, I think we have grown up with  technology. It's difficult for us to recognise the changes in our lives, but we can think about them. How has it changed my daily life? Well, in one word it made my life more comfortable. Now I only need to push a button, and things or machines work on their own. Homework is easier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes. Everything is faster, and sometimes technology goes so fast that I'm unable to follow it. Modern technology showed us that we could do anything we wanted to, and it makes us think more about our future jobs. Maybe, I won't be able to understand how the things work and that scares me. I will be useless, because a machine will do all the work.
Clothes are a very interesting subject to study. If you travel around you can see a lot of difference still between different cultures.
I'm writing in order to let you know how angry I am after having gone to one of your shows.
What  moved me to discover this were the events that happened last month. I had just quarrelled with Jon, who is my fiance. At that time we weren't getting on with each other. So, when Peter, who has been a friend of mine since we were children, invited me for a pizza, I accepted without thinking of the consequences.
Talking of my work, I mostly had two prepare the concert stage with some . If you chose the post, you would be thoroughly exhausted at the end of the concert. However, there was a particular thing I really liked during the concert. As I could take a rest beside the concert stage while someone was singing a song, I saw a number of famous musicians nearby.
During the holiday I would do surfing and photography. I like very much to be alone with nature and when I was a girl, I went on a surfing course for five years and I won a lot of prizes. I also like  photography because .
I particularly liked meeting people from different countries and some pop-stars, who were friendly towards us. I was surprised at the co-operation that there was , because it was like a big family, where each member helps the others.
As you asked me I will write to you about the experience I had helping at the pop concert. All the children helped as much as they could and that's why the result was beautiful . Before the concert I helped with carrying and putting in order some chairs on which some special people would sit. It was very hard and at the end I was very tired. At the concert, what I had to do was to give out refreshments and drinks to the audience. I also helped to clear up the place after the concert.
I am very good at playing basketball. When I was a child I used to play daily with my classmates and now I play at least every weekend. I have taken a Photography course and I enjoy taking photos of animals.
Anyway, it has been one of the most wonderful experiences of my life, but the day of the concert was really amazing. I think this was the best of all. I feel really happy that I participated in this event.
I was at first, very excited to be seeing the show, because in the advertisement it said that it is the best musical in London. Also it said that I could have a perfect evening  there, but it turned out to be a very disappointing evening.
I went to see my favourite actor, Danny Brook, acting in the show, but he was not there. I was shocked. There was another man acting. The show started later than I expected. It should run from 7.30 p.m., but it started at 8.15 p.m.!
I want to complain about the ticket. In the advertisement it said that discounts were available, but when I asked a member of staff in the theatre about the discount he didn't offer me one. After the show I went to the 'THEATRE RESTAURANT' to have dinner, but the restaurant was closed. It was because they closed earlier than usual. I think they should .
Right now in 2000 many people are wearing modern clothes, like  T-shirts, trousers, skirts, coats, long-sleeved shirts, jumpers, etc. They also wear little items on them to go with their clothes, like earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, glasses, hair bands, handbags, shoes, watches, etc. They like designer clothes and everyone wears different modern clothes in terms of size,  colour and  shape.
For the special gas they will mix carbon dioxide and some chemicals. This special gas will not be dangerous. If we use  carbon dioxide in our balloon clothes there will be less carbon dioxide on Earth, so there is no worry about . This is one more reason to wear balloon clothes in the future. It will save our Earth.
On the 12th of June this year I went to London to visit a friend of mine. We had a great time together until we decided to visit the musical "Over the Rainbow" at the "Circle Theatre". We went there at 19.00 o'clock to get some tickets, but, when we arrived, a long line of people were standing there, waiting to get tickets. After we waited for half an hour to get two spare seat tickets, we had to wait 45 minutes until it started. One of the reasons why I wanted to see the musical was my favourite actor Danny Brook, but he didn't appear! So when the miserable musical came to its end, we were happy to leave the theatre auditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurants were open anymore, because it started too late. So we went upstairs to find the restaurant, but we just found a big empty hall, with nothing in it, with a small sign on a door: "Sorry, we are closed for renovations"! We thought it  was a joke, but it wasn't. Because you are the manager, I think you are the only person who can change anything. I would prefer to get my money back, instead of getting a lawyer. I will never visit your theatre again!
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. And we knew that from that day on that if he knew anything about our secret we would live in danger of being caught. We, that is Tim, Gudrun, Paul and me, Hedwiga, had founded our own mafia, we were the kings in our small town, and we had a lot of people paying us money, so that we wouldn't attack them. We had this idea first when we watched a movie about the Italian mafia in an English lesson in school. It was love at first sight and we were fascinated by the thought of building  the same kind of organisation in our town. Pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "safety-money", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of money in my room. His mind made up and ready to go to the police he left our house, where me and my friends were just hanging out. He saw me and told me to my face, "You are a thief and a burglar and I will now go to the police." I didn't know what to do ,but then I had an idea.... Yeah folks, that was the point I got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "Rossall-School-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
Finally, I would like to ask you whether there is anything I should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
First of all, I'd like to travel only in July because I'm supposed to be a volunteer at the Music festival, held in August.
 70% of students said that the acting lesson should be filmed as the students attending this lesson, are not only excited but also very active. Additionally, 15% of students answered that they want the presentation lesson to be filmed. The reason why they choose this lesson is that every student in their turn at presentation does his or her best.
The soccer game, played every Monday, was ranked as the most popular activity by 45% of students. They said the soccer game enables them to get together and have fun. However, the girls would rather play table tennis or badminton.  activity was chosen by 20% of students, followed by the soccer.
So, we can change your programme a little bit . On Monday afternoon we have the river trip to Greenwich, as you have written in your programme. On Tuesday morning we go to the show and after that shopping. And on Wednesday morning we go to the National Art Gallery, and after that we can go to the Science Museum, in the afternoon.
I believed everything she told me. And said just be careful. But for three days she didn't come home. She disappeared! We called the police. They advised us to wait. But we couldn't just sit and wait! We had to do something. After three days of  the phone rang. I picked up the phone. Someone told me if I wanted to see my friend, I must get 5000$ and take it out onto the street. I took some paper, put it into a bag and without saying anything went to my friend to get something that looked like a gun. The friend gave me his toy gun and I went onto the street. There I saw a man and my friend. I showed the man that I had a gun and money. I was surprised that he believed me. Of course, it was better for us. I gave him the bag, took my friend's hand and we ran away. After that she told me that the man was the boy who she had met.
It was so great to hear that I had won first prize. It would be meaningful in my life to take part in your camp. I am writing to reply to your questions.
I would like to travel to the Camp in July, if  possible. This is just one month which I have free.
Another sport which I'd like to do is swimming. I'm not as good at swimming as I am at basketball, but I'd like to practise more and maybe learn something new about it.
How are you? I'm fine. I'm so excited. Last month I was helping at a pop concert with a few friends of mine. It was a Tina Turner concert! At this moment when I think of it I want to shout.
According to your letter, I have two options regarding accommodation, either in tents or log cabins. I would prefer a tent because I think that is something more exciting and new for me. I have never stayed in a tent in the middle of nowhere in my life so I would prefer something more realistic and new. Log cabins may be more comfortable.  On the other hand I think that I will be able to "survive" in a tent. Looking at your letter, I can see many options for activities and I realize that I like most of them. I think I would prefer Climbing and Painting. The reason for choosing these two activities is that they contrast with each other. I want one that is more exciting and that asks for more agility and another that is calmer and relaxing, that asks only for my ability to paint. Climbing is something new for me and I am not so good at it, however, I hope that I can learn about it at the Camp. Painting is something that I love and I am very good at it.
There was a concert with a famous band here in my city. I wish you had been here with me. So, I went with my friend to the concert with a lot of fans. We bought tickets to the show and also to the fans' bus. Yes, there is a bus that takes you to the concert and brings you back.
AT 20:00, we stopped at a coffee house to eat. They shouted: "20:30 you all have to be back because the bus will leave."
We sat and started to eat and talk. Suddenly a man came and started to tell us his adventures. They were very interesting and we liked him very much. After a few minutes (I thought they were a few) I realized that the coffee house was empty. I looked at my watch: 20:45. The bus had left about fifteen minutes before. The man offered us a ride. We accepted. You cannot imagine how disappointed I was with myself.
We started to put everything on the stage and after this we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
The vocalist of the Almendegos was by my side and he touched my arm. I will never wash my arm again. After all of this we saw the show from the best place, near  the stage and afterwards, the thing that I most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
Science and technology can give us a better lifestyle or better food. For example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them. We can also produce more and better food by using science and technology, e.g. by using science to put all the good parts of two plants into one plant. We can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow faster.
Science and technology can also be used to produce some materials, e.g. steel or iron, which are used in our buildings. They can make them stronger and hard to destroy.
Also, you wrote about discounts, but it was not true! The woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me, actually she started swearing at me.
Two days later, in the morning, a policeman came to see Peter... So, now my best friend is a prisoner. All the time, I am thinking about Peter. I don't forget him. He will be in  prison for 5 years. By the way, I haven't seen Pat for about one year. Perhaps, he moved to another town. It's good that he is far away... I miss Peter very much, it's unfair to put him in a prison. But it's life, destiny, very cruel destiny...
My daily life: I get up early in the morning, go to school, then come home and do what I would like to do. I go shopping, watch TV, walk around the city, use my computer and get lost on the Internet etc.
Modern technology is everywhere in my life. I don't see it on a normal day, but when I sit and think, it's everywhere!
For example, I get up whenever I want using my watch or clock. It's not a good example of modern technology, but it's a piece of technology at least!
A wonderful example of modern technology: the computer! It is not a living thing but it has a brain. It knows more than most   people.
In conclusion, shopping is not always enjoyable as many people think. It depends on the situation. It even varies depending on the people whom you shop with.
I'm writing to you to make a complaint about the very disappointing evening I had at the Circle Theatre.
I can't remember waking up without the alarm-clock, making a hand-made orange juice or heating water for the coffee. Therefore, I have more spare time to enjoy the one thing I consider to be the most important influence technology has had on my life: the computer and Internet.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have 2 weeks off at the beginning of the month.
I am writing on behalf of the whole class. First of all, I want to thank you for the interesting programme which you have already organised. It is very good, especially the sightseeing tour by bus.
However, we saw an advertisement in yesterday's newspaper for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00 at Central Exhibition Hall in London. There we will be able to see everything connected with the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. Entry for students is free.
This is a great opportunity because as you know most people in our class are going to work in this sector so it would be very interesting for everybody and also a kind of education.
For example, if you look back to the forties and compare  homes then with nowadays, you can see that they have become more modern, especially the equipment in the kitchen and in the living room.
In the future it is possible that you won't have to prepare your breakfast  yourself , perhaps you will just have to press a button when your alarm clock has gone off. In addition to this, you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping. Maybe they will also be your life partners.
In general we can see the huge changes we have already had, but who knows exactly what the future will bring for us?
One of the biggest things that have changed is the change in the methods of communication. People have invented such things as TV, radio, telephones and so on which made us able to hear the news quickly and stay in touch with people easily.
I have mentioned a few changes above but there's still the biggest one left, which is related to the field of computers. It helped us to be able to work much more quickly and accurately than before with the help of the Internet.
The idea of making the festival "international" was very good. I could find the opportunity to watch  artists from different countries, but there could have been stars from more than 6 countries. The jazz, classical and rock concerts were great despite some of the concert halls being too small. The plays and films I watched were also excellent, but more could be on the stage next year. I attended the art exhibitions and saw interesting pictures. The dance shows were a sight for our sore eyes; they were really fascinating. I learned so many things about the writers and their ideas, not to mention their lifestyles, by talking to them. In addition to all that, the idea of joining in all the activities with one  ticket was excellent because it saved you from having to buy one ticket for each activity. Next year, I think you should increase the number of shows, concerts and other things, and also the time spent at the festival (for example: at least 5 days), then everything would be perfect.
The things you wrote about the rules made me think for a long time and I understood that some really don't make any sense! The more you obey the rules, the better person you are! Our school is really very disciplined, especially about our clothes and behaviour. I understand the second part, but I can't understand the reason for only wearing white and dark blue. Do we become the "perfect one" then? Then again, we have to obey all these rules. It can be said that I'm much freer at home. I'm allowed to do whatever I want in my room. I can't go out at nights easily, but that is not something that I mind about. There are three main things that are very important for my family: respect, honesty and trust. I think I show these three to them.
I want to know what kind of clothes I have to wear because I don't know how the weather is in the U.S.A. Also I would like to know how much money I have to bring on the trip.
My job was very easy. I had to help Sting with everything, for example, if he wanted water, I had to give  him water. It was marvellous. He was very kind to me. We talked about many things and after the concert he invited all the team to have  dinner. Yes, I know what you're thinking, "Dinner and Sting". Yes, my friend, it was the best thing to happen to me in my life. I understood everything he said and Sting said to me that I spoke English very well. The best thing was I spoke in English  and I met my favourite singer.
To sum up I would like to say that for me it is very difficult to decide which group is right but, for the moment, we should try to respect each other and .
From the activities, I would choose painting - which I am keen on and I have done several courses - and Photography - about which I know just the basic skills.
With the increase in violence, more and more people are leaving the streets to spend their free time shopping - usually in shopping centres.
First, most areas in shopping centres use artificial illumination and air conditioning, which are bad for our health. Queues and lots of people going round can be stressful and tiring.
Besides, it was confirmed by scientists that consumerism may develop into a compulsion. There are cases of people that cannot spend one day without buying anything.
In the advertisement there's no mention of getting any money back but I think it was such a disappointing evening that you should give some back to me.
Last summer, I was spending my holidays in a little village on the southern coast of Spain with my friend Pat.
As it was so beautiful, we decided to go back to the beach at night to see the moon, the sea and the stars.
When we arrived at the beach, we saw a suspicious light and two people doing something we couldn't see very well. In order to see it, we got closer to them and, in the end, we saw that they had stolen a lot of money and they were trying to put it in a safe place. As it seemed dangerous we agreed that we shouldn't tell anybody about it. It was our secret.
Secondly the play didn't start at 19:30 as we were told but it started after a delay of 45 minutes. Also when I visited the theatre's restaurant I found it closed for renovation.
Finally there were no discounts available on the tickets. All the above made my night terribly disappointing and I must say that the advertisement is nothing but a business fraud, so I'm in the unpleasant position of asking for my money back. I'm looking forward to your reply.
Technology is an essential part of people's lives. It's something absolutely necessary for every action people perform. It affects us both positively and negatively. It's a part of our lives. Firstly technology has created a bond between myself and my computer. I've got used to spending 2-3 hours in front of the computer. My relationship with my family and friends doesn't even exist. I've ended up being a TV addict.
Despite the negative effects, technology can affect a person's life in a positive way. Air conditioning, watches, computers, and many other things have made my life easier. There's no need  to go to the shops when I can order things on the computer. Air conditioning also makes my life easier.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
I arrived in Paris on New Year's Eve 2000 without a place to stay, not speaking any French, alone and with a small amount of money. But in spite of all of these disadvantages , I was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything I was going to do it.
So suddenly, a week later I found myself a job as an au pair, taking care of two little girls that only spoke French at that time. It took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and I feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
Furthermore, the main actor was changed for another and nobody told us. When there was an intermission we went to the restaurant which was closed because it was late. We couldn't have a drink. Well I believe that it was a bad day but I would like you to give me my money back because in the advertisement there were some things that we didn't have in the theatre.
We have more researchers than a few years ago and we will be able to find the solution to lots of problems. Actually, we can cure illnesses which were once very dangerous. I'm sure that in a couple of years we will see some illnesses like cancer and UTH cured.
These days we are living in a high-technology world. Modern technology has been advancing rapidly and it has affected me a lot. Indeed, I have to save more money  to upgrade my personal computer. Computer technology keeps improving all the time and consumers like you and me definitely have to spend our money to keep our personal computer up to date and capable of working with the new computer software that requires more and more .
I shall have a look at the place I believe no one can avoid - the kitchen.
How much effort and time it took about two decades ago to chop vegetables or prepare coffee or how hard it was to deal with fridges! But today the mixer or some more complicated kitchen-device will chop and mix anything for you from fruits to meat, and modern coffee machines can even make a cappuccino or whatever you want on their own. Those devices have made our life easier as old fridges had to be defrosted and new fridges use a different kind of cooling system and will tell you if you have forgotten to close the door! The modern cooker will turn itself off if something goes wrong! Personally, my life became much faster and I have much more time for many other things during the day thanks to the devices modern technology offers us.
This show will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday 14 of March between 10.00 - 19.00,  includes the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles.
So, that afternoon at lunchtime, I went into the teachers' room and opened her desk and took the paper out quietly and calmly. Finally, I was successful in doing that. I took it to copy and returned it  without anyone seeing me.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and so his whole school knew about Sara's experience.
One day she had to do the shopping for her mother. She had to buy a lottery ticket and other things for her. After she had done this she went home, but she didn't buy the ticket because she thought there wasn't any chance of winning. She spent the money  on a magazine.
After she came home her mother was sitting in front of the TV and looked at the lottery numbers. Suddenly she jumped out of her armchair and shouted: "I have won the jackpot". Sara was out of breath and after  she told her mother she hadn't bought the ticket. Her mother got angry but some hours later she was friendly again.
Sara couldn't understand the fact that she didn't do the right thing. She had lost a lot of money, so she would be more careful about doing things .
I would like to inform you that the idea was great and I hope that  will become a good tradition in our country. I think that providing such festivals could help people to be at the centre of cultural life of the world and to have enough information about  new artistic styles.
But I hope that next year visitors to the festival will be able to be introduced to more art groups from all over the world. I suggest it would be very interesting to meet artists from faraway and exotic countries.
Also, if I were you I would make your concert halls a bit larger, because  very many people would like to spend their holidays with their families at your festival next year.
All those discos, concerts, and tourist trips have to be paid for with  different sums of those small coloured pieces of paper called money
The most common way to earn money is babysitting. Many young people earn their pocket money in this way, helping parents in the neighbourhood to have a bit more spare time. Other students work as house or office managers, sell different goods or even work as  bouncers. Naturally, it's easier to get a job when you are good at foreign languages or computers. Then you can find yourself work as a tourist guide or as a secretary.
The reason I am writing this letter is to congratulate you on the International Arts Festival. I think the festival was fine but in my opinion there should be some improvements to make this festival better.
Firstly, there were stars and artists from only six countries. This number should be increased to attract more and different people. Also some concert halls were too small for this many people. In contrast with the halls, the concerts were great and I saw everybody enjoyed then. I must admit that you were very successful at finding good stars.
there were not very many films and plays. As a result of this there were not enough kinds of films. In order to attract more people with different interests, the films and plays should be increased. I have nothing to say about the dance show, art exhibitions and talks by writers. They were excellent and they attracted all kinds of people.
I was so glad to receive your last letter because I'd started to think that you were angry with me for not writing for a long time. I promise I'll write more.
The school rules are horrible here. We are restricted in doing nearly everything. The school is like a dungeon here. I don't want to be so evil about school but  rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school.
Modern technology like the Internet, for example, has changed my life a lot both in good and bad ways. The advantage of the Internet is that I can do all my shopping over the Internet. I don't have to mess around in the supermarket on a Friday evening, when I'm tired from school, I just get all the groceries I need delivered to my door instead. I buy all my clothes on the Internet as well and it works brilliantly, but I have to admit that there are some disadvantages with the Internet too. I don't get as much exercise as I used to get. Nowadays I spend 2 hours in front of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people. I have got friends over the whole world now. I'll go to Japan next month to visit one of my Internet friends. Modern technology opens new and exciting ways for us. I don't think that I would be going to Japan if it wasn't for the Internet. The Internet has opened up a whole new world for me.
I am very glad that all accommodation and travel costs are paid, but still I would like to know how much money  I have to take with me. I would  to travel only in July for family reasons. Another point is accommodation. I would be more than happy if you could provide me with a tent. The reasons are the following: a tent promotes a better relationship with nature, and is a great opportunity to improve my health.
Money is a very important thing for shopping. If you have money, it is not a problem, but if you don't? So, let's imagine that your credit card is not working, or some one stole your cash from your pocket. We will say you're unlucky, but no one will help you in that situation. Also it is very difficult to shop if you are handicapped.
The Manager of the Theatre Dear Sir, I am writing to you so as to express my great disappointment about the Musical Show "Over the Rainbow," which I attended  a fortnight ago. To begin with, never have I been so upset as when I realized that the famous actor I expected, Danny Brook, would not show up at the performance and that he had been shamefully replaced by an unknown actor whose performance was quite mediocre. Your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies; this show did not start at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15. Moreover, I was looking forward to getting a discount on the price of the ticket as indicated in your adverts, but that, once again, fell flat. Indeed, it so happened that this was not the case at all. Additionally, I could not even enjoy having a drink, after the show, in the Theatre Restaurant as it was simply closed for renovation. "A Perfect evening out"!? Not at all. Under these circumstances, as your Theatre did not fulfil its commitments, I ask you for a full refund and I expect to receive a cheque for Â£15, as soon as possible Yours faithfully
A couple of weeks later, my sister called me when I was at work; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears, she could hardly pronounce a word. I didn't say anything and let her go on grieving by herself. After a while, she pulled herself together and paused for a minute. I could then,  upset as ever. I could get her  to simmer for a second or two then she suddenly started shouting uncontrollably: - "Never have I met such a poor cow like Pat", Olga hurled this at me down the phone. Then I woke up; well, I shall never know what happened to the "poor cow"!
I have received the letter you have sent me. I am writing to let you know my answers to the questions you asked me in the letter.
I'm sorry to say that I can attend your camp only in July because I just started my new job and I have one month of  holiday, which is in July.
You wrote to me that I have a chance to do two activities, which I can choose. I'm quite good at painting and I play tennis. I'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints, canvas and brushes for me. The size of the canvas isn't so important.
Could you write to me, because I don't know how much money I need and what type of weather  you have at this time of the year.
Last month we had the pop concert of our favourite Polish group "THE CULT" in Warshaw. I had the chance to help at the concert. You can't imagine how happy I was. I got money for that job and I enjoyed the work a lot. You know I'm good at make-up and I have done scenography many times. They were pleased that I can do two of these jobs, that's why I got the job. I was working like crazy but I enjoyed it a lot. I didn't sleep two nights because I was preparing the stage where they gave the concert.
After that I prepared the group. I did their make-up for them. I was very happy because during this time I had a chance to talk to them and to find out more about them. They are very nice people. Even Audrey who seems very stupid. She is very intelligent. I really don't know why she behaves  so badly during her interview. I got their address so we can visit them one day.
I'm writing to you in order to express my feelings about the International Arts Festival. I spent two days there, and I think it was the best Arts Festival I have ever been to. I also hope that the festival could be even better next year. The great idea of making it "international" was unfortunately not brought to life, because the artists (said to be "from around the world") were from only six countries. Maybe the reason for that is very simple: lack of money? It would explain why some concert halls were simply too small - you just couldn't afford bigger ones.
I am really excited to travel to Camp California in the USA because I like to get to know people from other countries.
As I only have holidays in July I would like to travel in this month.
I arrived in Ireland on 2nd July. On my first day I didn't work. On the next day I helped them to build the scenery and I had enough time to visit a museum in Dublin in the evening. On my third day I helped them to install the sound system. While we were installing the sound system we listened to Irish music and suddenly we saw  U2, which is my favourite group, going inside the stadium and they played music for us.
I am writing in order to express my disappointment with your musical show "Over the Rainbow".
I saw the show's advertisement hanging up on a wall in London where I was spending my holiday with some friends. I convinced them to go there with me because I had heard good reviews of your Company and, above all, because of the main star, Danny Brook.
The problems started at the box office, where we asked for the discounts you announced in the advertisement, and the man who was selling the tickets said that they didn't exist.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Last Wednesday Carole received a letter. The stamp was from a foreign country and the address was written in Capital Letters. She didn't recognize the writing. She began to read, "Dear Carolin.." There was only one person who used to call her by this name. It brought a lot of memories back to her. It was long time ago, when she was fourteen and Paul sixteen. He was her first love and also the first who kissed her. Paul had to move to Mexico because of his father's work. When they were saying goodbye Paul said, "I will be the last person who will kiss you". "It sounds nice but I don't believe it," she replied. "You only have to wait," he said. But she didn't wait. She got married and had two children. At the time Carole was living with her husband but they didn't love each other any more. Their love had finished. In his letter Paul said that he had become a rich man and he would come back to meet her again. Her friend Pat had explained the whole story to her husband. What would she do?
One of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. Our school is now the best in the country in all ages. We are  with this. We can show what we do in order to be the best. If it is possible we can conduct an interview with the last winner.
My wife and I are very keen on theatre, especially with the funny actor "Danny Brook". When we saw your advertisement in the "Evening Post" we made a reservation.
It would be nice of you if you could refund us some money or send us two new tickets.
I was at the show at your theatre three days ago. Unfortunately, my expectations were not realized because of the many problems I had during the show.
First of all, I am a high school student, so I only have four weeks' vacation in July. I would like to travel in July. Secondly, for me, the best way to live in the outdoors is in tents, because that is a good chance to acquire a lot of knowledge about the planets and the animals as well.
In addition, I would prefer to stay in a tent because I would like to stay somewhere which differs from my home and everyday comforts, during these two weeks.
However, in your letter you  mentioned some activities. I would choose Basketball and Tennis. I have been playing basketball in a team in my town for ten years. Also tennis is my favourite hobby and I play twice a week with my friends.
I have just received your letter where you inform me I have won the first prize in the competition and now I'd like to express my opinion about the questions you have written in it.
I know I will have the chance to do two activities, so I have chosen two from your list: basketball, because I have been playing it since I was eight and I have been part of a strong team for three years.
Many people "see"  shopping as an amusement, but I think . In my opinion  shopping is often fun, above all when you can enter a shop without difficulties. For example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because they will create too much confusion, too much noise  wasting time. Shopping is a fun thing to do, not when you are in a hurry, but when you have some free time and when you can relax . Another thing that occurs to me, is that I enjoy myself more when I know I have to go shopping for myself than when it's for my parents or for somebody else!!!
The last problem I would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there. After the show I went to the restaurant according to your advertisement but it was closed for decoration.
From your letter I was pleased to learn that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for. But could you, please, let me have more details about my prize. What kind of people will be invited to your Camp  this summer? I would like to know with whom I'll share such  wonderful days  sports activities.
I would  choose the month of July, because I'm free at this time from family duties.
First of all, in order to  I wrote an invitation to my favourite idol - the poet and  singer Boris Grebenchekoff. We rented for him a special hall near Piccadilly Circus. The hall was crowded. His one-week concert programme was so successful that we decided to invite him , as soon as the tickets were all sold. I had a nice experience as manager too. I would like to be a professional in this area, . Do you share my ambition, Kim? Isn't it a brilliant idea?
I would like to know if it is possible for me to go in July, because I have school in the other months, and it is impossible for me to go in December or January.
Instead of going to the theatre, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at  Ikurapiura park, people prefer spending all their money at shopping centres.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He had talked to Caroline days before the secret was known. She had told him about her relationship with her boyfriend. Everybody knew that Caroline and her boyfriend John loved each other so much that it wouldn't be surprising to find that they had had sex . The point here is that Caroline chose the worst friend to tell this to. She was also concerned about being pregnant, but she was afraid to tell John about it. So she decided to ask Pat what to do. When she finally told him, Pat reacted in a very bad way and told John immediately. He couldn't believe what Pat had told him, so he broke Pat's nose. Pat's father had to pay for a very expensive operation. But like every story this has a happy ending. John and Caroline still love each other, and she wasn't pregnant at all, it was just her imagination. And Pat understood that .
The students in my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we would like to ask you if it is possible to make some changes to the programme.
But at the end of the day it will always be the place to go! We find our family there and our life. Some of us have been living in the same house since we were born. We are sentimental and we have memories from the past. I think it's a part of our life.
I could only travel in the first week of July because I have to join my parents on their trip to Italy, due to start on the 20th.
With regard to the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose from such a huge variety, but I prefer to do those I know better such as climbing. I've been studying Photography on my own, and I am looking forward to practising new techniques and taking pictures of new landscapes.
Most of us would agree on that. Who has never had a bad experience related to an unsatisfactory product? Moreover, who has the freedom to buy whatever they need on an unlimited budget? And finally who has all the time needed to do so?
In the end everything depends on our attitude to life, including shopping. I particularly enjoy making lists of the products  before going shopping. But even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
I have seen your letter about Camp California in the U.S.A and I would like to travel in July because I am pretty busy with my studies and I am working with my dad in his office now.
Jane's grandfather was the organiser of the pop concert and Jane had invited me to help at the event. First I didn't accept but finally she convinced me. It was the most exciting experience I have ever had! I helped with the lights and I was in charge of the food and drink. I did hamburgers and hot dogs and I prepared orange juices.
I would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because I have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness. The two activities I would like to do are basketball and surfing. I have played basketball for 5 years in an amateur team and still play on a playground regularly so my skills are good. On the other hand, I am a complete beginner at surfing. This sport has always attracted me due to its contact with the sea and the great sensations it provides and I believe this is the perfect opportunity to introduce myself to this exciting sport. I still have some questions to ask you:
Shopping seems to be a true pleasure at first: spending money on yourself or people you like is very satisfying and enjoyable, but it can also be a real nightmare.
Then, you can rest a little and examine the product a little closer but, unfortunately, it does not provide the satisfaction you may have wished for. Instead, you keep thinking about the initial product you could not afford, resulting in more frustration and tiredness.
In the first place, I prefer to travel in July because my school will not be closed before this date. Secondly, a camping holiday has always attracted me so I would like to stay in a tent rather than in a log cabin.
In my spare time, I enjoy playing basketball with my friends and I also like swimming. When I was in primary school, I was one of the members of the school swimming team. I am not really good at basketball but I think it is  good fun. For these reasons, I choose basketball and swimming from the list which I was given.
Last month, I had a great time at the concert of "Dragon", which is the most popular hard rock group in the world. They had a concert in my home town, that's why the organisers were looking for young people who could speak English. I applied and they took me on. I worked in the security department. The staff in that department were really friendly and helpful and they were also huge, like giants. Basically, I helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronic equipment that they needed. They treated me as if I was the private secretary of the department, because of this sometimes I felt that the power was in my hands. By the way, I have already been invited to their next concert. They gave me two free tickets. Would you like to come with me?
First of all, the computer. It helps me when I study. I can find many things on the Internet or write my compositions on it.
As you have seen,  modern technology has changed my daily life a lot and I believe that it has changed it for the better.
I have never been to the U.S.A.
The best dates for me to travel would be in July because  I work in the communications industry and I must ask  my employer when I can take holidays. But I think it will be from the 7 July 2000 to the 21 July 2000. Regarding the accommodation at camp, I prefer  the log cabins, because a few years go, I went camping with some friends and every night it rained and in the tent it was impossible to sleep because the ground was so wet.  So for this reason, I choose the log cabins.
Secondly, I appreciated the fact that there were concerts for different kinds of music, but in this case the main problem was that some concert halls were too small, and because of that I couldn't see one of the concerts on the programme.
In my opinion, one of the best things about the last Festival was that there were not only concerts there. I saw films and I played ping-pong. At the next  will there be more or less of that? More I hope. The thing that I liked much more than anything else was that I only had to buy one ticket for all the events, and it was not pricey.
So we can read realistic stories or fantastic ones. It depends on what we prefer.
I always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way, because they give me the opportunity  to escape from  everyday reality. One of my favourite books is without doubt Wuthering Heights, a famous book written by Emily BrontÃ«. The attention of the  is focused on the unfortunate love between Heatcliff and Catherine.
In other words, when I read a book I want to go into a world where I can find something different from my everyday life.
There are some differences between the advertisement and the real show. In the advertisement, you mentioned Mr. Danny Brook and Ms. Tina Truelove were going to perform but actually different people were performing, whom I had never seen before. And also it said it was going to start at 19:30 but it did not start until 20:15. To make it worse, neither discounts nor restaurants were available  that night although they were said to be available. According to the owner of the restaurant, it was closed because .
However, I think there will be some differences in the quality and materials of clothes. For example, speaking of sports, a lot of remarkable progress has been made, especially with swimming costumes and athletes'  for the Olympics.
In conclusion, 100 years from now, I think a better quality of clothes will be  in every . Although the appearance such as shape and colour will not change so much in fashion.
First of all, I would like to express my joy at having won this prize. I am very happy. Secondly, you would like to know when I will be able to go there. Actually, I have asked my boss and he has given me two weeks off in July. We have a lot to do at work so it is not easy to get weeks off. Thirdly, I prefer staying in a tent to staying in a log cabin. I think it is more fun. Concerning the activities, I would choose tennis and sailing. I am very good at tennis. Last year, I took part in a competition and I did  well. I also have a sailing licence but I have not done it for a long time. I need to know what kind of clothes I should take with me. I do not know if things are expensive there. Therefore, could you give me an idea of how much money I should bring with me.
In conclusion, it was not the perfect evening that I expected, so I am therefore writing to ask for a full refund on the tickets. I will be looking forward to hearing from you.
Finally, I decided to visit her but I wanted  it to be a surprise. I worked hard for one month so I could save the money to buy a plane ticket.
I decided to explain all my plans to Pat and she promised me that she wouldn't say anything but it wasn't true. Yesterday she phoned  Alice and explained everything. In spite of this I am very happy because I know that Alice is preparing many activities for us to do together so we have the best week of our lives.
When we arrived at the Circle theatre in the evening, we waited for a long time, because  your advertisement stated that the  show would begin at 19:30, and eventually it began at 20:15.
Moreover, the actors were not the same as the ones in the advertisement. Finally, after the show we went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because they were on holiday. This evening was the worst evening of  my life.
I would like  you to give me back some money for the tickets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She told our parents that we were going to get married in Brazil. Because of this, Sally's parents and my parents went to Brazil posthaste. Sally and I had bought a nice big house beside the sea on the outskirts of the city. It had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one dining room and one kitchen. Indeed, it had a big swimming pool and a beautiful garden. When my parents arrived in Brazil and found us, our dreams were erased. We had to come back to Spain. Because of this, we had to sell the house and left our jobs. When we arrived in Spain, we had to explain to our parents all about our adventure.
That day was the worst day of  my whole life. Now, Sally and I are married, have three children, a marvellous house and both of us are working for a big company.
It is rare that schools  don't have a multimedia centre with many computers for the students to use. But this is good and bad at the same time. Good because you can have access to a lot of information, and it is bad because the computers are doing  people's work. Nowadays we have teachers, and tomorrow? Who has the certain knowledge that  computers will not take the place of  teachers? It is interesting to start to think about this point.
Another point is that  television is taking  childhood away from  children. For example, our parents had time to play with dolls or toys, and the new generation don't have time for this, because they spend a lot of time in front of televisions that only show silly programmes.
In the future we can expect to have a new material and it will make our life more comfortable and convenient. In Japan, crime among minors is increasing. It is said that  one of the reasons is that a small separate room makes children unsociable and depressed.
Thanks for your letter. I am very happy about the news. Also  to know about the all accommodation and travel costs that are included in the first prize.
For example, I live in Kursk, and I can get a letter from my friend some hours after  he has written it. My friend lives in Kresnodar. My grandmother lives in Orel, which is much closer to Kursk than Kresnodar. And it takes 3 days for her letter to get to Kursk. That is because my friend uses e-mail, but my grandmother uses the postal service. So with the Internet I can make friends all over the world and it does not take lots of time.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have a lot of work to do and my parents wish to see me  this month, so if it is possible to arrange the dates that would be very nice.
Third, I love playing basketball. I am a great player and I play for my University and I like to be playing all the time so I will not miss this activity. The other activity would be surfing. I think it is very cool and I want to learn.
She would see if it is pretty or not, if it is on sale at another store, we would not buy the dress and we would have to go to the other store to see the other dress, but after seeing all the stores and looking at all the dresses she would decide on the first one we saw. It would be horrible.
As you know, I've not been keen on pop music - I've always thought it was not only noisy but also even rubbish. It was not until the concert that I became a pop maniac. It was really great to have talked with famous pop singers, bands, and TV stars. When a member of Venga boys came to the emergency center for the treatment of an electric shock to his finger, I felt I was short of breath. We usually are apt to think famous stars to be arrogant and nasty, but they weren't at all. It was absolutely our prejudice. They were very kind, soft, well-behaved, even modest. Their attitudes towards people, their costumes, their songs - everything was really fantastic. Fortunately there were few emergency accidents so I could enjoy the concert without a . I was definitely over the moon!
As if that wasn't enough, after the show, I took the risk of going to your restaurant and it is not very hard to guess that I wasn't able to enjoy it, as  it was closed because it wasn't clean enough to serve food; the perfect ending to the perfect evening.
Considering all this, and especially the fact that I didn't get a discount on my ticket, I think the least you can do is give me my money back to make it up to me, and so I can go and spend the money on a good play where they do what they've promised.
In my own personal experience, technology is something I can't live without. By a simple domestic appliance, a TV or a radio, or a cell phone or a computer, my life is much better now than it was before. For example, whenever I go out by myself, my father gives me a cell phone, to call him in case I need anything. Another thing I depend on is the computer. Not only to play games or use the Internet, but also to write my papers for school.
I've recently been to one of your musical shows called "Over the rainbow" at the Circle theatre in London, thinking it might be a good idea but it was disappointing. I'm writing this letter to explain to you what happened and to look for a solution.
To begin, the organisation of your colleagues in the theatre was awful for various reasons. Despite saying it would start at 19:30, it started at 20:15, which I think is much too late for a good theatre like yours. Also, you say in the advertisement we should visit your restaurant, however, it was closed. How can you explain that?
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so  I knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, Oasis. And she had planned with my friends to go  without me.
At first I got more angry with Pat than with my other friends in the group, because Pat was and is my best friend. However, a couple of minutes later, I calmed down and asked her why. She answered  , "Because all this year you have been so irritable that you got angry with everybody who tried to talk to you," and the other friends had convinced her to dump me.
I asked her to take photos of Oasis for me and she agreed to. If Pat had been good at keeping secrets, I wouldn't have known anything about the concert and I wouldn't have got angry about not being able to go.
On behalf of all the students, I thank you for organizing our trip to London and for the really interesting programme you propose for us as well. It is likely to enrich our vocabulary and our knowledge of  English culture... However, we would like to suggest  something:
We were there at 19:15, as the show was starting at 19:30,  to get our tickets. We asked for the discounts you mentioned in your advertisement but at the counter they told us that they were not available because it was Sunday.
For all these reasons you can understand how unpleasant our evening was. We are asking you to return our money. I hope you'll understand.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. From the time she was a child she couldn't keep anything to herself, she always shared her thoughts with other people.
She was about sixteen years old when she moved to another city with her family. She went to a new school and she had no friends. She was not very sociable and she could not establish relationships very easily. In  time she became close friends with Kim, who was really strange to the other students. Everybody disliked her.
Pat kept this a secret for two months but one day revealed it by accident to a boy in her class. In a few days all the school knew Kim's story. Kim was  because everyone was making fun of her and she was very angry with Pat.
Another problem was with the start of the show. When I finished work I had to rush because the show started at 19:30 and it was 19:00. To my surprise, when I arrived at the theatre the show still had not started. All of us, who had paid a lot of money for those tickets, had to wait a long time before the show started, because it started at 20:15!
When the show was over I went to have dinner in your theatre restaurant but I found it closed because your company is lacking  employees.
I advise you to pay more attention to your shows and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
It all began when, three days ago, I was doing some homework in my classroom. I was alone because Pat had to go to the cinema with her parents. Suddenly, I heard footsteps that were getting closer to me. It was Paul, my teacher, who came to see what I was doing there. After a few words which I didn't pay attention to, my teacher left the classroom. I was bored, so I decided to follow him to discover where he was going. He was going down the stairs wearing his blue jacket. "See you tomorrow!" I cried, but he didn't listen to me. Then, while I was going back to my classroom I saw he hadn't switched off the light in his room. I went to switch it off. As soon as I entered that room I realised he had left our exams there. I couldn't believe my eyes! The exams we had to do the next day were there. Without thinking twice, I took one of them and quickly went home. I had to phone Pat to tell her which questions were in the exam. When I told her the news, she was surprised. We thought we shouldn't tell  anybody else. Next day, in the morning, before the exam, we were going to put the exam back with the other exams.
 I am writing in reply to your letter of the 15th of May. I would like to provide some further information you are asking me for.
I would like a refund because it was one of the worst evenings of my life. If this matter is not resolved,  I will take it further. I hope that it will be resolved properly.
Unfortunately, Pat was not very good at keeping secrets. He and his friends got into trouble because of this habit last week.
As they were watching TV at Nick's house last Sunday, Sally noticed that their cat Curly was hurt, and she could not walk. The children were very unhappy and felt sorry for the pet. "Somebody hurt her and left her without help", Mourk said angrily. "We have to find him and make him pay for his action", Sally told them. Everybody agreed with her.
The show is not as expensive as the Science Museum because  entry to the show is free for students.
You see, the programme only has to be changed on Tuesday morning. In the afternoon we go shopping  how you have organised  your programme. In our opinion it is enough to go one time to a museum and it is on Wednesday .
In the advertisement the time when the show should start was 19.30 but it started at 20:15. When I arrived at the theatre and asked for the discount, it wasn't available. In your advertisement the show was starring Danny Brook, and on the stage a different actor performed and his acting was very poor. The whole show and the acting was of a standard comparable to school theatre. When we decided to visit the theatre Restaurant after the show it was closed because some  decorating wasn't finished. It was this last point that got me angry. After everything that had happened we went to the hotel .
In the last one hundred years science and technology has taken a big step, if we look  back. Similarly, more than 100 years ago  people didn't have the light bulb. They  just used a candle. Nobody  thought about the Telephone, and telegraph. From a small village to the town was a very long way because  people used a horse and wagon.
And I can continue my list in this way... because science never stops in one place.
First it was because of the culture difference. It took quite a long time to adjust to the  in the language institute. Secondly the language ability was another issue. Even if I could meet some friend,  I couldn't express my  to them because we have different backgrounds and our first languages were different.
One day she invited me to her flat. Since then we have visited each other often and spent time together on the weekend usually. We had a fantastic time together for three months. We could even make a trip to Paris in the school holiday! We had many common interests in music, art and books.
About the information you asked me for, the most suitable month for me to travel would be July, since it is when I am free  to travel because I won't have classes at school by that time. As to the matter of accommodation I'd  prefer a log cabin, because I consider them better for resting and getting to know people.
For the attention of the manager: I am writing to complain about the organization of the musical show that the Circle Theatre presented. Firstly, it was said that the stars who were  were Dany Brook and Tina Truelove. However, Dany Brook did not act and was replaced by another actor who was terribly disappointing in his performance. In addition, the show was supposed to start at 19.30 but we could not enjoy the show until 20.15. The advertisement for the show announced that we would be able to visit the Theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because the Chef who runs the Restaurant did not remember to bring the keys to open it. Also, the advertisement said that discounts on the tickets would be available, but they were not. To conclude, I would be grateful if the organization running the theatre gave me my money back. yours sincerely,
Peter had a terrible problem with drugs. He started to consume the stuff at the age of twenty. He had problems at home because his mother wanted to settle down in Australia, but Peter was used to living in New York, where it is overcrowded and he was surrounded by people. Australia is too calm a country for him.
We invited him to  the Texas concert but he started to talk nonsense because of the drugs. Firstly, he began to run around the crowd and also to hit the advertisements which announced the concert. A security guard saw this and turned his attention to him. Pat stared at him and asked for help. The security guard heard her and agreed with Pat that if Peter continued acting in this way he would advise us to leave the concert.
I can only travel in July. As you know, I am a student and the nearest holiday is the summer holiday. But I have booked a flight  home at the beginning of August. And also I would like to go in summer.
1. English lesson. Because  students in the English class are from all over the world, we can talk about everybody's feelings about living and studying in a foreign country.
Concerning the activities, I think that swimming and climbing are the most suitable for me. I have been swimming since I was three and I did a lot of courses. On the other hand I have never taken a course in climbing even though I would like to take up this hobby.
I read your advertisement for the show and I decided to have a wonderful evening by seeing it. I believed in the phrase with which the advertisement ended: 'Your perfect evening out!' But nothing was perfect.
But in the winter there's still a problem   to solve. In the winter you'll freeze. But this problem is solving  itself. The summers and winters get warmer. The reason for this is  global warming, which is the solution for the problem and another reason why this idea is possible.
But in some situations you have to wear something. The clothes you'll wear will be very extraordinary because of their special method of production.
So don't laugh at this idea. Think about this idea and perhaps you'll understand it. It's possible.
I was very disappointed with my supposed "perfect evening out" at your theatre and for all the above-mentioned reasons I am asking for a complete refund on the two attached tickets.
Besides all those improvements and comforts I can't stop thinking where all this will lead us. I am keen on technology because I believe it should improve our lives, however, I dislike the idea that such a science might fall or have already fallen into wicked hands.
I am writing this letter  in order to complain about my unpleasant experience at your theatre. Two days ago, I went to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow" at your theatre. The advertised starting time is 19:30 but for some unknown reason, the play didn't start until 20:15. The audience were anxious and bored.
What made things even worse was that the leading actor Danny Brook did not appear on the stage at all. An understudy took his place. We felt totally disappointed and cheated. After the show, I was hungry and tired. As your poster suggested, I intended to rest for a while at your restaurant. But when I got there, it had closed. In addition, the ticket office didn't offer me any discounts, as you had advertised on the poster, when I bought the ticket.
Modern technology has changed my daily life in two ways. First with a lot of advanced techniques being put to practical use, our living conditions are becoming more and more convenient and comfortable. When we look around  the house, it is easy to find things like  a microwave oven, TV set, computer etc. All these items of equipment are  applications of modern science. When you are planning to travel, you can choose a train, car or even a plane as your means of transportation. Without the development of modern technology, it may take you several years to reach your destination.
Second, modern technology makes communication much easier and more enjoyable. With the spreading use of the Internet, people living in different parts of the world can chat with each other via the web. And we can also share important information with other people. The development of information technology has changed the world into "a global village".
Modern technology plays an important role in our lives. I am hoping to devote myself to its development.
The truth about Shopping
Shopping... a great and emotional statement, don't you think? Everyone thinks that shopping is the best way to get rid of your problems and, in fact a big solution to many problems or , boring, or only for distraction.
This summer, I am available in July because in August my family and I are going to go to Canada and in September I will go back to university. If there is no chance to go to California in July, I could wait until next summer.
It was brilliant! I had the best month of my life. It was a hard month because my job was very hard. I worked 12 hours per day but always with fun people. My job was cleaning the floor after the concert; "it was very dirty". It wasn't a nice job but I had all night for drinking and dancing of course. I didn't have to pay  to get in.
Helping at the pop concert has been a great experience because I've met  new friends and I know that at the concert there aren't any drunks just fun, wonderful people.
I am looking forward to next summer because I'd like to go to Spain to help with "Doctor Meesee", which is the best concert in the world. I hope you will come there. You have to save up some money because Spain is too expensive (beach, beer, discos..).
So, as you can see, modern technology has had an influence on my life.
First of all, I'd like to thank you for the prize I won. I'd like to get to know the USA. This prize came at a good time.
I'd like to travel in July because I've got an examination at USP in Roo Cohelo in July. For this the only month that I can travel is July. And I'd like to stay in a log cabin because I can't bear sleeping in a tent. I hate that kind of accommodation. But I love sports. I'd like to play tennis and go swimming.  These are my favourite sports. I can play tennis better you I can swim, because since I was a child I've been playing it. I've already won three prizes in it.
We had a class discussion about shopping, because of it I'm writing to explain about my opinion.
I have recently received your letter saying that I have won the first prize in the competition. It was very fortunate for me.
I think that shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropriate time! Not only are shops crowded with people, the changing rooms have enormous queues. The clothes are quite expensive and they are never your size. These things can be very annoying but there is a good side to 'shopping'.
In answer to your question, I will have to say that I can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only gave me that month off.
We have all been shopping once in our lives and sometimes it probably has not been very enjoyable, why? We had a class discussion and we all agree on some points.
Sometimes we have to take our little brothers with us, because our mother isn't home, and that is when the problems begin. Most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... And when this happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
During my stay in London I went to your Circle Theatre to see the musical 'Over the rainbow'. In the advertisement you promised a perfect evening out, but it wasn't. So with this letter I want to ask for some money back. Now I want to explain about the problems. It was very disappointing for me that the actor wasn't Danny Brook, as was promised in the advertisement. It also said that the evening shows started at 19.30, but it started 20.15. I had to buy a Â£20 ticket because discounts were not available. After the show I wanted to go to the theatre restaurant with my friends, but it was closed because of  illness. So I want to ask for my money back, also  I had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisement. I hope you will answer my letter and solve the problems at your theatre.
I recently visited your theatre to see the musical show "over the rainbow". I was very disappointed because the actors weren't Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. Instead of them you had different actors. Then the show was delayed, it started at 20:15, not at 19.30. I had to wait 45 minutes! Another thing is that the discounts weren't available although I had read about them earlier in your advert.
After the show was finished, I decided to drink something, but when I arrived at the restaurant it had been closed. But in your advertisement you wrote that people can visit the restaurant after the show. I can't understand this kind of mistake.
Modern technology has changed my daily life in the sense that everything I do is becoming easier. For example when I have to write a letter or do my homework, I always write it on the computer. If I search for something like a telephone number or an address I also look it up on the Internet. I also use the Internet when I need any information, for example if I need some information for school or privately, for myself. A few years ago I had to go to a library and look things up in many books. That took a long time.
Modern technology, such as computers, cars and other things, have changed my life in many different ways such as communication, travelling and working. For example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense that I don't need my dad or my mum to go  ice-skating or to go to work. I can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of  technology, but because I can show that I am responsible. With this car I can see the world, not exactly, but I can travel and visit other countries than Switzerland.
Another piece of technology that changed my life is the computer because you can do many things with it, like homework, work, photos, but the most important in my eyes is  communication with my friends from different parts of the world via the web. This is a big step for  technology and I can say that it is the most important for me because I like to have a lot of friends. So I spend almost one hour every day on the web. Finally the piece of technology that I would like to emphasise is the TV. This is a good one because you can see what is happening around you and everywhere else on Earth. Naturally technology is everywhere even in the kitchen, for example a special plate or something else, and I could talk a lot about them, but I think that the one thing here something is the most important in  changing  my daily life . 
I would like to know if it is possible to travel to this camp in July because for me it is the best time and I cannot travel before or after , according to my employer. During these two weeks I would like to stay in a tent because you can be nearer to  nature than you are in a log cabin. I like to go camping. From the activities, I choose basketball and golf. I am very good at basketball, because I have played in a basketball team for ten years. But at golf I am a beginner.
I think one alternative is to buy your things on the Internet, because then you don't have to invest a lot of time  buying all these things, and they bring you the things to your home. In the end I think it is  best if you have the chance to shop when there are not so many people because then you have enough time and you are not stressed.
Imagine you have three children and you are going shopping with them. I can tell you how bad a situation you are in because when I was a child I always had  arguments with my mother about shopping. I can remember how upset I was if my mother didn't buy what I wanted and how much I cried. It was very shameful for my mum. She was also very angry because she never managed to get me out of the toy shop.
If you are used to reading a lot, you know there are only a few books about which you can say: 'This is such a marvellous book I will want to read it again'. "Cry Freedom", by John Briley, is one of these books. But why should we read this book twice?
However, I think that the main reason why someone has to read this book twice is the strength and depth of the two main characters: Donald Woods and Steve Biko. Both of them symbolize courage, the love of justice, the fight for freedom, which makes them look like heroes. Just like the Greeks and the Romans, our modern society has legends, and "Cry Freedom" is one of them.
First of all, I would like to say something about the star: I went to the theatre because I wanted to see Danny Brook, but once there I found an actor who I had never heard of. So the main purpose of my visit had failed.
Another point is the time when it started, exactly 45 minutes late. A serious theatre can't fail on such an important thing, the time of the performance. I had to wait all that time in the street, because the hall was not big enough. Moreover, once I was  paying for the tickets, I found another thing out: there were no discounts available. In your advertisement you informed us of their false existence.
An example could be the Internet. It changed my life, because with it I can find more information than I can in a newspaper, and also information from all around the world, which I could never possibly access without the Internet. But, it is not only news or information. You can communicate with people in places where you would never  imagine going to because it would be too expensive. An example could be the popular chat rooms, where people write with the keyboard what they want to tell. But, if you don't like using the keyboard to say something or to communicate, you can use video conferencing, a system which lets you  talk with other people simply with a microphone and speakers. Also there is the potential to download things to your PC like software, pictures and, also, music. The modern technologies mean I am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if I buy a , I can carry this music  everywhere.
Also computers and mobile phones have evolved thanks to modern technologies. Without this evolution, we would probably still be in  ancient times. Who wants to return to  ancient times? No electricity, no canalized water, no healthy water, no TVs, no phones, no PCs.. I'm afraid that the people in  ancient times lived although they didn't have any of these things, but me and everyone in these times, I'm afraid that we wouldn't like to return to this life. Also, I think that modern technologies are necessary, but also I think that they are  expensive, but with time, the price goes down. So, if the price goes down it  is because something new is at available to sell. It is like a  circle.
Furthermore, some students would like to film the school football team, because football is the most  activity among the students.
However, something wrong occurred again. The actor 'Danny brook', whom you advertised in the brochure, did not play a part in the show. And I was really disappointed with the different actor's performance. He kept forgetting his lines. Finally, I went to the restaurant to have something for dinner after the show, but it was closed because it was being refurbished . I am not satisfied with your show as it was completely different from the advertisement.
In fact, unlike the perfect evening out that you promised in your advertisement, I had a very disappointing evening.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. So the surprise we prepared for  Leon's birthday had failed. However, we'd started to plan  for it  one month before. To start with, I wanted to bring him to my house where everybody would wait for him. But he wanted to stay at  home. So Sigone thought of the greatest idea. We would pretend to have bought a dog for him. Leon hates dogs, and I don't know why. So we had to find a dog that Leon wouldn't recognise. And I found one. I had a friend who had just got a little dog. But he was  Pat's friend too, and Pat explained everything to Leon. No luck.
Regarding Camp California in the U.S.A., I expect to travel in July because I will have a long holiday at that time and my children have to go to France with  school in July as well. I think it will be a very good time to travel  without worries.
Today I am going to write about the experience of helping at a pop concert  I went to last month. I have got a lot of things to talk about.
By the way, I did a lot of things at that concert. I had to  people who were responsible for  ticket. They had to check when people came in the hall and I was  checking the tickets as well. You know, you have to  when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they  try to go through very quickly. So you have to explain  a lot of times to make people calm down and stand in a row. It was very hard for me and I won't do it again.
First of all, a big problem is the children. When they go  shopping with their mothers, they want to buy all the things that they see: doors, little cars, films... but, when their mothers see a good thing that they want to buy, then the children are crying because they are tired from shopping all  day.
I am a student at Portsmouth College and the end of this term is 23 June, so I can only travel in July. I wonder if it is all right to come at that time. And concerning my accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable. I would like to relax there and enjoy the atmosphere in which I will be living .
What's more, the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished, because the show started at 20:15. It should have started at 19:30 as you said in your advertisement, and you should not have closed it before the show finished.
Thank you for your informative letter and your congratulations. I was really delighted to hear about my success in your competition and me winning the prize. I'm really looking forward to it as I've never been to the U.S.A. before.
Regarding the best dates for my visit, I wonder if it would be possible to come in July because I'm going to sit a very important exam at the end of June. Two weeks in the USA would be a great opportunity for me to relax after that.
You asked me to choose my accommodation from either tents or cabins. I prefer sleeping in a log cabin (I had a very bad experience with tents while I was camping with friends last year)
After having looked around the shops for 10 hours and tried at least 2,000 shoes, I finally found what I was looking for - the shoes of my dreams (well designed and not too expensive). So I went back to the station, very proud of myself with my sneakers in a white plastic bag and a great smile on my face.
I stayed  happy during the journey, thinking of how cool I would look in the playground with my brand-new shoes on.
As I jumped off the train, I met a friend of mine. I immediately wanted to show him what I had bought to make him jealous. I took the white plastic bag and... Oh my god! There was no more plastic bag.  I had left it on the train!
How stupid I am! It seems like I will have to play in old shoes for one more summer...
As you know, I helped at a pop concert last month. I did things as unusual for me as cleaning instruments, organising people, and also looking after the artists' clothes. In fact everything was very easy, the instruments were already clean, and with the clothes my job was only to wait there and give them what they asked for. Organising people involved just a couple of things, telling people how to do the same as me and when.
The most exciting things were to be able to speak to the singers, the whole environment, and of course to  listen to the Concert from the very first row.
Regarding the activities, I would like to do some painting, which I am quite good at. The second activity I chose is sailing. I have been on a sailing ship two times without doing anything, therefore I have got no experience at all.
However, this apparently quiet and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people. Nevertheless the worst will come when you lose the youngest member of your family and you have to spend the whole day looking for him/her.
I am writing to you about your questions. First, I can come there only in July because of my examination, I have to take it in June, and my new term will also start in September. I would like to stay in log cabins because I have stayed in tents many times in my childhood. The most exciting offer is your activities. I have been interested in Painting but I have not had a chance, so I would like to do it, and I would like to do climbing. My grandfather used to do it when he was a student. After he got a job, he became busy. However, he retired from his job last year so he has had his own time. If I know how to climb, I will enjoy it with my grandfather.
I would prefer to travel only in July because it's when my vacations start. I could even think about skipping school. July is also good because the weather is warm and I could enjoy the time I will spend in the camp more. I would prefer a tent because I'll be in touch with  nature and I could listen to the sounds of the night. The two activities that I've chosen are Climbing and Photography. I've already climbed for four months on walls, indoor climbing. I think I can handle it very well. I've chosen Photography because I love to take pictures! I've never taken any classes or training but I think I can take very good pictures. I would like to learn more about developing films.
. if I have to take any special equipment for the activities that I've chosen
Dear Manager: I am Angela Ounis and I am writing to you because I went to see 'Over the Rainbow', London's newest and best musical show. I am very disappointed by this evening's show. First of all, the stars that were supposed to be there (Danny Brook and Tina Truelove) weren't there. I was so enthusiastic about your stars, when I realized they had been replaced, even though the replacements were good, it wasn't the same. I arrived there at 19:15. The show was supposed to start at 19.30, but started at 20:15. It cannot be possible that a schedule for a show can be changed that much. You go there to see a show and have a good time, not to wait for ever for what you want. Also it was said that Discounts would be available, but I didn't receive any discount as you were cheating us. I know that you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people, stick to it. Also, the theatre Restaurant was closed because they've got a problem with the . That was so unpleasant, people were starving. I am so disappointed with this that I am within my rights to ask for some money back, your theatre show wasn't what was expected. Please let me know . sincerely yours
I arrived there on time, 19:15, in fact you wrote that the show would be starting at 19:30, but I had to wait until 20.15. What an absurd thing, don't you think so? The quality of the show wasn't as high as I expected. I hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should have been a luxury restaurant where I could eat. But it was closed because it was under construction.
First of all, we would like to say  thank you very much for organising our tour around London and our programme, which is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit.
We think that it could be a great opportunity because in one day we can see everything concerning fashionable clothes, new make-up and hairstyles. Furthermore it is free for students.
Secondly, I would prefer to sleep in a tent. I go camping every year in the countryside of France. The activities that I have chosen are sailing and climbing. I have never sailed but I am a good swimmer. Last summer I took a climbing course for one week in Switzerland so I know a lot about this sport.
A lot of people like shopping and everybody goes on Saturday because  lots of people  don't go to work then and it is the only day off for the majority of people. If you don't get up early enough you can't find a parking space in the town centre.  All of them are full by 11 am. The street is so crowded that you can't walk like you usually do and if you go with some friends you can be sure that you will lose them.
Why not shop over the Internet or if you have a nice mother at home  because shopping is like going into the jungle.
The reason for my letter is that our class would like to suggest a few changes to our programme for London, because we have seen an advertisement about an interesting activity that we could include in our programme.
First of all, we want to say thanks to you because we know the effort you have made organising this excellent programme, but we would really like to go to the London fashion and leisure show we saw in the advertisement. We think that perhaps on Tuesday March 14 we could change the time when we go to the Science Museum, and  go to the Museum earlier, perhaps at half past eight in the morning, so we could go later, at ten o'clock, to the show, and we could also delay going shopping on that afternoon, because the show lasts till seven o'clock in the evening. And we thought that we could go shopping the next day, because we do not have anything to do on that afternoon.
In the future, our homes will incorporate the most advanced technologies. Computers will play an important part in our daily life, so that we won't go shopping, because via the computer we will be able to buy whatever we want. Books will gradually disappear, and instead we will read all the things we want on our computer. We won't have any need  to leave  home, because the computer will give us everything.
In conclusion, in the future home our living conditions will improve, and the computer will be very important for us, but it won't control us, because we still have the most important thing in a home . That will be the same as now.
I received your letter, which says I won the first prize in your competition - two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. I appreciate that and I thank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner. I accept  and I want to inform you that I can travel only in July because I have booked my annual leave for that period. Also, I prefer to stay in tents because I have memories from my childhood. Every year my parents used to send me  to Camps in the mountains so I would like to stay for a while in the same type of accommodation and environment. Also, I prefer swimming and painting. I started to learn how to swim when I was 7 years old. My parents took me to the seaside every weekend so I got used to being in the water all  seasons. I have taken part in races twice in my life, where I was successful. Also, I have liked painting from an early age, and I have taken part in a public exhibition, where I won  first prize. I would like to ask how much money I should have with me and where can I keep it? What about the clothes? You don't mention anything about them. Do I need something special or can I wear ordinary clothes?
I am a member of the council team so I decided to help them at a pop concert that was organized  last month. I helped them to prepare the room for the bands and I decorated the place for the singers. Also, I helped them to choose the right instruments and to test them. It took a long time to test the speakers and the microphones. Apart from this preparation, I also helped out during the concert. I helped them to  the music and  the songs. It was quite a difficult job but I got some very good experience. I realised it when the concert had finished. The audience was excited and I cannot describe my happiness. It was something that I didn't expect. Also, it was the first time in my life. I still have the sound of the music in my ears and the voices of the young people who were accompanying our songs. I enjoyed it very much and I want to convey my pleasure to you through this letter.
I am writing to you to give you some required information. First of all, I am glad to hear that I won the first prize in your competition. I am happy to visit the United States with your organisation.
Actually, I would like to go to Camp California next July because I have got two weeks' holiday then. I also will be pleased to stay in a log cabin. My experience of camping is not so huge as to encourage me to stay in a tent for 2 weeks.
I was a little bit disappointed with their attitude. They didn't really appreciate the service. Some of them were quite rude. Apart from that, it was an amazing experience.  If you ever have the opportunity to do something like this then do it without hesitating. I liked seeing their way of life.
Secondly, about the time. If it's delayed you should have told us before. Not waiting there for almost 1 hour doing nothing. Due to the late start, it finished at 1 AM and my taxi which I booked just left so I had to wait outside for another hour to get a taxi. It was freezing outside and I got a horrible cold because of that.
But what about 100 years later? I expect human beings will live on  other planets and travel around under the sea.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE TERRIBLE NIGHT I HAD IN YOUR THEATRE.
FIRSTLY I WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT YOU WROTE IN THE BROCHURE. IT WAS COMPLETELY WRONG!
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WAS NOT VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS. THIS WAS LIKE AN ILLNESS FOR HIM. SO MANY TIMES HE WAS TOLD: "PAT, I WILL TELL THIS SECRET ONLY TO YOU". PAT COULD STAND THIS SECRET ONLY A FEW DAYS, AFTER WHICH THE SECRET CAME FROM  DEEP INSIDE, AND HAD TO BE SAID. THIS WAS TERRIBLE FOR HIS FRIENDSHIPS: HE ALWAYS LOST HIS FRIENDS. HE WANTED TO DIE BECAUSE OF THIS. THE WORST THING WAS THAT HE COULD NOT IMPROVE THIS BEHAVIOUR. ONE DAY  FORTUNE HELPED OUR POOR PAT. ON THE BUS HE SAW A THIEF WHILE HE WAS STEALING A WALLET, HE WANTED TO SCREAM, BUT HE WAS ASTONISHED. WHEN THE ROBBER REALISED HE COULD BE DISCOVERED AND HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T KEEP THIS SECRET I WILL KILL YOU". PAT, AS HE ALWAYS DID, COULDN'T KEEP THE SECRET, EVEN IF HE WAS SCARED. EVENTUALLY THE ROBBER WAS CAUGHT BY THE POLICE, AND FOR HIS BRAVERY AND HONESTY HE HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS.
Dear sir, I'm writing to express my displeasure about the organization of the musical show I went to last Saturday evening. According to your advertisement, Danny Brook should have been there, starring in all the scenes. Instead, you changed the actor without any warning, so I didn't see my favourite Danny Brook, which was a  total disappointment, as his substitute couldn't match him at all. And what about the starting time? I had to wait for about an hour, as the show started at 20.15 instead of 19.30. Another thing that made me angry was that I couldn't get a discount. I was very annoyed about it: I only expected the discounts you had promised in the advertisement and, as I am a university student, I should have a right to one. On top of everything, your theatre restaurant was closed because it was being repaired, so I couldn't have my dinner either! It was a terrible evening out, so I ask you for a refund for all the trouble you caused me. Yours sincerely,
Most people think modern technologies aren't as positive as they are often presented to be.
Then, surfing on the Internet is becoming my passion: it's incredible how many unthinkable activities you can do with it. It's simply fantastic!
In your advertisement, you had written that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would be performing. However, I noticed when I was watching it that a different actor was performing. I had expected Danny Brook to perform and it was extremely disappointing.
Also, the times printed in your advertisement were 14.30 and 19:30. I went to the 19:30 show, but it did not start until it was 20:15. I had my evening planned out and I was not pleased that the show started forty-five minutes late.
In your advertisement, it said that discounts were available for the tickets. However, when I was there to buy a ticket, there were no discounts available.
However, the person who helped me through this hard time was, surprisingly, Pat. She showed up on my doorstep just when I was having one of my worst days. She told me she had heard about my parents' divorce and wanted to help. When she was comforting me I noticed she had changed. She was a person I could turn to, I could trust. She let me pour out my feelings, a thing I did not do with anyone. Ever since, she has had my trust and I have told her my feelings and secrets. Unlike a year ago she did not tell a soul. She kept every single one of my secrets well, and, not surprisingly, she became my best friend. Eventually, I got over my parents' divorce and lived like a normal, happy teenager.
Almost everyone hates other people gossiping about their private lives. It's a natural reaction to be angry with somebody you don't trust for gossiping about you and . So I think famous people, no matter if they are politicians or film stars, don't deserve to be followed by journalists every time they are trying to have a good time.
I saw your advertisement for your show at the circle theatre, over the rainbow. I went to it, but I was really disappointed about something.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, and she went to her house to talk about the things I had told her. First she said to her father, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that I was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometres  from Earth and then I was so ashamed because I have been her boyfriend since I came to Earth.
I'm writing to you because I went to the International Arts Festival and it was a pleasure. Let me introduce myself: I'm Mary, I'm nineteen and I'm studying arts. Also, I want you to know my opinion and I'd like to give you my suggestions, because it would be useful for you for the next festival.
Firstly, I want to congratulate you on the idea. I think that the development of the arts is very important and that everybody could attend without paying too much. Having one ticket for all the events is a great method because it's  way of paying and you save time.
In the letter you ask when I would like to go. The most suitable month is July, because my pen friend is going to visit me in June. Also I  because I have just finished my military service and I got used to staying on the camp.
There are two activities. I am good at Basketball and tennis. I played Basketball at  university. At  university I attended tennis lessons for two years. Finally I would like to ask you if I need to bring money and clothes with me.
I am looking forward to hearing the news about your group. I wish you all the best!
Firstly, I have to say that I am studying at University and I wonder if I could travel in July because of the exams I have in May. Also I would not be able to travel there until the end of June.
Everything was all right during the band's performance, but at the end some spectators came up on the stage and did some damage to the band's instruments. The singer and the guitarist were so angry that they left immediately, leaving the public without the last part of the show.
As you can see, hardly anything went well, but the lights and the sound - for both of which I helped carry things - were appropriate for the concert. Despite all these things, I gained a lot of experience and I could be near one of my favourite pop stars, which was the best experience I've ever had.
Firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. I believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
Fourthly, I have to admit that a big advantage was your idea of giving one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events. That was excellent because it attracted people's attention.
I would like to travel in July because I am going to finish  college at the end of June and I will work from the first of August.
regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin. I think that will be safer for all my things.
I'm very keen to have the chance to take part in some activities. I'm very interested in the golf. I will be a beginner because I've never done this sport before but I will have a try. Also, I choose surfing. I love this sport. I've been doing this sport for 5 years, so I'm quite good.
Thank you for your last letter. I really envy you your holiday in the sun.
I have  very good memories of this experience. I think I will go back  next year.
Third point, your advertisement told us about a "discount available" on the price of the ticket but there wasn't one.
Well, as you see, it wasn't a "perfect evening out!" and I think that you could give  me some money back because I really have the impression that your advertisement is wrong. I'm waiting for your reply,
This little essay shows that I depend on technology and, moreover, because I'm in an electronic engineering school, I'm keen on technology.
I am writing to thank you for the good programme, especially for Wednesday, because the other students and I like art galleries.
We stayed at my aunt's house which was in the centre of the village. In front of my aunt's house, there was a house with a swimming pool, garage and garden. My aunt told me it was a famous French singer's house.
Firstly, when I wanted to buy a ticket, I was informed that no discounts were available. However, the serious problems appeared later. The play not only started 45 minutes after it was planned, but when the actors eventually appeared on the stage, I also saw that Danny Brook had been replaced by a different actor, who was very disappointing in his role. To make matters even worse, the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, without any information being given about the reason for its closure.
Have you ever thought of the year 2100? Do you think that the world will be different from the present-day world then? I would answer "yes" to both questions. And if I were asked, "What will be completely different in the year 2100," I would say: clothes.
Secondly, the plays and films were very well organized despite  the low numbers. I suggest you organise a couple more next year. The art exhibition and the talks by writers were great. The art exhibition showed us a new lifestyle and society that was totally different from ours. The talks by writers were very technical but they could be understood by all the people who were at the festival.
In conclusion, I was impressed by all the good organisation, the service and the cost of the weekend ticket for all events. The price was excellent because there wasn't any time limit.
At home I'm allowed to do what I want if I'm respectful of my parents' timetable. I can go out at night once a week if I tell them where I'm going to be. If I lie to them or don't explain the plans that my friends and I have I won't be able to go out, and will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when they aren't at home.
I can only travel in July, because the Hospital I work for has allowed me to take my holidays in that month. I don't mind if I travel during the first fortnight or during the second one, although I would prefer travelling during the second fortnight, if it is possible.
We arrived at the stadium the evening before. The team of volunteers was a great one, and all of us were willing to help with anything they needed done. Firstly, we were asked to clean the stadium, especially the seats and surroundings. When we finished cleaning, some of us offered  to help to bring the sound equipment into the stadium. They said that it wasn't necessary and we sat down on the grass and observed how the stage was being prepared for the concert.
And then, when everything was ready, Celine appeared on the stage to do a sound check. I was astonished. It was incredible! I was so near her! When she finished the sound check, I went to meet her. I told her I was very happy  to be there and to have helped at the concert, and I asked her for an autograph. She gave it to me with a great smile and gave permission to take a photograph of both of us. And she dedicated the photograph to me!
I am from Brazil and I recently had a holiday in London. During my stay I read an advertisement for a musical show being put on at The Circle Theatre. As I was reading the advertisement I got very excited, because I am a great fan of Danny Brook, and he was going to be performing in the musical. When I got to the theatre I asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but they were not available. Anyway, I decided to buy my ticket, since I thought the play was going to be good. So I sat in my chair and waited for 45 minutes until the show started, which is an unacceptable delay.
I guess science is about solving our daily problems with technological advances. That is exactly what has happened to me. When I was younger, I remember that when I had to study or to work on a school project I would take a lot of time researching in libraries, looking for old books. Today I can connect to the Internet and find all the information I need faster than you can imagine.
All the students in my class are excited about one more thing. We saw an advertisement for the Fashion And Leisure Show. It will be at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is Tuesday March 14. The show is open 10.00 - 19.00. This show is about the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. One more thing about the show is that it's free for students. Isn't it a great opportunity for us?
All people have some difficulties with their jobs but some  have more than  others. The reason for this is that they are famous and everybody wants to know about them.
Moreover, the advertisement for the show says that the main role in the musical is played by the great Danny Brook. I must admit I'd been looking forward to seeing him. In fact on the stage appeared a completely different person.
School finished and we, I mean Pat, Tim and me, didn't know what to do with so much spare time. I didn't want to spend that holiday with my parents in the country. I was old enough to go somewhere only with my friends. Tim made a suggestion about going to the seaside in his new car. It seemed fantastic but we knew our parents would never agree. We had to find another way out. We planned to tell them that we were going to a summer camp in the mountains where we would practise French. Our parents were very pleased and happy we were so ambitious. Of course, we didn't want to go there, it was just a "cover". We prepared tents and other relevant equipment and we waited. We promised to keep it  secret.
I am writing to you because, as one of the visitors of the International Arts Festival which took place two weeks ago in our city, I would like to let you know some of my opinions - and suggestions, as well - related to what I saw at the festival and what I could not see, but I would have liked to find.
First of all, I must congratulate the people responsible for this good idea. We all know that our city lacks art festivals and cultural activities in general. And what  better way to solve this than to give the festival an international character.
Secondly, there were some accommodation problems in the classical concerts because some concert halls were too small. Another important thing is that, despite the number and quality of films, there were, from my point of view, not many plays. In addition, I would like to talk about the success of the weekend ticket with most visitors, due to its economical price and because of its ease of use.
Finally, I would like to suggest that, in next year's festival, you include different kinds of music, like ska or world music.
One possible thing is to display what you can do best in a public place, and, then, "sell" it to the people. For example, you can do a folk dance, do Hamlet in the street, or even sing a nice song from your country with some of your friends. You must be aware, however, of the difficulties with these kinds of things (bad weather, no attention from the people and so on).
Thank you for your letter informing me about the prize I had won.
I would like to answer  your questions. Please note that I can travel only in July because only then can I take holidays from my work, after the busy time in the months of May and June.
I am looking forward to this holiday.
I would like to tell you about my experience at the last pop concert. It was very nice for me to help because I saw so many people and I got a lot of experience of things that I had never done before.
Hoping to hear of your decision soon.
On the one hand, it is true because famous people have to do their jobs, that means being interviewed, giving news to the public, and so on. Moreover, especially with film stars, lots of people are hoping to see them on the TV or in the newspapers, and this is really good for their careers.
I am writing to tell you that my class is interested in going to the show which takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March.
We have seen it in an advertisement and I would like to go to the show. I would also like to tell you that it is a very interesting event because it includes all the latest fashions in leisure and sports wear and make-up as well as hairstyles. It is a great opportunity for us because the  is fascinating and free.
I would be very grateful if you could change the programme so as to allow us to go to the show. For example, we would be able to put off our visit to the science museums on Tuesday morning till Wednesday afternoon. The fashion show starts at 10 o'clock and finishes at 7 o'clock.
Journalists follow  famous people, such as politicians and film stars, in order to take photos and get  information about them. After that the journalists sell their information to the newspapers and magazines in order to earn money.
I am writing to complain about the Musical  'Over the Rainbow', performed at the Circle theatre last week.
However, there are a lot of negative aspects to the way that technology affects my life. As technology develops so fast, there are always new things to buy, and it also reduces the amount of jobs available, so it is getting hard to find a job.
Secondly, I would be grateful if you could arrange accommodation for me in log cabins as I am not used to staying in the countryside and especially not in tents.
I would also be grateful if you could send me information about the average cost of living in California, as I have to work out the amount of money that I am going to spend, and some advice about the clothes that I need. I would also like you to specify if the food is included in the prize.
Furthermore, I think it will be a good idea to  on the football pitch as it is completely new and fully equipped.
In conclusion, I have to declare that  I and my fellow students will be available to help with this short video .
I would like to travel in July; that is for me the only possibility because I will finish my course at university at the end of June and I will start to work in September.
Since this stay at Camp California is a good opportunity to try out new activities, I would like to sail and climb, but I am a beginner at both activities.
I'm writing concerning your letter about my winning two weeks at Camp California in your competition. I'm very happy to be the winner of your competition.
Because I'm working in an accountant's office, I'm very busy. The only month I could go on holiday is July, when we haven't got a lot to do.
Moreover, concerning the accommodation, I would like to be in a tent, because I want to spend my holidays . And in my opinion, when you sleep in a tent, you .
I like a lot on your list of  sports possibilities. However, I will choose swimming. I was a member of a swimming club for about 10 years. Additionally I'm keen on taking pictures. But so far I have only taken pictures on holiday and of some family celebrations.
I am a student in the English class. All my classmates are looking forward to going to London. Thank you so much for organising such a great programme.
Have you stayed in a park during the night?
I was sitting under a full-bloomed cherry blossom tree. Inside the dark, I was alone and only the moonlight helped me to see  things. I was regretting  having risked staying in the park alone.
Modern technology has changed our daily life a lot. We use mobile phones so it doesn't matter if we are in a crowded city or in a desert. You can communicate with other people any time you want. Nearly 90 per cent of people know how to use a computer and computers are used in every area of our lives. We also have the Internet, with which you can learn something about the world in less than a minute.
Modern technology is very important for all the countries. It has a very big role in developing a country. When you look around, you can easily understand that modern technology is used for everything.
I have no doubt that you will succeed with next year's festival.
The best advantage of this job is the pay. It is very good considering how little time we spend on it. It's about 3,000 yen per hour in my district. It is also attractive that this job rarely affects our university studies. Students who want home tutors are usually primary school, junior high school, or senior high school students, and that means they take lessons after school, not in the daytime. So, in the daytime, we can focus on our studies.
I would like first, on behalf of my whole class, to thank you for all you've done for us and for our trip to London.
We've just been told about your programme and I must say that we all like it! What I am most looking forward to is the River trip to Greenwich; but I would also really like to visit the Science Museum as well as the National Gallery! This will be very enriching for us! You must wonder why I'm writing to you, then! ... Well actually we've just received an  for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and the vast majority of the class would like to go and see it. This will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday 14th March. We thought it would be a great experience for us since we  don't have such opportunities in our everyday life! Moreover,  admission is free for the students so that won't raise the cost of the trip. I thought we should visit the Science Museum on Monday afternoon so that we could do the River trip on Tuesday morning just before going to the fashion show! Anyway, we were going shopping on Tuesday afternoon so that won't be a problem to my mind!
I am writing to you because I have some suggestions for next year's festival, and if it is possible I would like to give you some opinions about this year's festival.
The last thing is that I was very surprised when I read that you have a weekend . This is an excellent idea because during the week people don't have too much time to go to the festival. Now they can visit it with the whole family at the weekend and see all events for a reasonable price.
Thank you for your letter, and I'm sorry I haven't written. I have had examinations, but now I have plenty of time and I can write a letter to you. In your letter you ask me about the rules I have at school and home. I think that they are the same as yours, but I'm not 100 per cent sure so I am writing this letter:
The rules at school are: we must be on time for lessons, and we must always do our homework. Everybody must be present at lessons. If someone is ill, they must bring a note from a doctor. And the main rule is that everyone must be nice to the teachers. At home I must clean my room and vacuum the home. I often go shopping and help my mother clean windows. I like cleaning my home, and I like it when it is clean and fresh. However I'm the only child and I don't have to do too much but I want to and I like it. There is one thing I would like to change, and that is the treatment students receive from teachers. They want too much fromstudents and are unkind to them.
Regarding the activities, I would love to play basketball. I'm used to playing it, and I'm quite a good player. The other activities don't appeal to me much, but I'm quite good at golf. I like surfing and playing tennis, and sports such as sailing and climbing. Please, don't make me sing or paint, because I'm not very keen on it.
During the afternoon, Tim and I spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held.
I would very much enjoy playing tennis because it is a sport I love and I am really good at it. In addition I would love to attend the photography classes even though I have never tried to take a picture before.
Finally, if I have any chance to choose activities, I will choose basketball and Sailing with no doubt because I would love to make friends through these kinds of sports. Both could be exciting for me.
I would like to know more about clothes and money. I have got no idea about them. I would be grateful if you could send me some information about them.
Last month, I helped at a pop concert by chance. I have just worked as a normal worker but I have met so many famous singers who I always see on TV. Of course, I could listen to all their music, which was so cool. After the concert I had  an opportunity to join them at the party. The best thing was that I have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and I have sung my favourite songs with them.
Secondly I am going to answer your questions. I can travel only in July because I study at an engineer's school in France and in summer we have our holidays from July.
Regarding the activities I would be very happy if I could play golf. This is a sport that I have always wanted to play but in France it is too expensive. So if I have this opportunity, I don't want to miss it. I would like to try photography too. There are so many monuments in California and so I will remember this holiday with my photographs.
I think that this experience is something that you have to live too. Perhaps at the next concert we will go together. I will keep you informed about it.
Thank you very much for your letter, which I received last week. I was delighted to hear that I won the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
How are you? I haven't heard from you for such a long time. I hope everything is alright with you. Sorry! I haven't written to you for the last two months, because I have been very busy helping and organizing the pop concert which took place near my town. Let me tell you more about what I did last month.
I had a wonderful experience helping with the pop concert last month. My duty was to help them cook for all of them during the concert. As you know I'm very good at cooking and everybody loved ! Secondly, I helped them to prepare the clothes and the costumes during the concert. Although I have never worked with clothes and art before,  I enjoyed it very much.
What I liked most about my experience at the concert was the great atmosphere behind the stage and the live music, which made me feel great and happy. What's more, I had an opportunity to meet a singer who I love and I dream about. He also gave me his address and telephone number if I need help from him in the future. I'll show you when you come around to see me.
I saw your advertisement yesterday. I have visited the Circle Theatre. I would like to say that I am not satisfied with it.
Firstly, I would like to mention  that in our daily life we always use some technological appliances. For instance, a TV-set, stereo, microwave oven and others. Another point is that with the help of  technology we can communicate with the whole world. Without doubt, the invention of the computer is the most important technological event. It is very useful. Almost everything is dependent on  computers, for example, education, research into the universe and other things.
This was a very bad evening for us. We were bored with waiting. We couldn't see Danny Brook in the show. We were hungry after the show. But we couldn't eat anything and we couldn't get a discount.
I use the Internet now. I don't buy a newspaper, because I can read my newspaper on the Internet. I can buy things on the Internet. For example, I sent a flower to my mum on mother's day .
Modern technology can affect our daily life transforming our relationship to  and the ways we communicate with other people as well as our life expectancy. With the introduction of the computer in our civilization we can access the Internet to communicate with our relatives and friends living abroad or far from us. Despite  the distances, we can keep our friendship close and in a cheap way. Besides  this, the information goes faster than it used to now and it's available at the same time in every part of the world. On the one hand, our time is taken up with learning how to deal with the new technologies. On the other hand, we can feel more comfortable with them providing us with support in our hard tasks and setting us free to apply our intelligence and efforts to more important things. For instance, we can research new ways of improving our quality of life. In conclusion, we are able to feel or to recognize the benefits of the modern technologies but we should be aware of how they are introduced into our lives to avoid the dangerous side of  TECHNOLOGY.
First of all, in your advertisement for the show you wrote that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove were taking part in the show and I was so excited about it! But I was very disappointed when I realised that another actor was taking  part. And the worst thing was that he wasn't so good in this role!
As we can understand by observing the fashion of each century, the style of dressing changes radically over the years. So we can easily understand how different the style of dressing will be  100 years from now
First, I got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and I needed some time to buy the tickets. I bought two tickets for Â£20 and when I asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then I was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, every time I tell her something, eventually everyone knows about it. But this time it was something more important than any other time. I was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when I made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to Pat, everything started going wrong. Katrin, my friend, and the one I was being bad to, was very upset with me, and she was right, but I really didn't know what to do. I was in love with Brett, but I loved my friend too. So I decided to talk to Brett. We both decided to finish with  this stupid affair. It was difficult, but it was the best for everyone. Then I decide to talk to Katrin. I was very sorry for all I had done, so I apologised to her and promised her that this  would never happen again. Now I'm very happy because I learned that friends are the most important thing in the whole world.
I am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the Circle theatre said about the musical show called 'Over The Rainbow' and the things I noticed when I was there.
In addition to all this, there was no discount on the price of the tickets for students either, contrary to what I was told on the phone when I asked for more information.
Moreover, as I had read the advertisement carefully, I had planned to invite some friends to have dinner at the theatre's restaurant. But, to our surprise, it was closed. At the end of all these , we were so puzzled and disappointed that we decided to make a complaint.
So, because of the things I have mentioned, I think I should be given some money back.
I would say that the worst thing about this development for me is that I experience more and more stress in almost every aspect of my life. There is not enough time to do a lot of things; and if I want to do them, I realize that my life is devoted to my duties without leaving any time for pleasures.
In addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive  home after an exhausting day racing against  time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
I am writing in order to complain about the Musical , OVER THE RAIN, I went to see at the theatre.
Technology changes our daily life, it makes our life easy to live and of course more comfortable  with computers, televisions, radios et cetera and sometimes safer, as with medicine.
Thank you for organising the school trip to London. I am really looking forward to participating in the programme, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to make a suggestion about the trip on behalf of all the students in my class.
It might be a good idea to fit this visit in in the afternoon on 14th March because I strongly believe that it would stimulate our interests in London so that we could study English with greater motivation. Even if we do not have enough time for shopping after the show, we will be able to go shopping during our free time on 15th March.
Secondly, no one has the right to snoop into anyone's private life even if they are journalists. Some people might say that we all have the right to know everything happening in the world as one of our human rights. However, I think that they mix them up and that they should think about the right to privacy.
In your letter you asked me when I would prefer to travel. I will be able to travel only in July because I have to work and I can take some days off in that month.
Every woman in the world likes the word shopping. It is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping.
You can go shopping alone, with friends or with your kids, but the best thing about it is that you feel that you have  while you are buying things. Maybe it is not for you, maybe you are shopping for a present, but buying things, at least for me,  is the best.
Thank you very much for your letter concerning the competition. Here is the information you require.
The aim of this report is to suggest lessons and some activities which should be filmed in the video about my school.
In my opinion, maths, politics, Chinese, English and painting lessons are the most interesting ones. They are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
As far as I know, English people are really surprised at the Chinese students' advanced level in Maths, as well as their knowledge of politics. This is a good opportunity to see how they learn in class. . You can find students using traditional Chinese ink to draw and write.
I think people don't realize how much technology rules their life. Neither do I. In particular I'd like to talk about the Internet. I think that the Internet has changed my daily life most of all. In fact, now I can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive  their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing. Therefore I regard the Internet as quite a powerful tool and I believe it has given more strength to relationships between people. In fact people meet on the Net; they learn many things; they stay in touch with friends who are abroad; and sometimes they even fall in love on the net.
Regarding your first question, I would like to travel only in July because it is my school holiday so I would not miss any classes.
As regards activities I would choose singing and surfing.  Surfing because it is my favourite sport. I have been surfing since I was a child so I am pretty good at it.  And singing because I really love it. I am not as good at singing as I am at surfing but I like doing it.
As you know, I had a great experience last month giving a helping hand to the band called RAMONES.
Afterwards, the Ramones had a short break and when they came back from their break they just went off!
I received your letter and would be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A. but I will only be able to go in July because in June I will be in Austria with a friend and for August I have rented an apartment with my family.
I would rather be accommodated in a tent because I already have the necessary equipment for camping. While I am at the camp I would like to play tennis and do photography. I play tennis very well since I have played it since I was a child but I am a novice at photography and I would like to try it as I have always been interested in it.
From the activities which you offer  me I choose swimming and tennis. I am very good at swimming. I have done this sport since I was a child and I really enjoy it. I'm not so good at tennis but I would like to play it to get some practice. Also I find that this sport is very good for my health and makes me feel better. .
I think the people who enjoy shopping  are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life. They are wasting time in their life for nothing. In my opinion we must spend more time on more interesting things than shopping, like sport, reading, chatting about ideas which make our lives better. We must do something  to help other people to feel better and be useful.
For the two activities I can choose, I would like to play tennis: I have some experience of this sport, because I played tennis for seven years and it is still my favourite activity. I would try to do some painting, too, but I have never painted.
It is wonderful to hear that there is a good variety of activities available at the camp. As I am very interested in photography and swimming I am hoping to take part in those activities. I came second in last year's swimming competition and I have enrolled in photography classes. On the camp I can practise them a lot.
Considering the advertisement, which appeared in one of  London's newspapers, I would like to present you with some of my complaints about your musical spectacle. Firstly, I would like to say that the cast, which you "advertised", has been changed. The man who played the main male role was not the one who was mentioned in the advertisement. Secondly, the time when your musical should start was changed, delaying your show for nearly one hour! In your advertisement I noticed some information about discounts which were supposed to be available - no, they were not! Another "defect" in the advertisement was an "invitation" to the restaurant after the show. For unknown  reasons, I found the restaurant closed (there was no information giving  a reason for closing it). Finally, you guaranteed "a perfect evening out", but for me it was the worst visit to the theatre in two years .
In my opinion, my daily life is full of modern technology. I meet it "at every corner": at home, at school, in the backyard and so on. It also changed my lifestyle for the better - I think. Every morning I use a toaster to have my sandwiches done, a washing machine which makes my clothes clean again. Today, modern technology means: mobile phones, computers, the Internet, super-fast cars etc. These improvements help me with my ordinary chores. I can do my homework on a computer, prepare for the class test by searching for information on the Internet and use a mobile phone every time  I want to talk with one of my parents.
However, technology has a bad influence on us - generally on our health. A couple of months ago, some foreign scientists noticed that mobile phones . Also fast and high-tech cars increase the risks of pollution in our air and mainly lead to very dangerous accidents.
First of all, I would like to know if you have some vacancies in July because it is the only month where I am on holiday. Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer staying in a tent as I used to during summer holidays when I was a child. Furthermore, you asked me to choose two activities I would like to do. Firstly, I will be happy to play tennis because I used to do this sport with my village club  and won a few competitions. Secondly, I am very interested in photography because my father is a photographer and we are used to spending time together. We had a lot of fun during our last holiday and we took a lot of pictures. As  instructions about clothes and money were not included in your letter, .
Firstly, I had no discount when I paid. Secondly there was a delay which got me into trouble. After the show I couldn't catch my train. Because I didn't have any plan I decided to have  lunch in the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. The worst thing is that I couldn't see my favourite actor. I was so disappointed about that. I couldn't concentrate on the play any more.
Nowadays students have many more facilities in education than before. Although in those days the only way of learning was reading. These days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once. Then with technology we can reach any place in the world easily. We can get  information more quickly. Technology has a huge effect on our spare-time activities as well. Children play with computers instead of the usual toys.
And last, but not least, is the fact that famous people can't express their emotions, showing their real feelings to the public. And it tells on their attitude to life and on their character. I would like to stress that very often famous people become reserved, bad-tempered and angry with the world for interfering in their lives.
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? What do you think models will wear on the catwalks? Will they wear anything? Who knows? Nowadays, people look at fashion magazines or get opinions from their friends to help them to decide what to wear on different occasions.
In my opinion, clothes will be a lot different in 100 years' time. New materials will be invented and new styles will be created either by designers or people themselves, which will lead to changes in fashion, but in addition  materials will probably still be used such as denim, which was invented ages ago in America. And people nowadays still use denim . If you walk out on to the street now, you will probably see more than half the people wearing clothes that are made of denim, which is incredibly surprising!
I would like to come in July because I work for a big company where you have to take your holiday in that month.
For the activities, I chose climbing because I took a course for 2 weeks last year and now I have a good level of proficiency.  For the other one I chose photography but I am not a professional, I just take some pictures on my holiday!
My second job was to take the money from the bars and to take it to a little room where I could see the pop stars walking in the corridor. I was very excited when I could see a star! Next weekend I have a date with one of them, but I won't tell you the name because you'll feel jealous! Maybe I will tell you in the next letter!
I would like to do photography and swimming. I love to take photos but I don't have any technique. I would like to learn more about it. I have always swum and I can say I'm good at it.
I'm looking forward to hearing from you,
I would like to choose swimming and photography as activities. I have  plenty of experience and knowledge of both .
Hi! How are you doing? I had a wonderful time last month. I helped at a pop concert as a volunteer. My jobs were collecting  tickets, selling goods and refreshments, guiding people to the right seat and cleaning up the concert hall after the concert finished. I wasn't allowed to help do  heavy work, even though I wanted to , because I'm a woman. What I particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support. It seemed that all people, the audience, the band and the staff were delightful. If I have the chance, I want to help at a concert again. I have never felt such  satisfaction. I really recommend you to help them, I think this is a good opportunity and I want you to understand my feeling well. I've got lots of things about the concert to talk to you about. I want to know your opinion.
However, we have seen an advertisement in an English magazine for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on Tuesday March 14 at 10.00-19.00. The show will have the latest fashions from the top fashion designers in the world. The leisure show will have leisure- and sports-wear, new make-up styles and new hairstyles for next year. The best thing is that it is free because we are students.
Politicians and film stars also want to have a normal life after work. They want to have a private life without journalists following them all the time. However, their news on the front page of a magazine can catch the eyes of the public so that people will never forget them. On the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
I think if the journalists want to publish the politicians' and film stars' private lives, they should ask for permission. They deserve to have a private life like everybody else. 
As  you can understand, I did not enjoy myself and I think I spent my money on a  thing. Therefore, if possible, can you pay my money back please? .
After a week on holiday, when Pandora returned she learned that all of her friends knew about that. She became very  and angry. She couldn't talk with people and she was just very sad.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. He went to see the headmaster and told him the whole truth. Tim was the one who threw the paper aeroplane at the headmaster and Jon was the one who said some bad words behind the headmaster's back after he punished Jon. The headmaster was extremely angry about it and he gave both students a heavy punishment, which was suspension from school for a week.
This happened on  Thursday afternoon. When everyone finished their lunch, they all got into their classrooms quickly because they all knew that the headmaster walked round the school every Thursday. But some naughty students in my class were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board. Unfortunately, one of the paper planes flew out of the window and hit   the headmaster's head. Everyone was laughing and the headmaster's face was full of anger. He then punished Jon but the one who did it was Tim so Jon was very angry and he said something bad about the headmaster to us. Pat heard that and he went to see the headmaster straight after school. The headmaster went to see Jon and Tim and punished them for their bad behaviour.
When I received your advertisement concerning the show "Over the Rainbow" I thought that I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me. Maybe I will start from the beginning. First of all, Danny Brook - the main actor in this musical - was absent. The show had a 45-minute delay - what a shame! You also offered discounts - what kind of discounts? I didn't see any! I was with my son (11 years old) and I had to pay for a full-price  ticket. Because the show was very long, we were getting hungry but of course your theatre restaurant was closed because of the holiday.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. The story began last year, when I  my summer holiday. I had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if I had  concrete plans. I started telling my parents that I would be travelling with my friends through West Europe for one month. I had a really good plan but no good friends. I received quite a lot of money and I left home. For one week I really was travelling with my friends but then I was getting boring with them and I started to travel alone. Now I don't think that it was a good idea. Sometimes I had to sleep on  railway stations or under  bridges. After one month, I went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun I had with my friends - I don't know why I was such a liar. My parents believed my story until my younger brother Pat told them the truth. Now my parents don't believe my story. But I think this was a good lesson for me and I don't lie any more.
Really, what a mess with the administration. Although, I would have felt better if I had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, these couldn't possibly be given either! I am sure you are smart enough to think of paying me back, so you do not lose a faithful customer.
The first thing I think of is the Internet. What a great invention! It allows me to learn anything without having to travel to lots of libraries as I used to do. It also allows me to write to my friends by e-mail. I did not write to people at all until I had got on the Internet. With this procedure, you only type and send, no need to go to the post office!
Really, . I want to do two activities: painting and tennis. The first one is for my mental health. I need a break from my lifestyle. The second one is just because I'm a fan of that sport (really I'm not martine hingis).
My first job was at the Hillsborough concert ( I think you heard about it). I was running the whole show. My responsibility was to  dress her. I wasn't alone. I worked with a staff of ten people. We had to take  some clothes off her and then to put on other completely different ones in just a few minutes (similar to Formula One).
From my point of view I can complain only about the small concert hall and the fact there were artists from only six countries. Nowadays many people are fond of classical music, but this concert was too small. That's why many people missed this classical concert.
One day Ivan caught a fish. It wasn't a normal fish. It was a Gold Fish and it talked to him like a human: ' Please, let me go and I can do anything you want for you'. But Ivan was such a kind person that he let Gold Fish go without making any conditions.
Madrid, 17 - June - 2000 Dear SIR/MADAM, My name is ....I work as an actor for The Spanish Royal Theatre. I spent the whole of last week in London with one of my colleagues. Sunday night we went to your theatre. We thought that going to the musical show "Over The Rainbow" would be (as you say in your advertisement) the perfect evening out and the perfect end to our stay in your city. But from the beginning we had a lot of problems. Despite  being actors we had to pay for a full-price ticket because the discounts you promise are not available on Sundays. We tried to complain but the girl at the ticket desk was very impolite. However, we decided to go to the show. Danny Brook is a good friend of mine and our intention was to give him a surprise. You can imagine what our faces were like when we saw that it was not Danny, but Peter Fox, who was on the stage. Nevertheless we decided to stay  till the end of the show and to have dinner in your restaurant, where we were supposed to meet some friends; friends that we never met because your restaurant was closed when we got out. I am sure that the restaurant closed at its closing time but you have to remember that the show began 45 minutes late. As you can see it was not our "perfect evening out" at all. I was really disappointed. I realize that managing a theatre is  hard work but I have to ask you for the money for the tickets back. Next time it would be a good idea to put the possible changes in the advertisement, before the start of the show. I am waiting for your answer,
Technology has also been a great help in my everyday work. I am thinking mostly of computers. Being a journalist I have to write lots of pages every day. The computer allows me to change my ideas without any effort and to store a large amount of information in the minimum space.
I think all people like shopping. When you ask some people to express their opinions about shopping they might tell you they don't like shopping but I don't suppose it is true. For example , when someone asked me about shopping I would say that I didn't like it. However, now if someone asks me the same question my answer will be, "Yes, I like it". When people hear this word shopping they only think about going to some stores and trying on new clothes or shoes and searching for their size and so on. They don't think about other kinds of shopping which are . Maybe they like shopping on the Internet or window shopping; it doesn't matter what kind of shopping they like. There are a lot of shopping styles in the world. I am sure everybody likes one of them.
My girlfriend and I read an advertisement for the show "Over the Rainbow", which is very popular. She is fond of the actor Danny Brook so I decided to buy two tickets, provided there were discounts available. When we asked for discount tickets, we were told there never were discount offers and that we had to pay for the most expensive tickets - Â£20 each - because we were not English students. We were annoyed about it but we paid up. We took our places, and began chatting with other people. We had to wait until 8.15 pm before it started, whereas the show was supposed to start at 9.30 pm! Moreover, we were astonished that another actor we did not know was playing the role of Danny Brook. My girlfriend was very upset and so was I.
I think men will still wear pants and jackets but maybe not  jeans. Synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so they would keep going . But maybe the shape of the clothes will change: large "baggy" pants, or trousers with many pockets as we see today. For women, clothes change more than for men. It maybe because they are more likely to try new ways of dressing. I guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because they want to change. Finally it's very difficult to say what .
Among the staff you can also find young people and have fun with them during  work.
I was pleased to hear from you last week. Now I am writing to you because a story by Agatha Christie is going to be read on the radio. Its title is "Accident"
Secondly the plot. It is about a woman who poisoned her first husband. At least this is Evans' opinion. Not only is the plot interesting but also it catches your interest from the first moment.
I recently visited London on holiday and during my stay I went to your theatre to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I am really sorry to say that I was very disappointed with the whole organisation of the musical, starting with the advertisement. Firstly, in the advertisement it says that the main actor was supposed to be Danny Brook, an actor that I admire and I wanted to see  performing. Unfortunately, instead of Brook I saw another actor, totally unknown to me. Secondly, in the advertisement, the starting time of the musical was said to be  19:30, but the show started at 20:15. I don't want to be rude, but this is not professional at all. Another thing I would like to mention is the discount that we were supposed to have on the tickets.
There wasn't any discount. Lastly I would like to inform you that I wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock, and the musical finished at 11:30. So I am asking you: why do you advertise it if is not going to be available to the audience?
In conclusion I would like to say that modern technology offers   humanity  many things, some of them are good and some others are not so good. It's up to us if we  use those technological achievements in the right way, and make our lives easier. The only thing I really  is that if you know how to use technology, it is a benefit to you. If you don't, it is going to destroy you.
The trip that you have planned for us students is a great chance to meet new people and visit a beautiful city . Your programme is excellent because it tries to offer  the students the best way to spend their time without wasting time with silly places or events. We'd like to thank you because this kind of event shows how dedicated you are to our school and the students that study there. It's especially great to visit the Science Museum, because of its exhibitions.
Our suggestion is that you could change . In this way, the leisure time would be on Tuesday and we would be able to go to the London Fashion Show. Thanks for your attention and we're waiting for your answer.
It's important to respect other people's lives because  can cause serious problems for the family of the person or in his life. If the famous person doesn't mind  being filmed in his personal life there's no problem. But if the politicians or the film stars ask for privacy the media has to respect that. Everybody likes to be with their family without any reporter or photographer hanging around.
I am writing to you to express my disappointment with the musical show 'Over the rainbow.
First, I am very disappointed about the star. I went to the musical to see Danny Brook acting and singing, but he didn't appear. Instead of him, there was an unknown actor, who I dislike.
Another thing is that there were not any discounts on the entrance fee.
But, then my mother talked to Pat's mother and she mentioned it, and my mother cancelled the trip to Africa.
I was happy at the end as the weekend tickets were reasonably priced for all events.  I thought it was worthwhile to have spent two days at the Arts Festival in the end.
On the way they were thirsty so when they looked into the lake, they saw a long bar of gold.  The widower told the widow leave it alone as they couldn't share it when the widow told him.  They kept going on until they met a fat, small man.  He came and said to the widower that he was to take him on his back.  The widow, who was afaid, told the man about the gold.
When the man hurriedly ran to the lake, all he found was a long snake.  He was just able to kill it by cutting the snake in half by using his knife which was as sharp as a sickle.
I'M WRITING TO YOU TO DESCRIBE MY DISAGREEABLE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR THEATRE  LAST SATURDAY, AT YOUR SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW".
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS SATURDAY WAS MY HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY AND I WAS PLANNING THIS DAY FOR ONE MONTH. MY INTENTION WAS TO HAVE A SPECIAL NIGHT WITH HIM. AND IT WAS REALLY SPECIAL!!!
YOUR SHOW STARTED ALMOST ONE HOUR LATE AND WITHOUT ANY DISCOUNT FOR US ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKETS. BUT THAT WASN'T THE WORST, BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND THE TROUBLES OF PUTTING ON A PLAY IN THE THEATRE. BUT WHAT I CANNOT FORGIVE  YOUR COMPANY IS CHANGING THE TIME IT STARTS AT THE LAST MINUTE, MY HUSBAND IS A DANNY BROOK'S FAN AND HE FELT REALLY DISAPPOINTED.
THAT ISN'T ALL. WHEN THE SHOW WAS FINISHED, WE WANTED TO GO TO DINNER, AS YOU SUGGESTED IN THE PROGRAMME, BUT THE RESTAURANT WAS CLOSED BECAUSE IT WAS !!!
Of course I want to get my money back, but I know that I will never get it. So in  conclusion I want to give you one piece of advice - try to organise your shows more carefully.
So, I think that modern technology gives us a lot of opportunities to do the things that are really important in our lives.
That is all I would like to recommend you do. I would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
I agree that  famous people's lives should be  private. It is of benefit to themselves and the public.
And I'd like to stay in a log cabin. I've had unpleasant experiences on my last holidays when I had to stay in a tent. In addition, as I haven't stayed in a cabin, I look forward to staying in a cabin.
I am writing, on behalf of all my English class, to thank you for the opportunity you are giving us to spend three days in London, but also to suggest some modifications to the programme.
The programme you have already organised is very interesting, especially because it provides a good combination of cultural visits and more relaxed activities.
In conclusion, I suggest that we go directly to the show after the Science Museum. We all agree that we have enough time on Wednesday for shopping.
I hope that you will agree to this suggestion. I am waiting for your answer.
Your programme for Tuesday is very interesting. Fortunately, there is the London fashion and leisure show, which is held once a year. This show would give us a lot of information about current activities, fashion and what is happening here in London with, for example, the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles.
I am looking forward to hearing your opinion about my suggestion.
"Home" has so much meaning for  people. It doesn't matter who they are, where they come from, what colour  skin they have.
Home is an institution that creates humans and makes them   people and  good members of their communities.
These 2 feelings cannot be replaced by any Technology but we can use them to make a better home in the future.
I am writing to you  to answer the questions in your letter.
If I get two choices, I would like to go swimming and take photographs. Because I grew up in a town that is a seaside city, I started training in 1996, and I have never given it up. In particular, it was really good for my health . Photography is my hobby . I can remember that I used to take photographs of the exhibitions or during the holidays. It will be nice  when I am older. In addition, it could show people how nice the places I have been are and the . Therefore, I would like to do those two activities.
In my opinion, women really enjoy shopping. . However, we are going to change from the traditional system to  "e-shopping". It is new for customers. With technology they can switch on the computer and click everything they want. Therefore, it  and is also boring for the customer. I think most  men dislike shopping. They are always waiting for a long time for women to finish their shopping.
I have recently been to the Circle Theatre and watched the musical show - Over the Rainbow. I am writing to you because there were deviations from the advertisement which was published in the newspaper.
The advert clearly says that discounts are available, but when I was buying the tickets, I . As a result, I had to pay the full price of Â£15. The second point is that the show  about 30 minutes. Although I believe there must have been problems, I expect your company managed to sort it out in the quickest way. Apart from that, the most disappointing fact is that there were different actors instead of Danny brook and Tina Truelove, because of whom I . After the show we went to the theatre restaurant, but it was closed for  refurbishment.
I was not really satisfied with the show and I certainly believe that it was not a perfect evening out. I therefore would like to have a refund of the Â£30 which I spent on the tickets.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. My story had already been spread  the next day. Although failing in the exams wasn't really a big deal, it was awful that people kept mentioning it. I didn't think I was going to survive after failing the exams and my best friend had been untrustworthy. But  since I noticed in the newspaper that I had won the writing competition. I couldn't believe my luck. I  a return ticket to the Mediterranean Sea. During the trip, I made friends with other people who had also won the competition in their towns. They were so kind to me that we soon became good friends. For the last few days, we spent our time  sightseeing and shopping. I must admit that it was the greatest time I have ever had in my life. On the last day when I was packing and getting ready to leave, I realised I had lost my passport and tickets. A horrible thought suddenly came into my mind. My bad luck had never left me. It had only hidden away from me and when there was a chance, it was going to give me a 'surprise'.
Last week, I had a week's holiday in London, where I hadn't been for 2 years. I prepared everything for my family and wanted to enjoy it. We were happy all the time, but, unfortunately, , which was your musical show. At first, you said that if we bought 5 tickets, we would have a discount, but we didn't . Secondly, we booked for the show at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. What's wrong with your clock? Thirdly, the person on stage was very strange to me, because I expected to see "Danny Brook", but I didn't. The last thing is we wanted to have  dinner in your restaurant after the terrible musical show, but we couldn't , because a waiter said your chef had gone home. I have no idea . I have never seen anything like this.
By the way, I want you to give me my money back because of the wasted time, and I think that you understand.
Let me express how disappointed I feel at this particular moment, or I should say angry, better sad. I would never have expected that I could be so deceived. This is not the first time I have been to your theatre and I have to tell you I have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure "Over the rainbow" will be the last one. As I am specially fond of musicals, I even travel abroad to see what's new, I am probably one of your most devoted customers. I know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business. We both know this is not true, or shouldn't be. When someone comes specially to see Danny Brook acting, one of my favourite singers, whose career I have been following from the beginning, and Danny Brook never appears, and nobody gives any reason to the audience, how should one feel? There was no reason either for the delay. Almost an hour! Can you imagine how many things one could do instead. Even playing some music to help us take it easy would have been better than nothing! No announcement, no ...oh, yes, I forgot. The bar was closed. Well, I will not comment on that point. That terrible place definitely needed  refurbishment.
Of course, you should give a refund for the money spent, not only to me but to all the audience. But I can say that you will never be able to give my appreciation for your theatre back, at least not as long as you continue as its manager.
It is almost true to say that fashion is one of the most exciting human activities nowadays. How can we define this crazy and continuous change of colours, shapes, patterns, and uses? New fabrics create new textures, all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals that will last, as always, just a few weeks. Everything that is in fashion passes away in a couple of months and has to be created again.
How has modern technology changed my daily life? Fifty years ago people didn't even think that after 2000 years they would have another life. When Thomas Adison invented  electric light, it was the greatest invention for people of that century. And nowadays modern technology can change all our lives. I mean, almost everyone now has a car, a computer, a mobile phone and even an airplane. My life is changing too. First of all, now I can phone my friends and parents from every place, I can chat with other foreign teenagers with the help of the Internet. Second, modern technology helps me in the kitchen. Cooking has become faster with the help of the microwave. What is more, modern technology prevents different illnesses. Furthermore, yesterday I heard that every man could fly into  space without any experience, it is great, from my point of view, that in the year 2050 everybody will fly into  space.
I am writing to complain about the show that I saw the other day at your theatre.
- the show started at 20:15 and not at 19.30. Please check your times because many people had to leave in the middle of the show.
Modern technology has changed my life in many different ways: But this "modern technology" has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand we have the advantages;  new technology allows you to do many things like flying, seeing in the dark, or it can even save your life when you are almost dead. But on the other hand we have the disadvantages. Technology makes your life easier but for how long? For example, the car was developed through  modern technology. It makes your life easier but also more "dangerous". Why? Because too many cars means too much CO2 in the air. And everyone knows that CO2 is a very dangerous gas for all kinds of animals. To summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates  many problems.
Regarding  "Over The Rainbow", presented at your theatre last night, I would like to inform you of the following problems.
Firstly, the starring actor was different from the one who had been mentioned in the advertisement for this musical show as "Danny Brook". As I was so looking forward to seeing Danny's performance, I was very disappointed. I think you should have informed us of the change of star before starting  the show. In addition, I'd like to know the reason why the actor was replaced.
Secondly, the show started at 20:15 instead of 19:30 as mentioned in the advertisement.
But, Mark, Pat and I were planning a birthday party for Sally on June 2 at her own home. It should have been "surprising". Sally's husband is now in Singapore on business, so she had to spend her birthday without him. Considering her loneliness, we made every effort to please her and to encourage her; because she was loved by everybody for her gentle, kind and lovely character. She was not so lucky in her life. Her parents had already died when she was in  high school. She has no brothers and sisters. After marriage, Sally and her husband Nigel realized that they would not be able to have  children. In spite of such difficulties, she always has a pretty, charming smile for us.
When Sally came out of the discotheque I was very angry and I started to shout at her. She hit me and I decided then that I should never speak to her again.
Personally, I think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attend , and we are all interested in the latest fashion. We noticed that it is free for students, so the price of the trip will not rise.
Well, I suppose that almost everything in our future house will be automatic and will respond to what people say. Perhaps, there will be personal computers which will control everything, every item of furniture, light, temperature. Moreover, they will be able to create a special climate for each room. But, on the other hand, people will still have to programme them, as they have to do nowadays. Maybe children will not have to go to school, they will just stay in their rooms and study on a computer, gaining some kind of on-line education. All the rubbish, dust, dirty dishes, plates, cups will be washed automatically. It is possible that only one computer will do all this and it will have its own personality, voice, eyesight..
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WHICH OCCURRED WITH THE LAST MUSICAL SHOW AT THIS THEATRE.
AS IF THIS WERE NOT ENOUGH, I DID NOT OBTAIN A DISCOUNT ON THE PRICE OF THE TICKET, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO YOUR LEAFLET.
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, I COULD NOT VISIT THE RESTAURANT AT THIS PLACE, BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED AFTER THE SHOW.
FINALLY, WE SHOULD CONSIDER, TOO, THAT  TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN PROVIDING US WITH IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES, MAINLY IN MATTERS OF HEALTH, THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON.
Then I'd like to choose the tents for my accommodation when at Camp California. I think sleeping in a tent is more fun than other . Also, during my stay at Camp, there are two activities I can choose. For one of them I will choose Basketball because it is the sport I play most. I and my friend used to win the first  in the  match when we were at school. And for the other one, I think painting will be a good idea; painting is one of my hobbies and I've been studying it since I was 5 years old and now I'm still doing it when I have some free time.
Above is all the information you asked for. However, there are some things I'd like to know; the first is about the clothes. What kind of clothes do I need to take with me? And another question is what are the prices of things like  there, which I want to know so that I can make a better budget for my trip.
Thanks for your last letter; I knew you would be interested in my experience of helping at the pop concert . Now I will tell you about it.
But in the breaks and after work, I had a chance to talk with the engineers, and I learnt something about setting up the equipment.
When I saw the advertisement for the show it was written that the show would start at a half past seven but it started at a quarter past eight.
First of all, I would like to travel in July, because, during the other months, I will be studying, preparing myself for  exams or I will be away travelling somewhere else with my relatives.
I have been thinking and I decided I would prefer to stay in a tent, simply because it's a new experience and I would like to try everything new. Also, it seems more dangerous. Regarding the two activities I have to choose, I decided to choose a new activity that I have never done before, which is Sailing.  I am a total beginner at this. The other activity is Photography. I am not an expert, but I know how to use a camera.  All I want is to improve my knowledge.
Finally, I need to know what kind of clothes and how many clothes I should pack. Is there any place where I can wash my clothes? I also need some information about the money I should take. Do you have any kind of souvenirs that I can buy? Do I need to take any money at all?
When I arrived to help them, they welcomed me and were so nice to me that it seemed we had known each other for ages! They weren't the kind of people that think they're gods.
My name is Volencia Vardez. I am writing to complain about the services that you are offering at the shows at your theatre.
Last May, I had a week's holiday in London, and during my trip I decided to buy tickets for OVER THE RAINBOW, the MUSICAL . I was really excited about the idea of seeing that show.
First of all, when I arrived, I found a note stuck on the front door that informed me about changes to the list of performers. Danny Brook was ill. He was replaced by another actor whose abilities were poor.
When she finished  school, she went to study at the Agent Training Agency where she learnt about guns, clues, agencies, etc. She was the best student they had ever had.
At first she walked around the bay-side market, looking at all the people who were there. When she saw a man, different from the rest, talking with one of the salesmen, she interrupted immediately and told  the man that she was a secret agent. Obviously the man realised that she was looking for him and said that she was really crazy!
You can imagine what happened to her cover .
I really wish you had been there with me on  one of the exciting nights in my life. Now I can't wait to tell you every detail. Are you ready?
It was a pop concert by Steps in the M.E.N Arena. And I was initially employed to be an entrance assistant whose job was to keep the queue under control as well as keeping the area clean.
I'm writing to complain about the musical show named OVER THE RAINBOW. According to your advertisement, it is  LONDON'S NEWEST AND BEST MUSICAL SHOW, but I was deeply disappointed with it.
According to your advertisement, the stars were DANNY BROOK AND TINA TRUELOVE. I decided to go to see this show because of its stars, but on the day I saw it, a different actor performed. He was not DANNY BROOK.
Below are my suggestions for what should be filmed.
I'm sorry to be writing to you about such a bad thing, but my evening at your theatre wasn't as perfect as you advertised: it wasn't perfect at all! I was pleased to be seeing Danny Brooke, he's my favourite actor, so you can easily imagine how disappointed I was when I saw a different and unknown actor on the stage! By the way, what really upset me was the starting time. According to your advertisement it started at 19:30, and what a surprise when I had to wait almost an hour until the show started at 20:15! Now let's talk about the tickets. You had promised discounts on the cost, which was from Â£10 to Â£20, but despite what I thought I had to pay Â£20 without any other options. In the end, I thought I could enjoy myself visiting the theatre restaurant but it was closed because of something they didn't explain to me.
I had an unpleasant experience. It was at lunchtime. Everybody  had gone to buy lunch in the supermarket. In fact, nobody likes crowds and queues, especially not in the summertime. I was queuing . I chose this aisle because I thought it was quicker than the others. . Suddenly the customer thought the receipt was not right. She did not buy a lot of things but the shop assistant did not make a mistake. They argued about this thing. The shop manager came to solve it. Obviously, I had to try another aisle. It was the longest queue I have ever been in.
In conclusion, on the whole the Festival was a success, but these suggestions can maybe help you to improve it.
As you know, I finished school two years ago. This year, I started a private school in Dijon. So the rules are clear, you need to participate in the lessons and also pass the exam in June 2000. In our class, we don't have a problem with students who dislike working, because we are all there for the same reasons and nobody wants to stay there for years and years. It is also expensive and I can't afford to stay there too long.
In my  home, my parents let me do what I want, because I am an adult now. But when we are out, we have to be careful not to disturb the other people. It is the same in our family. For example, my parents dislike hearing music throughout the whole house . When I go out, they don't give me a time to be  home, because I'm sensible.
As you can see I had a very disappointing evening - the worst one of my week's holiday in London. I would like therefore to have my money back, so please send me a cheque for Â£20 to  the address above.
I think in the future people will express themselves by wearing appropriate clothes. There will be a mixture of styles from different times in the past, so if you feel like a medieval princess, you can dress like one. New technology and science will change fabrics, so they will change their colours during the day.
In the future people will be even more concerned about pollution and harmful UV-rays. So their clothes will have built-in protective filters to help them keep healthy.
Firstly, the best date for me to travel will be in the second week of July because I will be very busy at any other time for work reasons.
Secondly I would prefer sleeping in a log cabin because I would feel much more comfortable. One reason is the cold, and the other is that I cannot sleep on the floor because I have problems with my back.
It would be a great pleasure to spend two weeks at Camp California and I can't find any suitable words to express my enthusiasm. First of all, as a reply to your letter, I'd like to say, that I can only go on this camp in July because I have a full-time job and it is essential not to leave it for a long time. In July I can make an exception. With regards accommodation I would prefer log cabins, as they are more comfortable and I like convenience. As for the list of activities, I choose climbing and surfing. I like new challenges, even when I've never done them before, and I'm really looking forward to gaining this new kind of experience. If you don't mind I would like to ask you some vital questions. Do I have to take warm clothes? How much money would you recommend me to take?
I would appreciate it if you sent me a reply to my Questions as soon as possible
,,Shopping is not always enjoyable". From my point of view it is a very controversial issue, and we can't just easily claim whether it is enjoyable or not. It only depends on the person who is actually doing it and some convenient circumstances like a huge amount of money in our bank account. Some people don't like doing shopping at all and they can well explain to everyone why it isn't enjoyable. Luckily, I'm one of these people. First of all, shopping is a waste of time. People just run from one shop to another and they just can't decide what to buy. During the rush hour, shopping is almost impossible due to big queues in every single shop in the nearby area. I just can't understand people who, with a smile on their faces, spend their last money on unnecessary but expensive things. They are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous.
Here are the problems with your show. In your advertisement, it says that Danny Brook will act but he did not. It was a different actor and I was very disappointed. It says that the show starts at 14:30 and 19:30 but the show started at 20:15 which was 45 minutes late.
The modern technology which changed my daily life most is the personal computer. I can do a lot of things using the computer. I can play games, listen to music, and I can do my course work on the computer.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the only reason why  she had not got a lot of friends. When Pat first came  into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems. But after a few times the others would see that Pat couldn't keep secrets. So they stopped telling her anything important almost immediately. Sometimes it finished with the others only saying: "Hello, how are you?" And then going away without listening to the answer. This made Pat sad and she became very quiet. During the day she worked hard so she would not think too much. But at night, when it became dark the dreams would come. She dreamed about good friends, the time that had long passed by and she dreamed of someone who she could tell her own secrets.
Then one day she met this person. It was Katha, a girl who had the same problem as Pat. So they both found the person they dreamed of.
Dear Sir or Madam, I recently went to The Circle Theatre in order to see Over the Rainbow, and it has been quite . I am writing to you to complain about five or six utterly outrageous facts. In the advertisement for the show, which I had picked up in the hall of the theatre, there are about five points which were not true. To begin with, as far as the cast is concerned, Danny Brook should have performed as the main character, and I saw at the very beginning of the show that he did not. Insofar as I came here especially to see him play, I have been very disappointed, and this could be the understatement of the year,  as he is my favourite actor. Apart from that, the show should have begun at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! Could you explain to me the reasons for such a huge delay? Thirdly, the ad mentioned possible discounts. Personally speaking, I didn't see them and didn't even hear of them: I asked about it, but nobody seemed to know anything concerning discounts. On top of that, the restaurant was closed for renovation! How can you dare publish an advertisement for a theatre restaurant if you obviously know it is closed? To put it in a nutshell, and quite honestly, I would like to emphasize  the fact that I did not have a "perfect evening out" at all, such as  was promised in the ad. For all these reasons, I would like, dear Sir or Madam,  you to give me my money back. I am looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,
It all began when Paul went downstairs in the Heavy Sleep. As he closed his eyes, he started to travel along the dark paths of his conscience. He went through the valleys, plains and mountains of the Dream Landscape. He finally arrived in Faerie, a country of elder elves and strong white-bearded dwarves
All of a sudden, a weird creature popped into his dream. She was taller than a dwarf and as thin as a dying tree. Paul was wondering whether this beast could be aggressive when the creature said these words, "I am glad to meet you, Paul." The boy could not believe  what he was hearing. How did the beast know his name? "You see, I am a mere product of your mind, but I would like to get out of the Heavy Sleep. Please, bring me with you, into your reality!"
At these words, Paul suddenly awoke. Relieved, he thought that bringing the creature into his world would have revealed the existence of Faerie, and with it, threatened the ecology of the Dream Landscape, when he heard a creepy sound under his bed. He jumped out of his room, locked the door and found his brother, Pat. He told him about his adventures and asked him not to repeat them.
Unfortunately...one hour after that, a local zoo keeper arrived and caught the creature in order to put her in a cage. There she died because  she did not have the Faerian food necessary for her survival.
During my recent holiday in London I visited one of your shows at the "Circle Theatre". The show was called "Over the rainbow" and should be, to quote the advertisement, London's newest and best musical show. But I was very disappointed. I was very pleased that the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. When I saw that you had changed Danny Brook for someone else I was very disappointed.
Moreover I would like to tell you that the show should have begun at 19:30 but it started after a delay of 45 minutes. I do not think that this delay is acceptable. Furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but I had to pay the full price although I am a student.
First of all, I was attracted by the actors - Danny Brooks and Tina Truelove - and not by the actors who performed effectively that evening. These actors appeared  forty-five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement. This lateness prevented me from going to dinner in your restaurant because it was just closing!
I think these are the reasons for his willpower. Although the fish is eaten by the sharks, he is the winner, the winner of himself. He could have triumphed over the fish because of his knowledge of the sea but it is principally because he has  in the depths of his mind.
I have just received your letter of congratulations and I am writing to you in order to provide you with information you need.
First of all, I would like to start with the time of the trip. I would prefer to go to the Camp in July. The reasons for my choice are that I am having my graduation exams in June and my entrance exams in August.
The next things to be shot, according to the majority of students, should be the teaching process and the breaks. Obviously it will be interesting to find out what methods are used by our teachers to help pupils understand their subject better. Here I should also mention the decor of our classrooms and the atmosphere in them. People should see all the renovations that have been done during the last few years and all the modern conveniences that were installed for both students and teachers.
All these exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.
 Almost everyone relates famous people with photographers, articles, money, fans ... Normally, one person's dream is to be rich and famous but without that stuff about being without privacy
Nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance ... but not everyone does the same thing. On the one hand you find the ones that are well known and never talk about their private life. They use the publicity exclusively for their work.
Between the tent and log cabin, I think that I would prefer the tent. It will let me get up  close to nature, and experience life in the wild. Living in a tent will also enhance my survival skills, making this a trip to remember.
Camp California certainly has plenty of activities to do. However, among all of them I like swimming and tennis the best. I have a lot of experience with swimming and have represented my school before. As for tennis, I find it very enjoyable and have gone for proper lessons.
The concert was held in our school hall. All the students had to help to brighten up the place, and boy did we work. I helped to decorate the walls. My friends and I managed to paint a smart navy blue on the old, faded green. It wasn't as easy as I had expected, there are special equipment and techniques which must be used to ensure a good result.
I also helped with the lighting and studio equipment. I fixed the lighting on the ceiling and attached several spotlights to the walls. This produced a stunning effect during the concert. I also got to install new speakers so that the music could be heard clearly throughout the hall.
I will have graduated from university by the end of June and I will be available for this trip only in July because I will have to start working with my parents in August. I've always stayed in tents when I have been on the university camps so I would prefer log cabins at Camp California because it would be a new experience for me and I would also learn how to live in one.
Considering your activities at the Camp, I would choose singing and painting because I am the lead singer in the university band and I think I will be good at this activity. Also painting is my hobby because I have always painted when I have some spare time. I would be grateful if you could tell me some details about what type of clothes and how much money I should bring.
Once again, thank you for giving me a good opportunity. I look forward to going to your camp in the near future.
Most people enjoy going shopping every weekend but some think that shopping is not always enjoyable for different reasons and .
We were very disappointed! Of course, the show didn't start on time. No reasons or excuses were given. Our travel agent told us that it would be cheaper to purchase our tickets directly from the theatre. But, in fact, there were no discounts available. And we had to pay Â£20 a seat.
I have just received your letter. I was glad to know I had won first prize in the competition and I am writing to reply about the camp.
In the first part of this book it can be seen that Woods is not on the side of the blacks although he didn't approve of the government's attitude towards them. In some ways, he did not agree with "Black Consciousness" which is Biko's organization because it was too much against the whites. Woods thought he knew the black society quite well and understood their ordeals, but after he had met Biko and visited a black township, he realized he had been completely unaware of the way they had to live. The people and the circumstances he experienced in the black township were such a new world to him. Finally he changed his ideas and started to work for the blacks using his skill as a journalist. In other words, he became an activist for the black people of South Africa.
Dear Ms. Ryan, I am writing to you in reply to your letter. Firstly, I would like to travel in July, because it is summer , and there will be nice weather to enjoy in California. Secondly, I would prefer  to stay in a log cabin, because I am allergic to some insects that might get in a tent. As regards the activities, I would enjoy tennis, because I have some experience playing, and my spin and volley are very good, and painting, because I have learnt some techniques that I would like to put into practice. Lastly, I would like to know if I need to bring any special clothes, and where I can change my money to American dollars cheaply. I would like to ask for your prompt reply, so I can start organizing myself. Thanking you, Yours sincerely, Carmen Dolores Rossell
What I personally liked the most was all our teamwork. I could see the staff, managers, artists and even the director, all as a big team, working together. That was what made it really special. Try it, I recommend it.
I am writing to you about an  that I had at your last musical at the Circle Theatre. I went to see "Over the rainbow" last Saturday and I had a very disappointing evening.
I read in your advertisement in Friday's edition of the Times that the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15. I was waiting 45 minutes for nothing!
As mentioned in the newspaper, I didn't have a perfect evening out and I ask you to give me back my money.
My life changes every day because of  modern technology. For example, if I don't have time to do my shopping after school because I have to do my homework, I go on the Internet and ask for what I need. The day after I get everything at home by post.
Finally, after all these disappointments, I was not able to have dinner in your theatre restaurant. It was closed for some reason I still don't know.
Pat was a teacher of English as a foreign language. Sometimes he had liked to surprise his class with a test to see how good they would be when they could not have revised for it in advance. And always, everybody did it surprisingly well.
I am waiting to hear from you.
I would prefer to stay in log cabins because the weather is going to be rainy, according to the forecast. Therefore, I have chosen golf and tennis from the list. I have been playing them for more than 3 years, during which I have been trained, 3 years for tennis, 1 year for golf, by  professional coaches. I enjoy playing both of them regularly.
I would not dare to calculate how much I have spent on those things without thinking. However, it was not bad. My mum always told me that I hadn't  earned enough money so  I shouldn't have spent it in the wrong way.
I came to see my favourite actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but the actors whom I saw were other people. Another thing is that I took a particular amount of money to buy  tickets and when I appeared in front of the ticket desk I found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price weren't the same, the real price was much higher. Also the show started very late compared to what was written in the advertisement. And I think you know how it is just sitting and waiting for 45 minutes before the beginning?
Begin at the beginning. Look at the history books for 400-600 years ago, or even for the time of the First and Second World Wars, to see how  society has changed, just because we  stepped up  the advance of science and technology.
On the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before. I think this  because before the effect on our health was less than it is now. More and more people die from some illnesses whereas a long time ago fewer people died from the same illnesses, despite the fact that they had fewer medicines.
Society has to go forward not to stop in one place.
First of all, I want to thank you  for this prize. I am very excited because I have never won a prize. I have never been to the USA, so I think that this trip will be an unforgettable experience.
Although all the activities that you mention are very interesting, I prefer swimming and tennis. I think that I am very good at swimming. I won a local competition when I was seventeen. I am not so good at tennis because I began to play only two years ago. Finally, I would like to ask you how the weather will be in July and what kind of clothes I have to wear. Furthermore, I would like to know   I have to take and what amount of money is normally spent in the camp. I look forward to receiving your reply.
In my opinion shopping could be a 'dangerous' activity because you may spend more money on some clothes than you can afford. I know people who are overdrawn because of shopping. Despite shopping being boring, I think that it is necessary because it is important for people to have several items of clothing and also suitable clothes for a very important meeting or appointment.
I hope you won't be too angry about this change but we would all like to go to the show.
On behalf of the class
The years went by and after buying a newer, faster and better PC I found myself writing letters, doing  homework and in the evening learning with my Computer. In spite of my family telling me to turn the PC off and talk to them, I kept on, stuck in front of the screen.
First of all our class would like to give you our special thanks for the programme you gave us yesterday afternoon.
After reading the whole  programme, we all agreed about the sightseeing tour by bus around London, which will give us the knowledge of this fantastic city we have all wanted to have since a long time ago.
The main purpose of our letter is to explain about the London Fashion and Leisure Show. We found the advertisement in a local newspaper  and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists of these topics:
I'm terribly sorry but I have to inform you about a very disappointing evening. I'm sure you'll read this letter with the intention of explaining the problems I had during the musical show at your theatre. One of the causes of my disappointment was the substitute actor that played in the show.
I AM WRITING IN ORDER TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE SHOW "OVER THE RAINBOW", PERFORMED 2 WEEKS AGO; FIRST OF ALL, I READ IN THE ADVERTISEMENT THAT DANNY BROOK WAS TO ACT IN THE SHOW, BUT THE ACTOR THAT REALLY PLAYED WAS A DIFFERENT ONE , AND THIS WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING. THEN, THE SHOW WAS TO BEGIN AT 19:30, BUT IT BEGAN ONLY AT 20.15!
AS REGARDS THE TICKETS, I READ THAT DISCOUNTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT IT WAS NOT SO, AND I HAD TO PAY THE FULL PRICE. MOREOVER, AFTER THE SHOW, I INTENDED TO VISIT YOUR THEATRE RESTAURANT, BUT IT WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO EXPLANATION FOR THAT. FINALLY, YOU PROMISED IN YOUR ADVERTISEMENT A PERFECT EVENING OUT; AS IT WAS NOT SO, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK.
FASHION: THIS TERM EVOKES TOP MODELS, STYLISTS, COLOURS AND THE GREAT EUROPEAN CAPITAL CITIES, LIKE ROME, LONDON AND PARIS. BUT IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DEFINE IT OR TO FIX THE RULES WITHIN WHICH IT DEVELOPS; NOWADAYS THE FASHION WORLD INCLUDES (AND IS CREATED BY) DESIGNERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD, EACH ONE PRESENTING A DIFFERENT MODEL OF BEAUTY, SOMETIMES ONE THE OPPOSITE OF ANOTHER. I THINK THAT FASHION IN THE FUTURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG VERY DIFFERENT LINES: THERE MAY BE A RETURN TO THE FASHION OF THE PAST, AS WE CAN NOTICE  NOW, OR A MORE FANTASTIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. SURELY, ORDINARY PEOPLE WILL NOT FOLLOW ONLY THE MODELS PRESENTED ON TV. AS REGARDS EVERYDAY LIFE, I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE ATTENTION WILL BE FOCUSED ON COMFORT MORE THAN ON ELEGANCE. BUT IF IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST THE DEVELOPMENTS OF THE FASHION WORLD, IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST THOSE OF THE COMMON PEOPLE, THAT IS A TOO VARIED A CATEGORY.
I am only available in July because I am studying at an engineering school and I'll work until the end of June. But no problem for July!
You asked me which type of accommodation I would prefer between a tent and a log cabin. I am used to spending summer holidays in a tent and I like it, but why not try a log cabin? But it doesn't matter if there is no log cabin available... Now let's speak about the most interesting activity: sport. I would be very pleased if I could do tennis and surfing. In fact, I  play tennis and I am quite good at it, and it will be an opportunity to train .  Surfing is completely new to me and I hope that I will like it. But if I don't try it I will never know if I like it or not!
Regarding the information you need, I have to tell you that I can only go in July, for work reasons. Once there, I would prefer staying in a tent, because that is a way to remember my childhood as a Boy Scout and get a break from the routine.
The day of the show I worked so hard that I couldn't see the show. And I didn't even get paid. But it was worth it. I got my reward when the concert finished. After  carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, I was exhausted. But when Britney came off the stage, she passed by me, saw my tired face and invited me into her personal dressing room. We talked for about half an hour and when she said goodbye she gave me a kiss. I won't forget that moment ever. Write to me soon to tell me your thoughts about what happened to me. Bye.
I received your letter this morning and I'm very happy about winning first prize.
It's a great opportunity for me to participate in your Camp California because normally I work a lot and I can't spend money on travel. Moreover, I have to support a big family because I'm married and I have three children.
For the accommodation I would prefer a log cabin because it'll be more comfortable. I know that I would like to sleep in a tent but at this moment I have a little problem with my right leg and it's better for me to sleep in a bed.
I know that I have the chance to do two activities during this . I have to choose painting and  photography therefore. I would prefer surfing or climbing but I have to think of my health.
In your letter you explain  that all accommodation and travel costs are paid for but I need to know if the life on Camp California is expensive or not because I have to bring money. I hope the weather will be good so I suppose I have to bring  clothes.
UNFORTUNATELY, PAT WASN'T VERY GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS....AND WHEN SHE FOUND OUT THAT MARIA WAS GOING OUT WITH TIM (A CLASSMATE), SHE TOLD  EVERYONE SHE MET. WITHIN A FEW DAYS MARIA'S FATHER (WHO IS VERY JEALOUS) HAD HEARD THE RUMOUR. HE ASKED MARIA IF IT WAS TRUE AND SHE COULDN'T LIE. HE GOT VERY ANGRY AND HE DIDN'T ALLOW MARIA TO GO OUT FOR A PERIOD OF TWO WEEKS. MARIA TALKED TO HER FATHER AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM THAT TIM IS A GOOD PERSON BUT HER FATHER SAYS THAT SHE IS TOO YOUNG TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
I am looking forward to my holiday, which begins on the first of July lasting until twenty-first July, so it is possible  to travel at this time. I like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since I have done  military service, therefore I would prefer a tent as my accommodation. My favourite activities are swimming and singing. It is important for my health that I swim an hour a week because I am overweight. I like to sing a song when I am alone. Singing is good for my . So I choose singing and swimming as my activities. I am a beginner at swimming and also at singing.
Can you tell me what clothes I should take with me for which two weeks. What kind of weather do you have at this time of year?
It is not enjoyable to see that the price of food is going higher and higher. My salary is getting lower and lower. When I have enough money the price isn't important, then I can buy a lot of things without considering my money. Despite  having enough money, shopping is not always enjoyable , because I don't know which things I . Also I will buy things which I don't need.
It said in the advertisement that the singers are Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. However, there was a different, unknown actor in that. The show started late, at 20:15, which was very different from '19.30' . There was no discount at all, which was in contrast with 'Discounts Available'. After the show, I wanted to have something in the theatre restaurant and found it was closed for no reason.
The fashion in  clothing  just keeps on changing. Although some may appear again after a few years, different styles are developed.
 at this show there will be the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and even hairstyles. All our class and I would like to see this show.
As I said we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday instead of having some free time. I'm looking forward to receiving a letter from you. Thank you very much.
Of course there will be differences between today's homes and  future ones. I think  houses will grow  from twenty floors up to the sky as more and more people will occupy them.
I hope and I  that the future will bring us  good moments in life where everybody will have a home and  warm, friendly family relationships.
Last week, I went to London, to your theatre to see "Over the rainbow" and I had a disappointing evening.
The problems were: firstly, the famous actors Danny Brook and Tina Truelove weren't there in your  show, I was unhappy to  that there were different actors that evening. Secondly, the 19:30 show only started at 20:15; thirdly, your advertisement said: "Discounts available"; but it wasn't the case. Fourth, the restaurant was closed for renovation and you shouldn't have proposed we go.
As you can see, I'm very disappointed about this evening out and I think it was a waste of time and money. That's why I ask you to give me my money back. I ask you to give me Â£20, back by cheque.
Technology is the future, and the present. For instance, the Internet. The whole world is now connected by it. The Internet is the "new" revolution of  communications and knowledge. The Internet has existed for ten years now, but we only used to use it for army and government purposes. Now, everybody who works in a commercial company uses the Internet every day.
I write you this letter because I want to tell you about my experiences at the festival. I spent two days at the "International Arts Festival" and I have to say that it was a good event but I think some  could be better the next time. For example, on the leaflet it was written that there would be stars and artists from around the world but they were only from six different countries. That was disappointing! Some concert halls were really small so that there was  and not enough room for everyone and you could not enjoy anything! What about plays and films? It was a small ; I hope it will be larger the next time.
Dear Helen Ryan: Thank you for letting me know about my prize trip to Camp California in the USA. Here I will answer all the questions that you asked me, and I will ask you about other things that you didn't mention. I'd like to organize my trip for July because that is when I have vacations, also because it is summertime in the U.S.A. About accommodation at Camp I'd prefer a tent, because it's a new experience for me and I'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure. In my free time I like to play golf and swim, so I think that I'm good at playing golf. I play every Saturday and Sunday and, after that, I usually go to the pool because I love swimming. I think that those are the sports I would like to do at the Camp. Helen, I would like to ask you how much money we have to take to the Camp? What kind of clothing do we have take? Thank you very much for your cooperation. Yours sincerely Teresa Reina
I'm glad to receive your letter. I'm very happy to know that I have won the first prize. It will be great to spend two weeks at Camp California. First of all, I would like to say that the only month available for me to travel is July. I finish my classes on the 25th of June and August is reserved for going with my parents to France. This was scheduled 3 months ago.
Secondly, in the advertisement it said that discounts were available but there was no discount on the tickets I bought. Furthermore, I had planned to have a great dinner with my family in your restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there were on holiday. In addition to this, I have to tell you that it was the most horrible evening I have had  and because of this I want to ask you if you could send me a refund for  part of the money I wasted there. I would be grateful if you could do that.
Nowadays, technology is the most useful tool that human beings have. It affects everyone who lives on this planet and every activity done on it.
I'm writing to you because I'm very disappointed by the bad evening I had there. Actually, I read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.
I'm also annoyed because I had to wait 45 minutes before the play started. I can't accept waiting so long for the result I had. I was in London with some friends (we are students) and no discount was offered or given to us. We had to pay Â£15 each  to see a miserable play.
As you can see, there are some (deliberate?) mistakes in the advertisement you made. We didn't have a "perfect evening out" at all. That's why I'm asking you  to give us our money back.
First of all, there was only one actor that was different from your advertisement. Also, it was certain for me to be able to buy a discount ticket because I am a student. But, it was not possible.
Second, I went to the theatre at exactly seven thirty in the evening. However, the show started 45 minutes later. I wasted too much time  waiting. It was not good for me, because I had only one weeks holiday in London. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed with the word "Staff vacation" on the front door after the show. It was totally different from your leaflet.
For example, a lot of people do not like to go shopping in big stores. It takes hours to buy something. There are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities. You will have to walk miles around the store to find what you want. Yes, there is a big plus with a big store of course. You can find everything in one place, in contrast to the small shops which specialise in one product. And people spend all weekend walking around shopping centres and high streets in  to buy something.
Nowadays technical progress gets close to us, to normal customers. The Internet is one of the solutions to this problem. Without any hassle, sitting in your chair in front of your computer, in a second you can get to  any shop that has an internet site - most of the big companies have one - get all the information about the product, get a cheaper price and buy it.
My favourite hobby is photography and I think I am very good at it. I have been taking photographs since I was 17. I took some lessons and after that I really improved . Besides this, I am very good at playing basketball. I used to play in the high school team.
On the night of the concert, I worked as well.
Thank you for my prize! I have never been to the USA and I should be glad to spend two weeks at Camp California.
For the accommodation I would prefer to have a tent because I am used to  staying on campsites and I love it during summer, !!
Concerning the activities, I have chosen two of them. I enjoy swimming and any time I have the opportunity to swim I go. My second activity is painting because I love art and art history and I think that it is better to do one sport and one  and I do not really want to involve myself in a new activity that I am unfamiliar with during my holidays.
"Shopping is not always enjoyable" "Shopping today!" If you decide , that  means that you need something special for yourself or someone else. You have the money and the time that you want. That's why it should be a great day! Save some money to go  shopping in Paris or Roma and see how  the French or Italian fashion looks on you! And after that you can visit the duty-free shops and buy some cheap souvenirs. Singapoor and many places in Asia are famous for the shopping, and it is really nice to go there with enough money to buy what you always wanted to. But even if shopping  it can be boring sometimes. If you have no money and a friend asks you to go  shopping, it should be boring! And you may become jealous of him and want him to do it quickly! Or you may  get irritable! And you can find that there are too many people in the shops, it is too hot or you cannot get the right size or the right colour or flavour -- - then you get angry! Or you decide not to spend the money  shopping today, but . What is going on??
I am writing to you about your production: 'over the rainbow'. I went to a performance and I am very disappointed. Firstly, your advertisement said the actor would be Danny Brook, but it was not. It was another actor who played very badly. Secondly, the musical should start at 19.30, but we had to wait until 20.15! It was boring that nothing happened for such a long time on the stage. Did you know that you have no discounts on your tickets? I could not believe that. Why do you write things on your advertisement that are not true? And finally, I would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought I would go to 'Theatre restaurant'. But how could I , it was closed!
There are too many negative points for one evening. I am afraid that I want my money back. I hope you do not disappoint me on this point.
'Fashion of the Future'! This is not a taboo subject with me and my friends. We have discussed  it a lot of times. I think it is important and necessary to think about it, because our children will live in the future.
I had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different. I think it is very difficult to change  clothes and  fashion so much again. We have so many kinds of clothes and fashions from our old generations. Maybe, the skirts will be shorter and the colours brighter, the shoes more modern so that you cannot walk in them anymore.
I didn't tell you, but I helped at this concert just by chance. A friend of mine gave up one week before and asked me if I would like to go in his place. I said "yes" and I am sure it was the best decision of my life.
Of course I was very tired at the end of five days because of some stressful situations. However, those days were unforgettable for me.
I would like to travel in July, since I am studying and that is the only month I have on vacation. Fortunately, I have heard that the weather is beautiful in California during that month. I'd rather sleep in a tent because I want to enjoy this wild experience! I will take my sleeping bag with me, just in case.
Wait for a sunny day, take a look at your wardrobe, some money, ask a friend to go with you, and enjoy an exciting shopping trip!
I will be very happy to travel in July because in that month I am going to have my holidays, so I will not have to ask permission from my boss. At the same time, my birthday is in July, so it would be nice to celebrate it there.
You are never going to believe what I did last month. I was walking with my sister in Oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour. We said yes immediately. I nearly shouted with happiness when they told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert. He is my favourite singer.
The concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage, doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there. We were so close to him. I didn't have the chance to talk with him but I don't mind. I will never forget that day. Since then, I and my sister talk about Luis Miguel every day.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow" that has been performed in the Circle Theatre. As I was very anxious to see that show, I planned to go to the theatre on my last holiday, and I am completely disappointed with it.
First of all, I have to say that the advertisement promised something totally different from what I saw there. For example, the actors that were announced as taking part in the show were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, the discounts were not available and, the principal point: it started forty-five minutes late. Then, to complete this terrible night, the restaurant was closed. I wonder if you could explain to me why.
The huge growth of technology has brought lots of good things into my life, like the potential to be informed about everything that is happening around the world with the best image on my cab TV and on my computer. Without leaving my bedroom, I can go anywhere using the Internet. On the other hand, the excess of convenience can lead us, in the future, to a completely "cold" world, because of the distance that can be created between people. Other bad points can be mentioned, like  pollution for example.
About the different activities, we like them all, but If I have to choose two I opt for sailing and tennis. In the summer I'm sailing in races almost every weekend and I have my own sailing clothes. I'm not very good at tennis but I can practise on my trip.
I am writing to inform you about your question. Firstly, I would like to  travel in July, because before then I don't have time to travel. I have to finish my studies.
You could go shopping for some rest to the high street or a department store. Then you could find the cheapest goods and in that case, you probably buy it needlessly. Moreover if you bought something then you could find it is a little bit more expensive than the other shop. Both cases often happen with shopping.
Unfortunately, I've been really disappointed. I'm not keen on liars, Mr Smith, and I think that you've lied to  naive tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different,  pitiful ones. Moreover the show was expected to begin at 19.30 but it was delayed by forty-five minutes. It is a shame! I ought not to talk about the restaurant, which was closed for no apparent reasons
To begin with, I'd like to underline how the importance of technology has increased in a couple of years. With the end of the Second world war and the beginning of economic prosperity, many goods like TVs, washing machines, etc. became cheaper and more available. Nowadays, the Internet and the mobile phone, with the development of satellite communication, seem to take the lead. Do they affect my daily life?
As far as I am concerned, the first way modern technology influences me is through my work: the Internet has become such an incredible tool, I can  research into everything I want, find information for lectures, for example, or exercises. The internet is really the widest source of knowledge.
You have sent me a letter about the competition and the first prize I have won. You asked me for some further information.
First, I'd like to travel in July at any time from the first to the 30th because of my vacation period. I'd rather have a few days at the beginning of July to prepare myself.
This book remains one of the best in American literature . It is classed as one of the ten books that should be in your own library. But it is also the most famous short story by Ernest Hemingway. Based on a very simple story, the story of an old man fishing, it is a deep reflection on age.
Before answering your letter (which I have just received) about the prize for the competition I recently won, I'd like to say  thank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA. It is just a dream come true!
I have recently spent a week's holiday in London, and I have just visited your theatre to see a musical show and I would like to complain about a couple of things.
Pat and I knew each other very well, because we are neighbours, so since we've met, Pat and I have always got on very well. We always go to the same school, and he often makes more friends than I do, and every time he  introduces me to them. Even though Pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone, even himself.
Thirdly, there was no discount on my ticket and the theatre restaurant was closed because of being repaired.
With my friend Miko I looked for a little weekend job and one evening we met a guy who wanted to sell  drinks at the pop concert and so we told him that we agreed to help him at the bar.
It was a wonderful weekend: we were opposite  the singers and we saw every concert without buying any tickets ! (We were part of the staff of the concert.)
At the end we had 1200 in profit and each of us took 400 for himself
I felt very upset about  your advertisement was totally different from  the musical show. Firstly, I could not buy a discount ticket as you mentioned. Secondly, the show started at 20:15  instead of 19:30 . Thirdly, the theatre restaurant was  closed. But the worst thing is the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. It was really a letdown!!
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets.  Pat is very smart and intelligent. She likes to talk to other people. She has an open mind. So, she has got many friends.
Lily was one of her best friends for three years. She enjoyed sharing everything with Pat, whatever  it was. Nick was Lily's husband. Her husband had been fired the previous year. Lily felt very nervous about their financial problems and their future as they wanted to have a baby. She told  Pat about what had happened in her family and that she was worried. Of course, she knew Nick didn't like her to tell other people  about his private . She told  Pat that she didn't want any other people to know about it except her. Pat also promised not to tell other people.
But at  a  party, their friends wanted to show their concern, and they went to ask about Nick and give him their sympathy. This made Nick very embarrassed and he felt hurt. Finally, they got separated.
. I would like to travel only in July because I would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter. I would like to travel in July to be sure it would not rain during the trip, which would be annoying?! And when the sun is shining you are relaxed and you feel good.
. From the list below, the two activities I will choose are tennis and sailing. Tennis because I play tennis and I am classed 15-5. I like tennis very much because it is  and physical sport. And you need a strategy to win the match. It is nice to play tennis outside on the court when the weather is hot. But you can't play if there is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
I would like to tell you that I was really disappointed with my evening  at your theatre. At first when I came I hoped to see Danny Brook on the stage, but there was a totally different actor. As it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but I had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because according to the programme it started at 20.15, but that is not the end of the story; in your advertisement it is clearly said that you have discounts available on tickets. That was not true! I was still not very disappointed, because I hoped that I would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant, which I could have according to your advertisement, but what I did not realise, it was closed, because the chef was in  hospital.
Every day we keep in touch via technology. We have microwaves that help us to make our meals quickly, we have hairdryers to dry our hair in 15 minutes, we have different things that make our lives easier.
To answer your questions, I would like to tell you that I can only travel in July, because I will be studying for the Cambridge exam till 1 July.
And would it be possible to do swimming and surfing. I am very good at swimming. I have been doing it for as long as I can remember. At surfing I am not good at all. I have been dreaming about this activity since I was 10 years old.
I would like to know  how many people will stay with me in the tent, and do I have  to take with me any special clothes for  surfing.
I would like to travel in July because I am a student so I only have holidays in this part of the year.
The activities that I want to do at the camp are Basketball and Surfing. Basketball is the sport that I really like because I am very tall and I used to play it very well. On the other hand I know almost nothing about surfing but I would like to learn and to do the sport because I think it is cool.
There are people that love going  shopping. They live, work and only think about it. They are addicted to buying things. Some doctors say that shopping without control is a disease and I agree with them because I have a friend who is a compulsive shopper. He can't stop buying things.  He spends all his money buying things that he sometimes doesn't use. I think this is one bad side of shopping and many people have this problem.
I can only travel in July because I have already booked and fully paid for a holiday , from 25th  July till the end of August. If you can arrange my departure time for 1st of July it would be convenient for me.
I want to do these two activities while I am at the camp: sailing and photography. I have great experience of sailing. I used to work for a sailing company in Turkey. And I have  a certificate in using a radio (VHF). I have knowledge of navigation, engine , ropes and knots, and  sails as well.
I like shopping but I had a bad experience on a recent shopping trip. I went out to get some shopping and to get some ideas about new  computers and  products. First of all, I went to a local shop but they didn't have a big enough selection of products.
Do I have to bring some cash with me? Do you think traveller's cheques would be more safe? I would also like to get some information about the weather. What is it like in July over there?
The activities I would like to do most are climbing and surfing. In my free time I have climbed a lot of mountains in the surrounding area so I can say that I am quite good at climbing. But I have never 'surfed' in my life, so that is an activity I have to .
Dear Sir Brown, I'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show that I saw. I didn't have a good time! Firstly, Danny Brook didn't act. There was another actor, James Kee, but I didn't like him! I had gone to the theatre to see Danny Brook but he wasn't there. In addition to that, the show didn't start at 20.15; so it ended at 23.45 and I couldn't go to a meeting. I'm very disappointed by all these problems! Your theatre is very disorganized! The ticket's price was Â£20 and there weren't any discounts! After the show, I wanted to eat something, but the theatre restaurant was closed because the chef was in Italy for a special course. I didn't have  great fun, so I ask for that money back. Yours faithfully
But the situation wasn't simple, so Hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousin. They agreed that Karla's love was only a dream. So they went to talk with her about the situation, but when she knew that they knew her feelings for Mr. Beek, she decided not to tell Pat anything ever.
But to add to this I had to join a long queue to get a full-price ticket when  I had brought my student card for the purpose of getting the discount which had been advertised but didn't in fact exist.
The show which was to start at 19.30 only began at 20.15 and therefore I and my friends weren't able to find a restaurant when we had to because the theatre restaurant was closed for sanitary reasons.
I would like to have my two weeks with you in July, as it will be during my summer holiday. In addition to that, it is said to be the best season there. I will join in with the swimming group and the photography group. Both of them are my hobbies. I have won some prizes in my school competitions in them. Therefore, I am quite confident about them.
Last week I bought some tickets to the musical show "Over the Rainbow", thinking that I would have a perfect evening, as its advertisement promises us.
To complete my sadness, the main actor was replaced by another one who I'd never heard anything about, and did not have the same talent that the one shown on the advertisement has.
I'm writing to you to complain about this show, and to ask for my money back. It isn't fair not returning the money to a person who bought tickets to watch a show that was supposed to be great, but actually was a disgrace.
So, it's very important to be a person who can keep secrets, even your own secrets, or a friend's one. One of the most beautiful things in the world is  true and loyal friendship. Then, we have to be the best secret keepers  possible, or we will end up like Ali and Pat.
I went to London to see this musical but I was absolutely disappointed by the show. I got to the theatre at 18:30 because I wanted to have a drink before I went to the hall so I got there earlier. The show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15. It was about fourty five minutes later than the original starting time. I was just a bit upset but I wasn't that upset  at that time. The thing which made me really upset was the actor. The actor should have been Danny Brook but it was another man who I haven't seen before. I liked Danny Brook so much and I was expecting to see him but you didn't even mention  that that actor was going to be changed to another man. This thing shouldn't have happened.
My school's rules aren't strict. We are allowed to do a lot of things. For example, we can wear any clothes and shoes - whatever we want. And it doesn't matter if we enter the classroom at any time we want. Of course we can go out of the classroom at any time.
But some schools in my country don't allow a lot of things. One of the rules at my friend's school is you are not allowed to drink or eat anything during a class. And the students have to wear  uniforms, so they can't choose their clothes.
Also, there is one strict rule at my home. It is that I have to come back to my house by 11 o'clock at night. I think it's a stupid rule!
One day Maria and her mother returned home and found a letter. All her father's things were missing. They could not believe their eyes. They read the letter and slowly went into the kitchen. Maria had bought his favourite food and she threw it  into the bin. How could he have done it to them? They had been so happy for 15 years. They had gone everywhere together and laughed a lot. Now everything was over. She went to school, but she could not follow the lessons as easily as she used to. So she decided to tell Pat, her lovely Pat. She was so understanding.
Secondly, according to the advertisement, the show should have started at 19:30, but it started at 20:15. Moreover, the theatre restaurant was closed for  maintenance. You should have let us have that information in advance.
In addition, I can go to Britain by plane to see her. Before the plane was invented, I suppose it might have taken several months to visit Britain by ship. At present, it takes just 12 hours by plane.
I am writing to you to thank you  for the prize you're giving me. This is the first time in my life that I won anything like that. When I received your letter, I could not believe it.
I am writing in reply to your letter. I am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
About the information that you need, I must tell you that I will be able to travel only in July because I have got a new job and I can't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months I will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in these months.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a tent because it is more appropriate to a camp. And regarding the activities, I must choose Photography and Painting because I am not very good at sports and I think I do well at these things.
Thank you for organising the programme for the trip to London. There are a lot of activities that all of my classmates are interested in and they are especially looking forward to sightseeing by bus and visiting the National Art Gallery. However, I am writing to suggest a special activity while we are in London.
To sum up, nobody wants their private life to be revealed in public. Therefore, even famous people need their own life apart from the media.
It's believed that English schools look different and have different rules to Polish schools but maybe we might find something in common.
School is supposed to be our second home but it's not. We work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing.
Thank you for the letter. I was very pleased when I knew that I had won the first prize. I would like to go there only in July, please, because I have a holiday in July. For accommodation I would  prefer log cabins because they are more comfortable than tents. And I don't have to worry about the weather. For two activities, regarding the first one, can I do Tennis, please, because I'm very good at tennis. I used to play a lot when I was a student. Regarding the second one, can I do Photography, please, because this is my hobby. And my dad just bought me a new camera. So this will be my first chance  to use it.
The first time, when I saw the advertisement in the newspaper, I really . I wanted to see the play as quickly as possible. .
I am writing this letter in order to express my disappointment with your theatre.
In the advertisement that I received, it was written that the show would start at 19:30 but I kept waiting for it to start for half an hour. And there were no discounts available either, unlike what was written in the same advertisement.
I am writing to you about my complaints  about the musical show at your theatre that I watched a week ago, during my stay in London.
That evening, the problems started with the tickets... Unlike what was stated in the advertisement that was published in the Guardian, there were no discounts available, although I had an International Student's Identity Card.
Secondly, the show started after a delay of 45 minutes, and because of this all my arrangements for that night were delayed. Another problem was the male actor : the well-known and talented actor mentioned in the advertisement was replaced by another one, who was really very disappointing and after the performance, I visited the theatre restaurant, which was supposed to be open and available for meals after the show, but it was closed.
In my opinion the clothes of the world, in a century's time, will be styled in a Japanese way: minimalist and naturalist. Throughout  history, we have observed that people get rid of everything that is not natural, such as corsets and in the future belts and ties might be "out".
First, I would like to travel during July. This is because my college will finish at the end of June and I am going to go back to Japan in August. Second, I prefer to stay in a log cabin. I usually stay in a tent during camping. Actually, I don't like tents so much. Therefore, I am interested in staying in a log cabin. Third, I chose painting and golf as activities. I learned painting when I was a school student. In particular, I like water painting. Also, I belonged to a golf club when I went to university in Japan.
I am very keen on photography so I definitely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp. The other thing I'd love to do is sailing. I have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore I simply love water sports and their challenges.
Thank you for the letter you have sent recently. It was a surprise to learn that I won the first prize. The reason I am really writing, however, is to give you some details about my trip to California.
In order to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the city, the County Council organised an open air concert. It was a summer night and all the citizens, as well as tourists, had the opportunity to attend. The pop band "Five" arrived in town and needed people to help with not only the organisation but also with building the stages and  sound. I knew some help was needed so I decided to speak to the manager. I couldn't believe it when he said: "O.K., if you want to help, here is a list of what you can do." My job was to leave some leaflets in shops, restaurants and on the streets.
I thought about you while reading the book because I remembered you have booked a place on a Detective course. I'm sure you'll find this book an interesting object of study. Agatha Christie's stories are simple, but very well written, and, as I told you, very coherent. It's stimulating to read them.
One of the stories will be read on the radio next week. I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are many challenges in your new career.
I would like to congratulate you on the excellent programme that you have prepared. I think that it is such a good programme, especially because the places that we visit, like the Science Museum, are very interesting.
In my opinion, the home of the future will be very similar to the homes that we have today. I think that it will have a similar structure but it will include some new technological advantages like having all the house controlled by a computer so that, for example, we can turn on the lights in the bedroom just by pressing a button while we are watching the TV sitting on the sofa.
Although many people think that the home of the future will be something like a UFO, in my opinion the changes won't be very great, they will probably consist of making the housework easier. The clearest example is to compare a house from the beginning of the 20th century with our houses. Both are very similar but now we have new technologies. On balance then, I think that the houses that we  see in films won't really exist.
Thank you very much for the prize. I am writing this letter to inform you that I have received your letters and I am going on the trip.
I would like to go on the trip in July because my school, which is Berkeley International School, is going to arrange the end of term break both for staff and students. The other reason is, I think in July the weather is not so cold. The weather conditions will be suitable for camping. I prefer to stay in tents rather than log cabin because sleeping in a tent makes me more comfortable and I can get closer to  nature. Every night I would like to go out of the small tent into the nice environment outside the tent. Also, staying in a tent is more comfortable. I'll have to be careful about insects so I've bought so many insect repellants. I can choose to do 2 activities so I would like to play tennis and go swimming. When I was in the fourth form, I got the first prize in a swimming competition and third prize in tennis. I was a bit disappointed with the result because I was expected to win the first prize or second prize.
I had to help them behind the stage, while they were getting dressed. I had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly. Although the work was not hard, I gained a lot of experience. They gave me their autographs and when the concert started, they told me to come up on the stage and dance with them. I was really embarrassed because I had to dance in front of a lot of people but that was the very best experience I have ever had. I  really enjoyed  the concert. The thing that I particularly liked about the concert was I got a free ticket from Westlife to go to the A1 concert, which is another well-known band. I really want to have that experience again.
I am writing to you in connection with your programme for spending three days in London. I would like to inform you about The London Fashion and Leisure show on Tuesday 14th March between 10.00 - 19.00. I would be grateful if you could include this show in your programme.
In my opinion, I think you should have this event in the afternoon instead of going  shopping and move the shopping slot to the afternoon on Wednesday.
I think I would like to travel only in July because I'll have just finished my course at that time, and I can have a short holiday . It will be very nice for me.
Another thing is when you shop on a busy street,  like Oxford St in London, a lot of thieves are there. They will steal your money. That's so dangerous.
When I saw your advertisement in yesterday's newspaper, I thought that I would have a perfect evening as you wrote in your advertisement. But now I am thinking that it was a waste of time.
Yesterday Larry suggested going to the cinema after school. This was the most wonderful suggestion I have ever had. Going to the cinema with the boy I love. It sounded really good. Of course I accepted immediately. I was  walking in the clouds for the whole day until I saw Pat running towards me. I suddenly remembered that I had promised Pat that I would help her with her history homework. She came up to me and said "Ready for this evening? Don't forget to bring your history books." She was very nervous because she was about to fail. I told her that I wanted to tell her something. Then I explained what had happened that morning. She was going to cry. "I see. You are choosing Larry, but I thought that I was your best friend." After hearing this, I told her that I am deeply in love with Larry. I told her not to tell anyone this. She said OK angrily.
After school Larry and I went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us. Larry told me that she is his girlfriend and then I told them I had to go home. When they asked me the reason I told them that I promised my Mom to stay in with her. They said OK and I went home. When I closed my bedroom door I burst into tears. I don't know how long I cried...
Next morning I went to school again. Everyone at the school knew about my love for Larry including him. Pat was the only person who had known about it.
Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very surprised to win this prize. About the information, I would like to travel in July because it's only the month when I have a vacation. It's very difficult to change it. About the accommodation at Camp California, I would prefer tents because I like the countryside and I like to listen to the birds. At the camp I would like to play tennis and golf. My level in these two activities is medium. I never  them both. I would like to ask you some questions.
In particular, I would have to name the great opportunity you offer to us with the visit to the National Art Gallery which is one of the most important art galleries in the world.
Based on this I would like to suggest minor changes to the fabulous Programme you have offered. These changes will not affect the contents of the programme itself.
The task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. There was nothing to lose.
I am writing to confirm that we have received your programme for our class for the three days of our stay in London and would like to thank you.
I am amazed about the prize in your competition. I am looking forward to going to Camp California in the USA and I am writing to give you further information.
Another point is that now you don't need to go out  shopping. You can buy a lot of products over the Internet.
I'm writing to you in order to complain about this show. The problems started when we arrived at the Theatre: my 6-year-old son had to pay the full price. Then, even if we could enter  the theatre, the show didn't start before 20:15, which is 45 minutes later than expected. Indeed, we are still waiting for Danny Brook who was not in the play. And last, at the end of the performance, we would have liked to have a drink in the theatre Restaurant, but it was already closed due to the poor attendance.
You asked me when I would like to travel? I would like to travel only in July because in August I must go to my grandmother's and help  her to gather a harvest of fruit. I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. And with the tent I can go to another place in the camp. When it rains it is not comfortable, but I like it. I want to do  activities like basketball, because I think it is a teenager's game. And I like painting because I like to paint  nature, sea, mountains. I often go to  exhibitions of paintings of modern artists. But I like different styles of art. I think I'll enjoy this trip.
I'm really looking forward to your answers. And I hope to see you soon. Bye
I am very happy to have won a two-week trip to Camp California, but for me it is only possible to travel in July because it is the only time when I can get holidays from work. Therefore, it is essential that you take account of my availability when booking the trip.
I have just seen the letter this morning and I am very happy about winning the competition. I believe I have the appropriate qualifications to stay two weeks at camp California. It would be wonderful to see you as soon as possible.
Secondly, I am very keen on sports, specially  sailing and swimming. Anyway I am working hard at sailing for the world cup.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Do you remember the computer course that we took together. It was very useful to classify each person at the concert. So keep in touch.
I will definitely go to the festival next year, too. To make it more enjoyable, I would be grateful if you could  my comments about it.
To be honest, the only suitable time for me to travel is in July because my session at the University will have finished only at the end of June.
A lot of women would never agree with me and almost all the men in the world would never believe that in my opinion shopping is really not always enjoyable.
But sometimes I have to forget my opinion and spend all the day with my mother looking through a huge department-store.
Firstly, you did not tell the truth about the lead. The advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny Brook. Unfortunately there was someone else - an actor who I do not like and if I had known that he was going to be there I would not have gone to see him.
In fact, modern technology was already very popular and commonly used when I was born, so I cannot say that it changed my life suddenly. But I am also sure that my life would be different without it. All these products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day. For example, I am woken up by my electronic alarm-clock, then I go to the bathroom and there is hot and cold water. Next I eat my breakfast and listen to the radio. All these things are the results of  technology.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because I have a lot of work in my company at the moment, so my boss said I can have my holiday only in July.
Last, I have no experience of travelling abroad. Therefore I'd like to know about the weather in California in July. Which clothes should I take? Maybe there are some occasions when I have to pay for myself. As mentioned above, please  to give me more information, and if you'd like to know more, please telephone me for further discussion.
It is a largish city and has a population of over eight million. I went to school there for twelve years. Many people say: "When you have a son, send him to Seoul to get a job and to have the chance of the best opportunity. There are all kinds of facilities which you can imagine.
There are a lot of folk stories from around the world and there are a lot of folk stories in Estonia. I would like to tell you one of them. This story is about a man and his three sons. This story happened a long time ago. The man was old and his sons were young.
I would like to travel in July because I will be on my winter holidays, so I will not miss classes at school. I would really prefer to stay in a tent because I love sleeping outdoors and listening to the noises from outside.
I was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when I was there I saw  another star that was completely different from  your brochure. To make the matter worse, I had travelled to London to see this famous star but I didn't see any shows with him. It makes me a bit angry.
According to your brochure, the show would start at 19.30 p.m. but it started at 20.15 p.m. I wanted to sleep and it was very annoying. More than that, when I bought the ticket I didn't get any discount. I had to pay full price.
One day, I fell in love with my closest friend. I went out with him sometimes and we were happy. My boyfriend was very handsome, clever and very polite. We were studying in the same class at school and he also knew Pat as well. Personally, I wanted to keep it secret because I was afraid that we might split up. And I would like to make sure that he  really loved me. My boyfriend told me that he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came.
To be honest, I wanted to share this feeling with someone else but I needed to keep it very secret. I felt unhappy sometimes.
I felt very angry with Pat and I shouldn't have told her about my boyfriend. I felt regret but it was too late. It wasn't a secret anymore now.
As I may choose the two activities I would like to do during my stay at the Camp from the list given in your letter, I choose singing and photography. I have been taking singing lessons since I was ten years old so I am pretty good at it. On the other hand, I am a beginner at photography skills.
One of the activities I would prefer to do is Climbing. I haven't done a lot of it but I've always found it interesting and I think this would be a good opportunity to become better at it. The other activity I would like to do is tennis, I'm quite good at it and I have been playing for four years.
Hello girl, how are you doing these days? I have been great, especially last weekend at the Backstreet Boys concert. It was so exciting.
They were giving two concerts, one on Friday and the other one on Saturday. They invited me to go on Friday. This is what happened: when I arrived they told me that I was helping  backstage with the scenery; then the group arrived, we chat for like 15 minutes, then they had to go on stage. Here is where the good part starts, I was doing the curtains (opening and closing) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him. My heart started beating very hard. The next second I was in front of more than 2 thousand people dancing with The Backstreet Boys. I had a great time that day.
I would like to travel in July because this is the only month off given to me by my employer. I would prefer to have a log cabin because I cannot sleep in a tent (it is too hot and the floor is too hard for my back). Concerning the two activities I have to choose, I would prefer to swim and play tennis (I have a good level of proficiency in each sport).
Third, you need to know which sport I want to to do. I would choose photography and tennis. In photography, I am just a novice, nevertheless I have got a suitable camera... (I guess that you shouldn't borrow one!) Regarding tennis, I have played for eight years and I used to enter  competitions.
I have received your letter about the competition 'two weeks at Camp California' - I am very glad to know that I have won the first prize! In the following you can find, I hope, all the information you need to complete the enrolment procedure. I would like to travel only in July because, as you already know, at the moment I am following a doctoral course at  Cornell University: the school is closed in July and so, in that period, I am available for the camp. If possible, the type of accommodation I prefer is a tent. There are two main reasons for this choice: I am very keen on camping in high mountains and hills and I am very skilled in all the related activities: putting up the tent, cooking  and so on. Furthermore I have several personal objects that play a fundamental role in the daily life of the camp (the tent, the sleeping bag and so on.). Among the proposed activities, I prefer swimming and singing. Indeed, I like  water sports and I am quite a good guitarist and singer. Some questions: what is the average temperature at the camp in July? What are the best clothes to wear at the camp? How much money will I need at the camp?
I will be very glad to participate in your camp!
I do not know if it is possible to make any changes to this plan but we saw an ad in "Time Out" magazine last week about a fashion show which we would like to see. The show's date is very convenient - March 14 -, and it is on in the Central Exhibition Hall so I do not think it would be a problem to get there.
Briefly, we would be happy if we could see this show instead of the Science Museum. We can find another time to go to the Science Museum on any other day, but this show is just on this Tuesday. Also, it's free for students. I hope it won't cause a problem to change the programme. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
My name is Marcia Fomalar, I am writing to let you know how disappointed I felt when I went to the musical  at the London theatre.
I thought we could put on a show at this special party so I talked to Pat, my best friend, to see if she could help me as she works in the production of T.V. programmes. She loved the idea and said she had various shows so I could decide which would be the most suitable. I told her to call me .
I am writing to reply to your letter  about the holiday at Camp California in the U.SA which is the first prize in the competition which I fortunately won last month.
About the activities that I have to choose, I have to say that it is quite difficult for me because I really like sports, but I think the best option is swimming because I have been doing it for 5 years so I want to keep at it. The other activity that I chose is painting. I am not as good as I want, nevertheless I think I can improve my skills during this course.
2 - They also think that through filming some of the lessons that they usually have, known as "one-to-one" lessons, people who see this video will become interested in knowing more about the school, because  few English schools have this sort of class.
I have just received your letter and I am really looking forward to going on this trip. Here is some information you asked for and also a few questions.
I'm writing this letter to explain the reasons for our disappointment with that evening.
When the show had finished we decided to go for a snack in the theatre restaurant and it was closed without anyone giving any reason .
With reference to our trip to London, on behalf of all of us, the English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special attention in  organising a good programme to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London.
We have been very excited about this and coincidentally we have found another option to add to our programme, certainly if you agree with it. We thought that The London Fashion and Leisure Show would be a great opportunity to give us more information about the main transformations  nowadays in England concerning fashion, leisure, sports and lifestyle.
However, it is your decision  to change our programme a little bit. We would suggest just not going shopping on Tuesday afternoon, and everything else could stay the same. We are really satisfied with the sightseeing by bus, and with going to the National Gallery, but the whole class would like to go to The London Fashion Show and it will be free.
Unfortunately, I've got a brother who likes to live in a dangerous and  way and I don't know how, but he was able to persuade me to go with him to get some drugs, on my 25th birthday. I was at home putting my makeup on before going to a restaurant with my friends and, suddenly, he rang the bell. He was so tense with a gun in his hands and I could no longer speak. He took me out with him.
I had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he forced me to buy cocaine using my cheques. I didn't want to, because I've never approved of his drug dealing, but I couldn't do it differently.
The first problem concerned the main actor in the show. Although it was written in the show's advertisement that the main actor was Danny Brook, it, unfortunately, was not him.
It was also written in the show's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets. However, there were not any.
I am writing to you about an incident that occurred at the musical  which was put on at your theatre during my week's holiday in London.
Another thing is that there was not any discount available so we spent a lot of money on  a bad show.
DANNY BROOK is one of my favourite actors so I decided to buy a ticket even though I had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also . However, when I got to the theatre, you not only didn't have any discounts but also had to apologize to us for the delay in starting the musical. In addition a different actor appeared on the stage and I couldn't have dinner after the musical because the restaurant was closed. It made me so disappointed and angry.
I was looking forward to taking advantage of the discounts available, but when I came to buy my ticket I was told there were no discounts available.
Secondly, the well-known star Danny Brook wasn't there, but a different actor and I had never heard of him. From my point of view I think he was such a very bad actor that it would be impossible to find another with the same characteristics.
After the show I went to visit the restaurant as it is supposed to be very famous and apart from that I wanted to have a drink. In the end I had to go home as it was closed because the coffee pot did not work. What nonsense!
I am writing to you about the trip to London.
The next thing - I would prefer to spend all the nights in a tent, so I can move it to the place that will suit me best.  I like to wake up with a view of mountains, which reminds me of my 5 years' experience of climbing.
Also I enjoy walking and photography. I have filled two albums with birds and flowers .
If you were to ask me, I prefer my friends to do all my shopping for me, because I am aware of the big queues at the checkout, crowds of people, noise... And of course not all shops have good air conditioning.
After reading your advertisement. I went to your theatre to see 'Over the rainbow' last night. I was excited to see it. But everything was terrible and different to your advertisement. First of all the actor was different. So I was disappointed. I had wanted to see Danny Brook in the show. The movie started 20.15 not 19.30. You wrote 'discounts available' but they didn't offer any discount. After the show, I couldn't have my dinner in your theatre restaurant. The restaurant was closed because of being repaired.
I have a lot of housework to do from early morning until late evening. I always use many electric appliances; washing machine, dish-washer, vacuum cleaner, blender, juicer, fridge. I think I can have my spare time thanks to these things. For example if I don't have a washing machine, I would have to wash all the clothes myself. Then it takes about 1 hour or one and a half to wash. while the washing machine is whirring, I can have my time. So I can read my book or do another thing. Also I can't imagine my life without a car. It would be terrible. Now I can't live without them.
It will be interesting to show how the lessons are organized, showing that we are never doing just one activity during the class. We should speak about our library, that it is well furnished with many books, tapes and videos.
I went to the Circle Theatre to see a musical show called "Over the Rainbow", and I was very disappointed by it.
 It was not such a perfect evening out. I would instead say that it was a very disappointing evening, and I would like to have my money back as soon as possible or we will meet in court!
Every day when I get up I check if there are any messages left for me like e-mail or SMS on my mobile phone. They are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive.
Firstly I would like to thank you for the two weeks that I am going to spend at  Camp California
Secondly, I will be able to travel in July because I am a manager so I cannot travel another time. Now I am going to answer a few questions: I think it is better for me to stay in a log cabin because I have terrible backaches so I cannot sleep on the floor. I would like to sing and take photographs. I've done a course in photography and I think that I am very good at it. On the other hand, I cannot sing very well but I would like to do this activity there.
A long time ago, when I started working, I received my first paycheque and went to a shopping center to spend my money on my credit card. I bought everything I wanted.
That's when she showed me my wallet and said she had found it on the seat at the  at the shopping center that I went to that day!
You may be surprised to receive a letter from us. All the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for three days. This trip would give us the chance to see London and to improve our English . We all like the daily programme for the three days. In the morning, we will have the chance to see some of the sights of London by bus, for example, the Science Museum or the National Art Gallery.
It is also normally true that the journalists are after them. They want to get from them all the details of their life, especially regarding their private life. Who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, these are questions that most journalists are interested in.
But what kind of life is it when you can't even go to a restaurant because you are afraid of the journalists who will be waiting outside for you? It is sometimes a real fight who will take the first picture of a film star or a politician. Famous people also deserve to have a private life. It is a right that everybody among us has. That fact should be respected by the journalists. It is normal when you are a star that everybody wants to know all about you. We shouldn't forget that for this reason the stars want to keep their private life away from the media!
I think nobody has forgotten where the curiosity of the journalists leads. For example, there was the hunting of Princess Diana and her friend. I hope that they will be punished for what they did!
Regarding accommodation I would prefer a tent, as I love nature and I like going camping a lot.
Regarding the two activities I have to choose I will take surfing and basketball. I know very little about surfing, it is almost something new for me. I have only done it once. But, on the other hand, I am a good basketball player, and I play  three or four times a week as I play in the University team.
Hi! How are you? How are you doing at school? I have a terrible cold but I feel OK anyway. I got it two weeks ago at a concert, but although I've been to the doctor, I can't get over it !
It was a marvellous experience. I really enjoyed working with such a nice team, they were really kind to me. And, as if that wasn't enough, I was doing what I love! It's something I will never forget.
I would be very grateful, if you gave me the possibility of singing. I've always wanted to learn to sing professionally, but I've never had an opportunity. I'm very keen on swimming, too. Normally, I live by the seaside and I couldn't live without this sport. Last year I was even champion of my school in crawl for one hundred meters. 
TO ANSWER  ANOTHER OF YOUR QUESTIONS, I'D PREFER TO HAVE  A LOG CABIN, BECAUSE OF MY BACK PROBLEM, WHICH WON'T LET ME SLEEP ON THE GROUND (OR IN A SLEEPING BAG).
SO,  IF  POSSIBLE, I WAS INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUING MY ROUTINE THERE.
SO, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A "REALLY SPLENDID SCIENCE FICTION BOOK" I WILL RECOMMEND YOU TO READ "A WINDOW.." AND I'M SURE THAT WHEN YOU FINISH READING IT YOU WILL WANT TO READ IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN...!
First I would like to answer your questions. I am only available in July. Is that okay for you? This is because the only time I can take a holiday is July. I would prefer log cabins. I think they are more comfortable and safer than tents.
Regarding the two activities, I choose swimming and painting. I choose swimming because I am very good at swimming and I like it very much. I took swimming lessons for four years. And the reason I choose painting is it's very exciting for me. I am not very good at this  but I will improve my painting.
I am a student in the FCE class and I am writing to you on behalf of my class to thank you for the programme for the three-day trip to London that you have prepared for us.
Last week some students in our class saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will be on Tuesday the 14th of March.
For example, all shops are too busy to enjoy shopping in at weekends. Sometimes customers' trolleys run into each other and they have to wait ages to go through check-ins. What's worse, there is usually a traffic jam around or along roads to a big supermarket and a shopping mall. And if an accident takes place on the roads, it can be a nightmare. So I prefer shopping on weekdays unless I am busy or have an appointment.
However, people can't have a good time even on weekdays while shopping. Shopping gets them tired as they have to walk for a long time to find the things they want to get. In addition, they can get angry with a shop assistant because of bad service.
I am writing to express my disappointment with the play "over the rainbow", which is showing at the Circle Theatre.
First of all, the advertisement for the show announced Mr. Danny Brook as the principal actor. Surprisingly, he never appeared on the stage during the play. Therefore, the theatre or the company is lying. Secondly, the show started one hour and fifteen minutes late. We arrived at the theatre on time and we had to wait all that time until the show began. Finally, when I asked about the discounts, an aggressive employee refused to answer me. He stayed looking at me and laughing. It was incredible. The evening was a horrible surprise, completely different from what was promised in the advertisement.
"Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets." I knew that but I would prefer to trust her so I told her everything about Lynne Harter, our new classmate at school. However, I have to admit that I told her my own opinion. Well, that was the beginning of my tragedy. So, I told Pat that Lynne was ugly, fat like a cow, and extremely aggressive. But I couldn't shut my mouth. I continued: "You can't believe it, Pat, she wears trousers like a man and green flowery blouses." Of course, my friend and I were laughing for half an hour. Two days later, when Pat came back to my school,  she met Mr Harter, our head teacher, she told him everything about Ann1. At precisely that moment I realized that I had forgotten to tell her that Ann was Mr Harter's niece. I know it's my fault. But, well, the unhappiness started with Pat and my revealed secrets.
And sometimes the cashpoint machines don't work, or they don't accept your card or  you have exceeded the limit on your credit card.
To answer your questions, I'd like to travel only in July, as it is the only time when I can take my holidays.
When I was a child, I was very good at basketball, one of the best in my class even. I like playing in a team and deciding quickly what to do next. These  are why I'd also like to go sailing. Sailing means an ever renewed adventure as you cannot control the atmospheric conditions. Please, don't forget to tell me how much money I need.
The first idea about shopping is that buying something will be a pleasure for the buyer and, for that reason, will be enjoyable.
So, you run to the bank but have to wait in the queue. There is only one minute left! It's your turn and you  as quickly as possible. You run back to the shop and get your item. But now, you are very tired and need a good rest!
Regarding accommodation in tents or log cabins, I would enjoy much more being in a tent as I believe that is the right type of accommodation for going camping.
Men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite pastime. However, that impression is not always true.
I want you to know what an extraordinary time I had with my friends at the festival. Your work was brilliant because you brought stars and artists from around the world for only that reasonably priced ticket we bought for the whole weekend. The festival was very well organised with a lot of alternatives like concerts and dance shows. In my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. You have to consider booking a bigger one for  next year because these kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people. In conclusion, I wanted to say thanks for such a special weekend.
I am writing to you because I am really disappointed about "Over the Rainbow" which I saw the other day during my stay in London which your company organized. I put off everything to watch this performance but everything that was written in your advertisement wasn't true at all. In your advertisement it said the show would start at 19:30 but it began at 20:15. I can understand that a musical show has to be prepared and it takes time. Even so, I can't understand why the actors of this play Danny Brook and Tina Truelove didn't appear in the play and there was another actor instead of Danny Brook. After all this, I wanted to make my evening pleasant but to my surprise the theatre restaurant was closed because of some sanitary problems. I explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and I want you to refund my money and send  me an apology for what happened there.
When I have a headache I swallow pills, made by technology. I think everything around us is thanks to technology but we can't forget that these things were made by us. The human being.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages but the most important thing is how we use it. If we create guns to protect our homes, others will use them to burgle our homes, and take advantage of the defenceless people. However, the technology never stops, we always search for new things because we are made to compete, discover, think of things which we don't know.
Plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available. In fact, no discount was given to me, though I am a student and as a student I was entitled to get a discount but I paid Â£20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
Finally, I think that this evening was very far from being perfect, and I ask you for my money, which I spent on this horrible evening in your theatre, back.
The Internet is a good way of meeting people that are far from us, we can also inform ourselves about what is happening in the world, or search for a special hobby to get a quick result.
I went to your annual international arts festival. I really enjoyed it, although I feel it could have been better. But firstly, I want to congratulate you on organizing such a huge festival, people need this kind of event. Secondly, I would like to make some remarks about your festival so that you can improve it. As it said so in your advertisement, artists should have come from around the world but only six countries were represented. I was quite disappointed. However the concerts were great, but unfortunately, some concert halls were too small and it was as hot as an oven inside.
I joined  an expedition  in order to explore the Rocky Mountains. We planned a route. We arrived at the  in the morning and started to walk.
I met Pat when we were children. We went to the same school and were in the same class. I liked a boy who was in the same class. I told her that and she assured me that she wouldn't say anything to him. When we finished at our primary school we went to the same secondary school too, but we were in different classes. We went out every weekend. And when we finished at the secondary school, I decided go to a foreign University. I spent five years there, although I came back every summer and we continued going out as we had done before. When I finished I returned to my city to find a job.
To make things worse, the restaurant was closed. The manager said it was closed because they had not been informed that there would be a show on that date.
However, the clothes will not be like those teenagers  wear nowadays to go to "raves". They will be more beautiful and clean.
This story started when I arrived in this town with my family. We came here to build our own house because my father had been fired and we had to sell our house in Buenos Aires. My mother suggested coming here because one of her brothers was established here and he could help us.
I hadn't met all of the family (my uncle, my aunt and my beautiful cousin) before that day. My uncle, called Paul, invited us to stay with his family until we had built our house.
Three months ago, I cannot forget this day, my parents visited my aunt in hospital as she was ill. On this day I was really exhausted as I had been studying for 8 hours. I decided to stay at home and listen to music. I switched off the lights and I was sitting in bed.
First of all, the Internet makes my life easier. Some of my friends live  overseas. We keep in touch with e-mails. It is a very good way  to communicate because it is much cheaper than a phone call and we can re-read e-mails and keep them forever.
Another thing that is changing our lives is the computer, especially the Internet. More and more people are connecting to the net. Soon we won't need to leave  our homes. Now we can buy everything via the Internet, we can see what's happening on Wall Street, we can send mail in an easier way, by e-mail, and many people have started to work at home with their computers.
Finally, I would like to have my money back. I am looking forward to your prompt reply and .
Dear Sir, I'm writing this letter to you because I'm very disappointed and I believe you have to give me some money back. Last week I was in London to see your new musical show. Before I bought my ticket and made train and hotel reservations I'd read a lot of good reviews of that show and I thought it would be a great event to share with friends. But that evening became a real nightmare! Firstly, your advertisement is a real lie. Discounts available?? False and not true! Then the show was late starting, we had been waiting for a long long time before it started. But finally it started.. and what!! Danny Brook wasn't on the stage! I saw a young actor who I've never seen before and who did not seem to know his role by heart! Shame on you! After that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurant but what a surprise! It was closed (of course) and why? A general strike... It wasn't at all a perfect evening. I'm not pleased. I would weep if I wasn't so angry. To summarize, I want  you to give me my money back and very quickly. Yours faithfully..
You also say in your advertisement that there are some discounts available but there weren't any.
When I wake up, if I don't have homework I sit at my computer and play different games to occupy my time.
In the evenings before I go to bed I sit in the living room and watch TV via  satellite. When I go to bed, because there are many mosquitoes, I turn on a special machine with a battery-like thing in it which kills them.
We look forward to hearing from you regarding this matter.
You offered me a really wide range of activities to choose from, but I would have to go for basketball and tennis. I can say it with confidence that I am quite good at basketball - I play it for my school's team and I am going to train in it in August as well - I don't want to lose touch with it. Tennis is just something new that I recently discovered and I am still at  beginner level. It seems like a good opportunity to practise it.
If I was asked to choose the least attractive thing that I have to do on an everyday basis, shopping would most definitely be placed somewhere at the top of the list. If it were possible I would rather have someone else doing shopping for me.
I want to complain about your advertisement for the production 'Over the Rainbow'; I had a very disappointing evening.
The secret was that I was in love with Peter from my course. I shouldn't have told her, but I was so sure she wouldn't tell anyone.
Yesterday when I arrived at  college, I saw Pat standing with Peter and a lot of other boys and they were looking strangely at me and laughing. I felt how I started to blush. In the classroom it became even worse. People started to write things on the board and to point at me.
I'm writing to complain about the musical show "Over the Rainbow". I recently saw this in your theatre during my week's holiday in London and I must say I had a very disappointing evening! I was sure this was  London's newest and best musical show, the best I would ever see, because of the good publicity you gave yourself in your advertisement, but I thought completely wrong!
Finally, I hoped that, after these incidents, I would enjoy myself, but there was another change to the programme: the star! The main actor, Danny Brook, was changed and the one who played his part wasn't as good as I expected. After the show, I went to your theatre restaurant, but it was closed and this hadn't been said before. Moreover, I was shocked by the reason for which it had been closed: the chef left after he received a phone call!
There could be many things to say about this. Technology is a wide field which expands very quickly. It's creating an artificial world, where everything is electronic and fast. I'm not sure if I can say whether technology has changed our life in a positive way or not. Certainly, thanks to it, we can do things today that were impossible a few centuries ago. Nowadays, we can make a phone call with an astonishing rapidity, whereas in my grandparents' time it took one month or more to get in contact with people abroad, because the only means of communication was the post and its service was very slow! When the first car appeared, it was already a great success. Before that, people travelled by horse or worse. Fortunately today everyone can take an aeroplane and go to America, Australia or wherever else they want! What can I say about  television? It allows us to maintain connections with the other states of the world, improves our knowledge, offers us news, advises us about events which have happened or will happen. In, the not very distant, 1914, parents sent their sons to war and it was very difficult to know if they were still alive or dead! It's terrible!
Despite this, I'm convinced all this progress has caused some damage to the community, not only physically. We pay less attention to our life, to those things which give us happiness, that aren't money, success, power.
Finally, the restaurant where I would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed, contrary to what was announced in the advertisement. Nobody told us  the reason for these problems.
The only thing I can say about technology is that it has driven my life. Modern technology captures my imagination, and this is the reason why I have chosen a career in electronics. I don't think technology changes  lifestyle. It is the lifestyle or needs of people that make technology develop. All kinds of industrial machines are created to solve problems, improve other machines or to save  time. But these machines bring new problems that must be solved by others.
I don't know how much money I'll need for the trip or what kind of clothes I'll need. Do you have any , like going to discos or nightclubs? Can you give me this information?
Anyway, other alternatives to shopping are being created and we can choose  not to waste our time shopping.
Thank you very much for your letter of 1/6/00. I was really amazed by the news that I'd won two weeks at Camp California in the USA.
With regard to the date that I would like to travel it must be  July 15th because my classes will finish at the end of June and I'm going to have some free time  from this date until early August when I will start to work.
Would you be so kind as to let me know what kind of weather  you have in July in order that I can choose the right clothing to bring. And also I would like to know approximately the amount of money that I should bring for the items that are not included.
I am writing to you  to complain about the last Saturday evening performance at your theatre. I was very disappointed! First of all, the principal character was not Danny Brook, but a substitute, and the theatre had not notified the audience about this change before the performance.
After the show, we decided to go to the restaurant for dinner, but it was closed for repairs. Everything was completely different from what you had announced in the advertisement
Modern technology has changed my daily life, making it easy, with less effort and time spent on . A simple example, we can, at the same time, wash our clothes in a washing machine, record a TV programme and talk to someone on the other side of the world. All this in one morning, and the day has just begun, what is to do next?
Technology allows us to have more time for leisure or for other things we really like to do. We can take care of those we love and give them more attention; time is not really a problem. We will see people differently,  more calmly, because we suffer no stress and we are not in a hurry to do something else. We will be more understanding with others. It is the first step towards a true fraternity.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I need to stay at home in August. I am a college student and I am going to study at university this year. I will take my exams in June and have the results in August. So I shall stay to prepare for my university.
The English class is going to make a short video about the school's daily life. The aim of this report is to give some suggestions about which lessons and activities should be filmed.
The topical class is similar to speaking and listening but the materials are more up to date. The teacher uses video and pictures to teach students about festivals, sports, museums, etc. It is popular with the students.
Now at the age of seventeen I made the huge mistake of mentioning this problem to my "friend" Pat. I knew that she was close to my brother and that she loved him a lot, so I never thought that things would turn out like this.
When one day Pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up. Pat started shouting and screaming, saying what was really going on. My brother couldn't stay away. He stood outside my door and heard every single word. When I realised , it was too late. The secret had been revealed. And now I try to help my brother because I've been there, in his place, and I know how it feels.
I am so grateful and I can't believe I am so lucky to receive your letter in which you said that I have won the first prize in your competition, of two weeks camping in California in the U.S.A.
I am writing to inform you that I can only go in July, the summer holiday, because I have got a place at  university and it will start in August. Is  the time I request available? I would also like to ask  accommodation you offer is in tents or log cabins. If I can choose I would prefer tents. I like to sleep on open land and see the sun come up in the morning.
In addition, I choose painting and sailing for my activities. I can't wait to do my painting of the rising sun, and can't imagine how wonderful sailing along the rivers will be.
Shopping is not always enjoyable. I don't really like shopping. Sometimes when I'm bored and can't find something else to do, I go look round the shops. When I see some clothes in the window I like, I  go in and try them on. But I always find they do not look nice on me.  at the weekend. All the shops are full of people, and people treat the items like rubbish, hanging them everywhere after they have tried them on and found that they did not suit them.
Also with  weekend shopping, you  can't find somewhere to sit down comfortably to have a cup of tea. Mc.Donnals, K.F.C, are all full of people.
However, shopping is a nice way to spend your leisure time and give yourself a chance to relax sometimes, but I suggest that you never do it at the weekend.
According to your advertisement, it stars DANNY BROOK and TINA TRUELOVE, but surprisingly,   was performed by a different actor of whom I didn't even know the name. In addition, the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it started half an hour later, at 20:15.
The first and most important thing is that modern technology has made our life easier, for instance the rice cooker is a great invention, all you have to do is put rice in it and switch it on, it makes cooking more efficient. Furthermore, we  use the computer and telephone a lot. Wherever you are, you can get in touch with people whenever you want.
Spending a week in London on holiday last week, I decided to go to the theatre in order to see your wonderful musical show. Unfortunately, I had a really disappointing evening! Indeed, first, the performance didn't start at 19:30 as it was meant to according to the advertisement but 45 minutes later (20:15).
Furthermore, in the advertisement I got, it was written that the theatre restaurant was open. I told myself, I could eat over there and maybe have a better evening than I was having at the beginning of the show but I wasn't lucky because the restaurant was closed! The customers weren't told why they couldn't have a meal. No reasons were given.
Indeed,  modernisation helps us to lead a more comfortable and better life than before. For example, cars and planes are  wonderful inventions! A few centuries ago, it took many hours (even several days) to go from one city to another  or to travel abroad. People couldn't  of such innovation in our world and yet, it was created. Mankind became more and more clever and built wonderful things thanks to his thoughts and his hands.
Communication has made many advances too. Everyone has a television at home. "A machine which talks and shows pictures!" It's a revolution, something which was unbelievable a few centuries ago. Although there are new machines etc,  medicine makes many discoveries thanks to  research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
In the past 100 years, fashion has changed a great deal. Nowadays clothes are designed to be more comfortable. You can just "pop down the road" and go shopping. The material and colours of your clothes have changed since the early 1900s . Synthetics have been created by scientists. Clothes are now mass-produced and designed by designers.
About the activities at the camp, I can tell you that I like to play tennis and I play it very well. Another thing I want to try, if possible, is to play golf. It's a very popular sport in our region (area) also, but I have never found time to do it. I'm a beginner at golf you have to know.
Now a question from me to you: is it possible to pay for the different things by credit card? Another question - what sort of clothes shall I bring with me? Is July a hot and dry month or does it rain sometimes?
I think this will be all I want to know. If there are any other questions on your part, please call me or write again.
The concert started on the 15th of May and it was a really great session in our valley. I was so happy when they asked me to help them with the organisation. I was responsible for the advertisements and I also had to invite the "important people" from our government. It was really a new job for me, but I think I did well. I've learned a lot about management and especially  how stars live.
However, we would be grateful if you would arrange a time to visit the show as well. This show takes place at the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday from 10:00 to 19:00. At this show, not only can we see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles, but we can also enter for free. Moreover some students think that they would like to do fashion studies in future. If you  accept and wouldn't mind this idea, we would like to visit it instead of shopping in the afternoon on Tuesday.
A few years ago, we had the terrible news of the death of Lady Diana. She was always being pursued by the media. She had no private life even though she wanted to be alone. Finally, after being chased for a long time, she was killed in a car accident. It must be a good example of a media disaster. I understand she had a good reason to be chased by it. However, she definitely deserved to have a private life as a citizen. Human rights must exist for all people.
I am very happy to know I won the prize of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Referring to sports, I would choose swimming and basketball, because when I was a child I used to swim a lot, I won a lot of prizes and I went to a lot of competitions. About basketball, I would say I like to play it as well because it was my favourite sport in highschool. I was not as good at it as I was at swimming but I like it.
Thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. I also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which I have the opportunity to go to California, a place that I always wanted to go to.
About the trip, I think it would be preferable to do it in July, which is a holiday period and so I won't have any  obligations. While in California I would prefer to sleep in a tent, so I can be closer to  nature. Anyway the accommodation is not a big problem for me, because I will be away most of the time. Spending a lot of time in the same place in my opinion is the worst thing to do, especially during a holiday! Moreover I would like it if it is possible to have an opportunity to play tennis and basketball. Any little  of this kind would be great.
Before ending my letter I would like to know  in particular  what kind of clothes  I have to take with me and also if you could change some money of mine into dollars.
I'm writing to you to describe some problems with your theatre's show. First I have to say to you that there was a different actor to the one advertised starring in the play. I expected the star of the play to be Danny Brook and there was another man. I'm very disappointed with the time that the play started. I had been waiting for more than half an hour.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. I was fourteen years old and I was with my best friend, Pat. We were in a private school, which looked like a castle, in London and we had been staying there for two months. Our parents took us there because they wanted  us to become good  polite girls. Life in the school was very boring and sometimes we organized games to have fun  there. One day I discovered a secret path in the school. This path went from our bedroom to the director's room. I thought it was a good idea to tell  Pat because we could use it to look for exams, and then we could pass all of them. When I told  her, she promised  me that she would keep the secret. But in a few days she told the secret to all the class. All our mates wanted to enjoy our fantastic  secret path to look for exams. Then somebody told  a teacher and the teachers went to talk to our parents. They were very angry and disappointed with us. Nowadays, I remember this story as a bad experience. 
I am writing this letter to you in order to complain about the musical show ('Over the Rainbow') that was performed at your theatre last week;  on Friday evening.
First of all, I should say that I had read fantastic reviews of it in several newspapers, specially regarding the starring actors' superb performances. These were in perfect agreement with my previous opinion of your company, which is said to be the best producer of musical shows in Europe. With all these considerations in mind, I attended your theatre on the referred day with the aim of having a perfect evening.
This is going to take place on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00.
Everyone deserves to be given the right to a private life.
Besides when I went to the restaurant it was closed, and I could not see it. But the main reason for my complaint, is that in the advertisement it was said it would be my perfect evening out, and it was not.
Nowadays, with my computer, I can travel anywhere in the world, just by having it connected to a modem. The Internet has changed my life because, with it, we can do everything at home. For example if one day I forgot a book, I can find the book on the Internet, and more information too.
I have just received your letter and I thank you for your invitation and congratulations. I am really proud to be the winner of your competition and I would like to express my satisfaction with your perfect organisation.
I have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy. The reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject. Also the sports activities should be filmed; they express an  and social way of living school life and can be useful to show  the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events.
The dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements.
Sir, I returned very unhappy from my holidays. The reason is that the musical show that I had seen with my wife, first of all, started late. We bought tickets for the second show, which was at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! We were interested in seeing the actors that appeared on the tickets and I was very disappointed when, in the show, we saw other actors. The tickets were more expensive than we had expected, but we didn't care because we saw on the tickets that there would be discounts given, but, they didn't give us discounts! With all these problems, the only thing that kept us going was the thought of eating something. When the show finished we went to the theatre restaurant and it was closed because the staff didn't go to work that day.
On Sunday night, when my parents arrived, they asked her if I had stayed at home on Saturday. My sister stayed silent for a minute and then started laughing; so my parents, with her laugh, knew that I had gone out that Saturday; and punished me for a year.
I also would like to talk about your concerts. The concerts are fabulous but the problem is the halls. They are too small for all the people. Could you do something about these problems?
At home, I'm not allowed to watch television after 8 p.m. I must do my homework when I come back  home. I must also help my parents with home activities, for example, clean my room and the other rooms, or cook, etc.... I hope this information will help you,
First of all, I want you to know I am really happy about the prize. The only problem is that as I am a student I can travel only during the holidays, in July. Regarding accommodation I would rather stay in a tent because I have never been  camping and I would like to try it.
I'm really happy because I've finally received your letter. If I didn't tell you about my experience at the pop concert in detail in my last letter it was because I didn't have time. Please don't be angry. I will tell you everything right now.
A few months ago I chatted, via the Internet, to a nice guy from Buenos Aires who happened to be one of the members of "Los Pericos". We started mailing each other and became good friends. They had to give a concert in my city so when they arrived here my friend phoned me and invited me to where they were preparing the concert.
The problem was that one of the technicians was from England and nobody there spoke  a word of English so I was asked to be the interpreter. It was so great!! Not only because I learnt a lot about concerts and music, but also because I practised my English.
I have just received your letter and I'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so hard.
However, about accommodation, I'd prefer a log cabin, because it is more comfortable than a tent. All the activities indicated in your letter are great for me but I prefer tennis and surfing, because I'm used to playing tennis  every weekend and I'm very keen on surfing. I'm a good tennis player and a big surfer too.
Lastly, I'm interested in the law schools in California. They are very famous here.
Last month I visited Tom, another old friend, and he told me I could work with him as a musician at the XZY pop concert. "This is extraordinary", I said.
Firstly, I was very embarrassed during the concert, but all the staff were very kind to me and Tom too. This was the most important experience in my life, I knew all the people, in  particular the famous singer "Kos". He is funny and easy going. During the concert, I was near the  and opposite there was "Pipe" the biggest  in the world. It's very difficult describing all the emotions I felt. I can only tell you that it had been an important experience for me and for my new songs. Excuse me Kim, but I'm so nervous that I won't be able to write even this letter .
TO THE MANAGER OF "THE CIRCLE THEATRE" AFTER FINISHING A STRESSFUL YEAR AT SCHOOL, I TOOK A SHORT HOLIDAY, AND ITS "SPLENDID ENDING" WAS A WEEK IN LONDON. WHILE I WAS THERE, I SAW A VERY ATTRACTIVE SIGN: "OVER THE RAINBOW" THE MUSICAL  WAS PLAYING AT YOUR THEATRE, MOREOVER, THE WONDERFUL DANNY BROOK WAS THE STAR IN IT. SADLY, I DECIDED TO GO, ALONG WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT THE PROBLEMS STARTED EVEN BEFORE THE SHOW, WHEN WE WANTED TO BUY THE TICKETS. WE ASKED ABOUT "THE DISCOUNTS" THAT WERE OFFERED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE LADY WHO WAS SELLING THE TICKETS COULD SAY WAS: WHAT DISCOUNTS? THEN, WE MOVED INSIDE THE THEATRE AND WE HAD TO WAIT 45 MINUTES UNTIL THE SHOW BEGAN!!, WHILE WE WERE WAITING, WE THOUGHT WE COULD GO TO THE RESTAURANT AFTER THE EVENT, AND THEN WE REALIZED IT WAS CLOSED. BY THE TIME THE SHOW STARTED, WE WERE SO ANGRY THAT THE ONLY THING I REMEMBER IS THAT DANNY BROOK WASN'T ACTING. I THINK YOU HAVE ALREADY REALIZED THAT IT WASN'T A PLEASURE FOR US TO SEE THE SHOW, SO I HOPE YOU CAN GIVE ME OUR MONEY BACK, IF YOU CAN'T, PLEASE, AT LEAST GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION. YOURS FAITHFULLY
TODAY, I CAN DO MOST OF MY SCHOOL HOMEWORK WITH THE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND IT DOESN'T WEIGH MORE THAN AN APPLE! I CAN READ ALL THE NEWS AS SOON AS IT HAPPENS IN THE VIRTUAL NEWSPAPERS AND I CAN TALK WITH MY FOREIGN FRIENDS THANKS TO THE ICQ PROGRAM. I HAD NEVER USED THE INTERNET BEFORE, BUT IT HAS CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE.
I'm writing to tell you about the horrible evening I had on Friday. I was very excited at the idea of going to the theatre, but it didn't work out as I thought it would.
I went with a group of friends to help and organise a gig of a pop band. It was so easy. I mean we just carried all the instruments of the musicians to the Club and we put them on the stage. After this, we helped at the  bar, putting all the drinks and refreshments into the fridges. And that was it! I enjoyed doing this a lot and  the gig was free for all of us. The concert was in a massive club and the tickets were sold out. Marvellous!
Yesterday afternoon, when I went home, my mother wanted to talk to me about something, so I went into her bedroom to speak to her. She told me that she knew that last Saturday I went to a party without asking her and that she had to punish me for that. She told me that I had to stay at home at the weekend and not go out with my friends.
When I went to my bedroom I realised that Pat had told my mother about the party, because no one else knew that my mother did not know that .
Change wasn't common and Governments didn't invest enough money in it. Nowadays, technology is changing our life every day.
Maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse these changes and to put limits on technology, because I think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
The excitement is not created by bloody fights but by the strength of the protagonist. He is old and he wants to win this last competition between him and  nature. So he bears everything: the days and nights on the sea, without any food or water, the terrible summer sun,  being injured from keeping hold of the line on which the fish is caught.
The reader feels for him, wants to know if he will win or wonders why he will not give up.
I have gone out onto the street and I have asked  people  this question. I have  all the answers and I have written this article.
I really think that living in the future will be like living on the moon - very exciting. And people will wear cybernetic clothes but at the same time comfortable clothes. I believe that they will wear colourful jeans, T-shirts, mountain boots, etc. And all of this with a lot of colour. From my point of view, they will enjoy themselves more than people do now because they will have many things to do.
On the other hand, most  people in the future will wear glasses. That is because sunlight is very bad. In the end everyone will be short-sighted.
Well, regarding the accommodation at Camp California I would prefer staying in a tent. I think it is more fun sleeping in a tent than in a log cabin. It is more like an adventure being in a tent, and you are closer to  nature, and the animals!
For my activities I think I will choose swimming because I love swimming and being in the water. And I am really good at it.  I used to enter  competitions when I was younger. And for the other activity I will choose tennis. I really enjoy this sport. I am not really a good player but I like to play tennis in my free time! Since I'm coming in the month of July what kind of clothes should I take with me?  And I have another question. It's about money. How much should I take? And is it better to have cash or cheques?
Well this is absolutely true, especially when you go shopping on Saturday. Everyone goes shopping on Saturday so the mall is always crowded, and most of the people are stressed.  It's crazy. For example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want. And then they have it and you have to wait to try on the pants or the skirt you have chosen. And you have to wait after that to buy it, so finally you have waited so long that you have become late, so you get stressed too. So it's really not enjoyable to go shopping. Plus, most of the time, you see all those mothers looking after their kids, and yelling their kids' names in the shopping mall because they have lost them. So you get a headache because you hear the kids crying, the mothers yelling.  If I can give you some advice: DON'T GO SHOPPING ON SATURDAY!! You get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruises because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!
Looking forward to your answer.
Going out to spend a day shopping is something very popular. The shopping centres are always busy, with people going up and down carrying bags and looking in shop windows; it seems everybody is happy.
In the hurry you've forgotten to bring any cash, but you can use your plastic money. The shop assistant passes the credit card through the machine, after a few seconds he does it again, and does it another time . Suddenly his face changes and he tells you that the card is faulty! No choice: you have to leave your nice clothes and go away feeling bad and sad.
I can only travel in July because this is the month when I have holidays. I've already talked to my manager, and she said that that's the only month I can have my holidays.
I wish you had been there with me helping at a pop concert. I just loved it. I was working with this music system. You know how good I am at musicAnyway I was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. At the beginning I was connecting all these wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... The bit that I particularly liked about the experience was when I was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar - you know how much I love playing guitar - and all these video cameras were just filming us. I asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on tv, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your tv on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing  this guitar. AH, it was lovely. These singers are going to come next year so I want to invite you to my house for one or two weeks to see this pop concert. Believe me, you'll love it and you might play the drums. I told them that you're really good on drums so they want to try you too.
I would rather stay in log cabins than tents. I have some trouble with my back. Therefore I can't sleep in a sleeping bag on the ground.
Furthermore, I would love to do basketball and painting activities while I am at the camp. I am a member of the college basketball team, which became the best basketball team of last year. Secondly, I want to do painting, which I am really interested in  as a student at art college.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. We all know that she isn't good at keeping her mouth shut at all, but it should have been better this time. Her brother Philip had just passed his last exam at the university and was going to graduate in a few days.
"Are you looking for these?" asked Philip, showing the keys to the car.
Firstly, I wish to travel in July as I already have plans for June, which are to visit France for 3 weeks as soon as my summer vacation commences.
Secondly, regarding the question of lodging, I have chosen tents since I enjoy camping in them very much.
I am looking forward to being received at camp California.
I am writing to draw your attention to the musical show that took place yesterday evening. None of the conditions were fulfilled: firstly, Danny Brook, who was going to perform in the show, was changed for another actor. As a result it was a disappointing performance. Furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said that it was going to begin at 19:30.
Furthermore,  there weren't any discounts on the price of the tickets.
In fact, I like technology but sometimes I wish it had never existed since there are too many things on the market. Indeed, when you want to buy a television, for example, there are a lot of different makes. And it's all the more tiring since you often wait for two weeks before getting it. I'm bound to feel tense.
Fashion reflects the way we live so we can expect that fashion will be connected to technology and society.
Hoping that I have not offended you in any way and that you might take into consideration my suggestions, I wish you all the best for next year's festival organisation.
Last week, I was on holiday in London, and having read the advertisement for your musical show, I had planned (as it  said) "a perfect evening out".
Pat was my friend, I trusted her and we got on very well until she repeated to everyone the secret I had told her. There was only one thing I didn't like about her: she would do anything to have friends, even betray me.
The end-of-conference party will take place on a boat cruising on the lake. It will start with a speech from the Director of the conference, followed by a meal. The recreational part will begin at 10 pm with a short musical comedy performed by some of our students and end with fireworks launched from the roof of the college at 2 am. As nights may be cold at this time of the year, may I suggest that you take with you a pullover. Apart from that, there is no recommendation as to what to wear.
The mobile phone is a marvellous invention, but as with cigarettes, we should write on it:
Finally, on the last afternoon, we could visit the museums and markets (we have a very interesting robot-market). Basically it's  free time for the students to look round  by themselves.
I'm looking forward to seeing you at the conference.
First of all, the efficiency of  society has been improved. When shopping, we don't need to wait for the cashier to  by hand. When booking a flight, we can just make a phone call to any agency, and get it done in one minute. Secondly, instead of  tons of books to get the information that we need, we can very easily search for it on the Internet or on the local network. It's  very often heard that someone who has a rare illness has had an operation at a foreign institute which he found via the Internet. Moreover, with computer networks, it is possible for people to work from home,  projects, controlling operations or  conferences. Lastly  has also changed. Instead of  traditional telecommunications, we can talk by, e-mail or even see each other with the help of a computer network.
In conclusion, computers have become a  necessity in our life, and it's still a young invention, which needs to be improved.
Gaudi conceived of this church in 1912, though it wasn't until 1920 they started to build it. Since the beginning the work has been interrupted at different times and started again. After Gaudi's death  three years later. Nowadays,  hard work is being done in order to finish it as soon as possible.
I'm very happy to have won  your competition. I've never been to the U.S.A so I'm very excited to visit  Camp California. I can come only in July because I have to work the other months of summer. Regarding accommodation I'd prefer to sleep in a tent because I like being outside and hearing the noises of the sea.
- In the maths lesson and the English lesson we could show how the teacher teaches  his students. We could  film the classroom too.
At the end we could have a comment from each student in our class.
I've got some great news to tell you. Last month, I got a part-time job. I really enjoyed helping at a pop concert. As you know, I'm crazy about pop music. Before the concert I was really excited. I couldn't sleep well and I didn't know what I had to do at the concert.
I learnt lots of thing  there that I couldn't learn from school. I had to be more patient. I met lots of people with different jobs. I had a great time.
As you know, I am in charge of organising the conference in my college. Do not worry if Richard did not leave you all the information. I am pleased to help you.
We looked at every hotel in town, trying to give you the best offer. We found two good hotels and we decided on the Palace Hotel. This has the best price that we could find. On the conference day our school driver is going to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the conference.
The Museum is situated in front of the sea in the centre of Acapulco. It is situated on the top of a little mountain in the "old" part of the city. You are able to get there by car or on foot and see everything which was made at that time.
First of all, I congratulate you for organizing such an exciting festival.  It was a great idea, and I enjoyed myself at this festival very much.
Finally, I'd like to mention the reasonably-priced weekend ticket.  It was brillient, because if I had to pay for all things individually I wouldn't have attended it, because it was very expensive for me.  Thank you very much for that.
But, even if he was very poor, he was very good and had a lot of affection for the people who were much poorer than his family, so he looked after them.
The following year, when the bird returned to his house, he gave him a message.  It was a kind of map that showed the location of a lot of money which robbers hid.
People believe that the bird was sent from heaven.
But I think I prefer the clothes now. I'll stick to baggy t-shirts, jeans, baseball caps and trainers. They'll do for me instead of all the silvers and golds. Al the spacy theme. I think I'll be fine in the clothes we have now... I mean, I won't get sick of them!
Unfortunately I have never been to the US so I don't have any idea about how much money I will probably need or about what kind of clothes I have to take with me.
Certainly only the fact of having something can help people to be more sure of themselves. In fact if you have the new Kalvin Klein product to a certain kind of person you are cool, but is it really so important?
You know that helping you is a real pleasure for me. You really don't have to become flat broke from buying things for me but I am interested in American culture. So a tiny "Statue of Liberty" will be nice. I will finish now as I have a mountain of work to do. I am looking forward to hearing from you.
The telephone is a very important invention, which has affected our lives. It is a way for people to communicate although they are in two different places. People use the telephone every day and it is one of the most important things in daily life.
People also use the telephone in their personal life. For example, when you want to talk to your family or to your friends who live far away. Another aspect is that people have more time if they have a telephone. They are able to give and receive information very quickly.
And computers are the most important product of technology. In the world, people spend the whole day  playing with computers. Not only as a hobby. They use computers for their work. They communicate with other businessmen and do their jobs with the help of computers. Sometimes they don't go to their offices. They write their secret notes on  computers. Computers hold them in their memory. But in the past people had to use lots of notebooks and they also had to find places to hide them.
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the show you put on two weeks ago at your theatre.
As I was spending a weekend in London. I took the opportunity to see the performance of one of my favourite actors, Danny Brook. Unfortunately as soon as I got to the theatre I was told that there had been a change in the cast and Danny Brook was not part of it anymore. Besides, since my girlfriend and I had really to hurry up to reach the theatre on time we hadn't had any dinner, as we had been thinking of having it at your restaurant. You cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. In fact this was the main reason for Mr White's resignation and suicide. Pat was not a very clever teenager and while she was attending  Secondary School she had many problems with Chemistry. I could actually say that if it hadn't been for Mr. White she would never have passed her exam to enter University. Mr White came to our school when he was 40 years old but still good-looking and all my female school-mates fell suddenly in love with him; he was always so kind and generous towards his pupils that any girl felt herself loved by him: Pat certainly was one of them. One day while she was walking in Central Park she saw a man and a young girl sitting under a tree. Immediately she recognized her beloved teacher kissing one of her classmates and she ran away as fast as she could. She was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr White that without any hesitation she went to the school Headmaster to report everything she had seen. The next day Mr White was charged with abuse and obliged to resign. The trial was long and received  wide coverage from the media. We live in a small and old-fashioned town and Mr. White was considered a monster: losing his job was hard for him, but even harder was the loss of his beloved pupils who were not allowed to meet him; so, on a bright summer day he took his final decision and died, terrified by the darkness which was nearing.
The group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, a five star hotel, which offers many facilities. It is famous for its friendly staff and comfortable rooms. The students can get there on the No 35 bus. They must get on the bus from the city centre and get off after five stops at Palace Station. The hotel is opposite the station.
On the last day, the students can enjoy a sightseeing tour around the city, which can be arranged if the students want to. The group can also visit the zoo, the opera or stay and relax in the college's enormous garden and enjoy the scenery.
Location: The castle is in the city centre near an enormous church. You can get to the city centre on the No.456 bus and then go on foot to the castle.
Activities: At the time of the year you will visit Nyremberg, many theatrical plays or concerts are taking place in the castle.
First of all, we have booked the Palace Hotel for your group. This hotel is quiet and near the conference building. However, I would suggest going by bus from the hotel to the conference because this is the most convenient form of transport. Furthermore, as usual, we will organise a party at the end of the conference, therefore, it would be great if your students wore a suit (for a man) or a skirt (for a woman). Furthermore, this party will be in your hotel as in the previous years. Finally, there are a lot of museums in our town. Therefore, I would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fascinating.
I would suggest this place because it is interesting to discover the oldest civilisation in the world in one of the most modern buildings.
First, this international student conference has the aim of explaining to students how important education is. In addition to this, we have chosen the luxury Palace Hotel, which is comfortable enough and in a good location. The Palace Hotel is located in the centre of the city, so you can come by train, by bus or by car. I suggest you should go by train and get off at  Museum Station. The conference will be held in the hotel, which is .
The conference, ,  is  quite well organized. It will start at eight in the morning and will finish around five in the afternoon. I suggest you should wear something informal. Even though we want to make things as comfortable as possible for our students.
However, the invention of the airplane has brought us some . How could a person go from Brazil to Australia without it? Maybe by boat, but it could take too long! The best way is definitely by air. With this invention travel around the world is so much easier. Now, we have to say thanks and congratulate all the inventors who invented  for us.
First of all the hotel Richard Brown has looked at is the Palace Hotel. It's located close to the main train station in our town. It is quite near the conference building. There will be extra buses to get there. The bus will pick you up right at your hotel entrance. The end-of-conference party will be a small dinner for all the students. You do not have to wear special clothes, just wear what you always wear. If you take your uniform with you it would be pleasant to leave it at the hotel and wear something else.
Our church is a very famous building in our country. It is eighty metres long and its tower is forty-five metres tall. On the top of the tower it has a huge clock on each side. The tower is red and the church itself is painted white. In the church are many expensive drawings. There is space for about five hundred people. The church was built in 1385. It was rebuilt in 1948 because of the Second World War, when it had been damaged. The church is located in a place where you can see the whole Rigi mountain chain. Visit our church because it is one of the most famous churches in our country. It has an interesting past. The tower is absolutely marvellous. You can walk to the top of the tower and it gives you a beautiful view. If you want to visit the church, there will be a special guide who will show you all the things and answer your questions. Entry is free.
I received your letter and I'm happy to help you. We booked the Palace Hotel for your group. It's nice and quiet. I'm sure you'll be fine here. We chose the Palace Hotel because it's near our college, too. So you are going to get to the conference in a few minutes. When you go out of the hotel turn right and go straight on; turn right again at the first crossroads. At the end of this street you can see our college on your left. It's a green building. At the end-of-conference party there'll be something to eat and to drink. In the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college. You'll see all the generations who passed through here. Clothes aren't very important, but it'll be fine if the people wear something different from the usual jeans.
What would our world be without television? It isn't easy to give an answer to this question. Television is an important invention. It has given us a better  means of communication. This animated box can give us a lot of information  from all around the world.
The Palace Hotel has been booked and you should first walk from the hotel to the Town Hall railway station, which is on the North City Line, which is the yellow line on the map. After getting on the train, you should get off at the Mountain station, which is twenty minutes away. It is opposite the conference venue.
As a teenager I must admit that there is nothing more enjoyable than shopping. It's like ,,walking in the clouds,, you feel like you are flying. Choosing gives me such great pleasure because I never have to worry about where  I get money for my wishes. It all comes from my parents. All I have to do is buy and choose. I think that ,,having is a dream'' for all of us.
I am glad to help you with the organisation of the international student conference.
I am writing a report, in which I will describe for you the most important building in my town.
The most important building of Biasco is the ,,Casa Cavalier Pellanda". It is the big old house of a rich lord in the middle of the town. In this house there is a big museum, where you can learn about the history of Biasco.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is only 2 miles away from our college. The college will arrange for a mini-bus to come and pick you up every morning at 8:45, so you can arrive at the college around 9 o'clock and have some time before the conference starts at 9:15. The reason we don't suggest you walk from your hotel is that you'd have to walk through a large building site which is not going to be suitable for a group of 20 students.
In my personal opinion one of the most important and useful things which has been invented is the car. Cars play a big part in our life. Everywhere you look you can see cars. More and more people are learning how to drive and choosing to travel by car, because it saves a lot of time compared to travelling by public transport. Cars are also more reliable than other types of transport. You don't have to wait at a bus stop in  cold and windy weather for a late bus, or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs. You can just jump into a car, tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.
Don't miss the chance to visit the historical museum, located in the heart of the capital city. A traditional building which was built at the beginning of the century, the historical museum is simply a symbol, a  of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: their freedom. There are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967. The museum provides the visitor with the opportunity to see original pieces of writing, famous paintings having as their main subject the revolution of 1821, and aspects of the Greek religion that have always been considered to be a vital part of Greek history. There is a small entry fee. Inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books, maps etc.
The hotel that we booked is the Palace Hotel, which is near the bus station. When you are in the bus station you will catch  bus number 37, which will go to the town centre. From there you will walk to the college because it is easier to get there that way than to get  another bus. Anyway the college is the first road on your right from the town centre.
Introduction: I am writing to describe the location and architecture for you and tell the story of the old Roman school of Courtelary. I hope that you will go there with your group because it has a lot of beautiful things to see. It is the only old Roman school in the world.
History: It all began when Ogus Micius said that Romans needed to go to school. They decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever. During the Second World War all the schools were demolished and only ours is left.
Conclusion: I have given you a lot of reasons to go to this building and I hope you will enjoy your trip to my town.
Firstly, I have already booked the Palace Hotel for the students. That is the hotel near my college. It takes five minutes to get to my college on foot. I will .
Dear Mrs Smith, Thank you for your letter  asking for my help with the conference. I would like to do my best to help you.
Firstly, Palace Hotel has been booked  for the group's accommodation and I spoke with the hotel manager about travelling to the conference. The hotel has its own buses, they will take us from the hotel to the conference .
Finally, you would like to know about some activities for three hours of free time. I think you can go to the 'Dreamland'. In this place there are video games, some little competitions and a small zoo available. Students can enjoy their time in this place and it is on the way to the airport.
4. There is no charge for entrance and it has a good view for tourists to see Ankara from the hill. It opens from 8.00 am to 5.00 pm.
The hotel which we have reserved for your group is the Palace Hotel. It is not far from our college, taking 20 minutes by car. It would be a good idea to take a taxi from the hotel to the college because the total number of members in your group is 4 and a taxi fare would not be expensive. There is a taxi rank opposite the hotel.
There are many sources of light in this world, such as sunlight, moonlight and candlelight. Some of them are natural whereas the others are not. Owing to an increasing demand for light, for more activities, the natural source is not adequate. Therefore, electric light was invented.
Firstly, for your information, the group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is located in the town centre. Students can take the airport bus directly to the hotel when you arrive. And the best way to get from there to the conference is  by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here. Therefore it is no good taking a bus. I will help you to book the coach.
Secondly, the end-of-conference party will be held at the college's main hall, from 8:00 pm to 11:30 pm on 20th June. There will be various kinds of food and drinks provided. Moreover, students can dance and enjoy different sorts of music, for instance, rock, jazz, pop, garage and so on. Furthermore, I suggest you and the students wear  to it, as they are suitable for dancing.
Finally, on the last day, I suggest you  go to the market in town during the 3-hour gap. It is a nice place to buy  British-style gifts for your family and friends. You could also enjoy the tea at the cafÃ©s nearby.
The location of Po Lin Temple is on Lotus Island, which is the second biggest island in Hong Kong.
You could go sightseeing around the Temple and take photos. Of course, you may acquire a greater knowledge of Hong Kong, as the temple has been here for nearly 100 years. You mustn't miss the famous Big Buddha, or you will be sorry. The temple also provides free Chinese traditional-style meals for visitors.
The Palace Hotel has been booked for the group, and, from there to the conference, we have organized  the hotel's bus service to take the students to the conference. We will meet in the lobby at 9.00 AM.
The conference party will last until 1.00 AM, but everybody does not need to stay until the end. There will be a bus taking students who do not want to stay at the party until the end. The bus will be  at 9.30 PM and 11.30 PM, then at the end of the party there will be the last one. Everybody is free to dress for the party but consider what is appropriate.
As now I'm away from home, the telephone is very important to me. Having a telephone I can call my mother and my friends, which prevents me from feeling homesick; not completely but I think it's better than . To hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. You can imagine their face clearly.
I had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch through e-mail. The problem was the language. We used English but neither of us were very good at it at the time, which made us misunderstand each other. However, the problem was solved by a telephone. We are now still friends. Thanks to the invention of the telephone.
I think that it will be nice for the end-of-conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give  the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance. The party  will be nice. Now the clothes that they will wear  have to be smart, not the kind you would wear if you were going to a casino for example but nice casual,  sports shoes or T-shirts.
First of all we need the telephone in our house because it's important to make a call if you need something or if  something happens to your house and nobody is with you.
Television is a good way to be informed about the news. I prefer being informed by television than by newspapers; it's more relaxing.
First of all, the group has been booked into 'THE PALACE HOTEL'. You won't have any problem finding the college because it's opposite the hotel, and the conference will be there.
First of all, I think I'm going to be busy on the 4th of April. Can we change the  to the 5th of April, at 4 o'clock?
Thanks very much for letting me use your things during my stay. I may need to use  the computer and the CD player. Is that OK with you?
I am writing to answer your letter where you asked for information about the conference and other points in relation to it.
The hotel where your group has been booked is the Palace Hotel. It is a very nice hotel in the centre of the city, and that is very near to the college where the conference is being held - five minutes' walk. Walking is quicker than waiting for a taxi or a bus. When you arrive at the colleges there will be people indicating the way to the conference room.
The last  with computers is the Internet. With the Internet you can communicate with people in different places of the world at the same moment. And you can get lots of information about a lot of things. You can find everything that you need on the Internet.
You have been booked to stay in the Palace Hotel, which is a very pleasant hotel not far away from here. The best way to get here is  : once you go out of the hotel, turn right, then follow the signs to the hospital, because it is just beside our college. When you are in the college, ask for me.
Apart from being in fashion, it is also a very helpful machine. Do you remember that day when you got stuck in the middle of the road with your car which wouldn't work? What would you have done at that moment without a mobile phone? You were at home in less than ten minutes just because you had a mobile phone with you, amazing, isn't it?
After the conference we are planning to organise a big party with a barbecue. The party will take place in a forest close to a campsite. I hope we will have  nice weather. Therefore, I suggest wearing  casual clothes. On the afternoon of the last day, if you have some free time, I would recommend you visit a very famous exhibition of Leonardo Devinci. The exhibition will take place at the "Gribaldi museum", which you can find on  Crariden street, N 5. You will never regret  my suggestion. If you need more information let me know.
report by the group leader
First, I'd like to tell you that the hotel where you are going to stay is "The Palace Hotel", which is situated at the centre of the town. It can't be difficult to find, because it is very near to the conference. Also there is a bus provided by the organisation to take all the students to the hotel. At the end of the conference there will be a party. I might suggest you wear a casual outfit, because many students feel like relaxing after a whole day sitting and listening at the conference. The party will be  by a group of musicians, and  I remember  last year it was unforgettable, because all the people were dancing and having a lot of fun.
Firstly, about your accommodation, the college which I belong to offers visitors free accommodation with  facilities (for example, bath, car park, free internet access, etc.).  located on our campus so you can get to the conference by walking.
I find it amazingly easy to forget the importance of inventions which we usually use without  thinking. That's the nature of human beings. But I think it's not only our fault but  evidence of how much they have integrated themselves into our life.
At the conference you should wear formal dress but you are free to choose the colour or style.
At the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel. We have arranged some tours of the city. You will be visiting some interesting places and towers.
Although I have to admit that it is very tiring to visit the whole museum in one day, it is such a rewarding and enriching experience that people never get tired of looking at the paintings and sculptures in each section of the museum.
In reply to your letter, I will try to give you some advice.
For the conference, I suggest you wear a beautiful dress, because there will be important people from other colleges. At the end of the conference, all students and leaders will have a drink.
To finish, if you have spare time, you could walk in the centre of Poitiers which is very beautiful.
I look forward to meeting you at the conference.
What is impressive about this building is the number of tubes that you can see outside and inside the building.
In the Pompidou centre, there are different exhibitions on different themes. In general, there are paintings, videos and sculptures. These exhibitions are often very attractive and they change every year.
Another good point, if you go there you will have an extraordinary view over the city.
Concerning the hotel, the group has been booked to stay in a hotel which is very near the place where we are going to have the conference. The hotel is The Palace Hotel. It is  only 5 minutes' walk from there to the conference and I would like to suggest that this is the best way to get to the conference.
In my life the car has an enormous influence. I come from a rural area. The next city is 15 km away and there is no  bus  or rail connection to go there. It was quite hard for me not to have the  for my free time like my friends who lived in or near the city. I just had no way to meet them after school, because I had no vehicle to get there. I always needed my Mom or my Dad to take me where I wanted to go.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel, which is situated in the city centre,  15 minutes' walk from where the conference takes place . On the next page there is a map showing you the best way to get to the conference that will be at the Regional College.
There are a lot of places you can visit in Peterborough. We have a Cathedral you can visit anytime and the riverside, which is  best if it is a nice day, sunny and warm, for taking a walk. For  details, look at the map on the next page.
I have just received a letter from you. I  really appreciate your interest in our conference.
Firstly, the Palace hotel is your accommodation which you have booked. This is a very nice hotel and I am sure you will be very pleased about staying there.
Thirdly, we will have the end-of-conference party at 6 p.m. You can have dinner with wine which is very famous in our area and also you can enjoy the semi-classical concert which we have been preparing for 3 months. But I hope you will wear a formal suit and dress. You will not be allowed to enter this party unless you wear casual clothes. Lastly, you will not have any problem spending your extra time in Cambridge because we have a lot of attractions. Cambridge bus tour, for example, will be very nice  for you because it is the best and the easiest way of getting to know Cambridge. But if you do not like it, you can enjoy the City centre with a walking tour and then you can enjoy going punting which is the most pleasant attraction in Cambridge.
Finally, this area has its reputation for shopping centres, so it might be a good idea to buy some clothes, local food, and so on. You will be able to buy them at a  reasonable price.
It was found that the Amusement Centre is the most popular building in Seoul to enjoy yourself. There is a wide range of facilities including theatres, game centres, Korean restaurants. In particular,  people seemed to be satisfied with the theatres, because the screen is massive. The Korean restaurants appeared to be the most popular with foreigners.
It seems you can buy everything you want at a reasonable price in the building. In particular, Korean souvenir shops were felt to be extremely cheap. However, you can buy luxurious things as well if you wish.
First of all, we come to some important points about the organisation. The group has been booked into a comfortable and well-situated hotel, whose name is the "Palace Hotel". The hotel is on the right-hand side of  Parker Piece, which you can find on the map which I will send you. The "Palace Hotel" is 5 minutes' walk from the station. The conference is taking place in the building opposite the bus stop.
You asked me for some suggestions for your free afternoon. Naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something that is special is our cathedral. The architecture takes you back to the old times.  as well as the stained glass windows which are really amazing. We also have an interesting museum and a modern theatre.
First of all, the TV can bring us news in a short time, about what is happening all over the world. Another point in favour of  the TV is that it shows  interesting reports, for instance about animals or the different culture of other countries. Furthermore there are a lot of different programmes, usually something for everybody. It can also be relaxing to sit on the sofa after a busy day at work. Finally, the TV is in my opinion very useful for getting important information, you can watch the weather  and all of them are presented in wonderful colour.
About the end-of-conference party I can only say that a band will be playing the whole night, and a special guest, I still don't know who, will be expected. I suggest wearing casual clothes. I think there's no need for school uniforms.
The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell at the end of the 19th century. Nobody realized how important and how widespread an invention it would be in the future. Nowadays almost every household in the western world owns a telephone, and calling  relatives or friends spread all over the world is no strange thing. People need the telephone not only for chatting, but also for exchanging information in a very quick and direct way with the possibility of getting an answer immediately.
The events will take place at the Palace Hotel, the same hotel that you will be staying at. The Palace Hotel is opposite  Clifton Park, which is near the college. We chose that hotel because it is near the college and we don't need   transport. Because you know where the college is and you need to bring  some things from the college to the hotel, I think that it is better for all the group to come to the college and then we can all go together to the Palace Hotel. The conference starts at 9:00 o'clock, you need to be at the college half an hour before.
Concerning the end-of-conference party, I'm thinking about some dance and singing events. Let me know what you think. About the clothes that you need to wear, it must be your uniform, because it is the best conference in London and every year lecturers come from other colleges.
The telephone is a means of communication. If you want to talk to your friends, parents, or partner to ask something, you can call them without wondering how you can  communicate with them. Especially if some of your relatives or friends live in another country you can communicate with them  every day and you don't feel that they are far away from you.
Today, with the development of technology, the capabilities of the telephone have been improved. There are telephones that give you the opportunity to talk with more than one person on the line. Also you can leave a message if you call and can't reach someone. The latest type of telephone is the mobile phone. You can use it everywhere and  anytime.
Finally, if I were you I would go shopping in the City Centre in your last hours. However, if you're interested in archaeology you should visit the History Museum in Garden Square.
In the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their  car. It is said that the majority of  citizens have got a car and unfortunately this is the reason why cities are becoming more polluted.
On the other hand, this kind of  has made our life more comfortable and easier. In fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags. Cars are able to cover not only short distance but also can be used for long journeys. For example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
Pusan Castle is located in the South of Pusan. This is the biggest and oldest in Pusan. Historical things, pictures and clothes are exhibited there. It was built four hundred years ago. When you go up to the top of the castle, you can see the whole town, and there is a very big park in the Castle. Pusan Castle shows  Korean history from when one of our Kings made our country. etc. and there are a lot of facilities in Pusan Castle. A restaurant. A shop specially for groups. They can be given a discount. What is more, every place is explained in English. So you do not need , but, the entrance fee is a little expensive. It costs ten pounds. Fortunately if  over ten people visit the castle, they give them a discount.
In addition, the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in Mexico, for example, it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico. On the other hand it is far away from the city and it has  transport facilities.
Thank you for your letter. I am glad to help you with the organisation of the conference.
I phoned  the tourist information office last week and I got some information about the accommodation for the students.
As requested, the aim of this report is to assess the suitability for a group of American students of the visit to the Etruscan Museum.
2. After their visit to the Museum, they could enjoy the superb view of the sea and the Tuscan Archipelago, and they could have a picnic on the beach.
Your group has been booked into the Palace Hotel which is one of the most comfortable hotels in London. Personally, I am glad that you will have this opportunity to use its various facilities. It is located in the city centre and is about half an hour by underground from the conference. In my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Picadelly line. However you could take bus number 150, if you would like to have a look at the city centre and you also have some free time.
Basically, during three hours  in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London. However, you could take a long walk along the river to take some essential photos.
As far as I know,  the telephone was invented in the 19th century. It affected our lives very quickly, although there are some different means of communication such as TV, for instance. Since the Internet was introduced, many of us can't imagine  life without it. We have even been able to have our own telephone kept in our pocket for  some time.
The party will be  in the Palace Hotel. The Hotel is very close to the Town Hall. From Park Square, just go straight. You can see the sign for the hotel.
You can inform all the students that they can take some traditional food to the party. After the meal, you can play some games and prepare a prize for the winner. At the end of the conference you can dance and sing together.
These are my suggestions for this party. If you still have a problem, you can call me.
It is the main building of LUTON University in Park Square. It is an academic building. It includes a library, ,  rooms, a  and a restaurant.
There is a very big library. You can find any information from it that you want. For the rest of the time, you can go to the IT suite to use the Internet. If you feel hungry, you don't need to go out.  in the same building, you can find a restaurant.
I am writing with reference to your letter concerning the organization of an international student conference at Wimbledon Art College. Below I provide some information you asked about.
First of all, I would like to give you more information about the name and location of the hotel. The group has been booked into the "Maria Luisa" Hotel, which is situated in the centre of Wimbledon called Wimbledon Village. This hotel is the next building after the Art College, so it will be easy for your group to find the place.
Secondly turning to the end-of-conference party, it is meant to be on Wimbledon Common - a nice piece of English countryside. So, it may be a good idea to wear  very comfortable and informal clothes.
I look forward to meeting your group at our conference.
This building is situated on the magnificent bank of the Niva River with an excellent view of the Hermitage Museum.
In the Academy of Art you can find the oldest art library, with a wide range of books, and the Museum of Russian Art, with a huge collection of paintings, sculpture and architectural projects from the early eighteenth to late twentieth centuries. It is also a good opportunity to be introduced to the Russian system of art education.
The building of the Academy of Art in St Petersburg is worth visiting and interesting because of its historic and educational aspects.
About what you can do in the area in the free time you have, I would suggest you visit the Modern Art Museum which now has a new exhibition. Another suggestion could be to visit the zoo, or just walk through  Spring Gardens, which are beautiful at this time of the year.
Think about the people living at the time it was invented. It must have been such an exciting thing being able to talk to someone living thousands of miles away........ and now for us it is just as simple as dialling a number and talking to whoever we want to.
Regarding the end-of-conference party, we are going to have a dinner before the end and at the end we are going to take you to the Hotel. You need to wear an evening dress or suit and bow tie.
First of all, the BBC building is the news building of England. On the ground floor, they have  video cameras everywhere around the building and police officers walk around the building as well. On the first floor, they have a huge radio room, for sending and receiving  information from all over the world, because they have  small BBC buildings all over the world also; for Example, THAILAND, the United States of America, INDONESIA and CANADA.
The hotel which your students' group has been booked into is the Palace Hotel. It is fairly easy to get there from the conference. I would suggest you walk along New Street, which is the one next to the river, and in 10 minutes you will see the hotel on your right-hand side. The hotel is just opposite  the City Hospital.
As you possibly already know, the end-of-conference party will take place in the main reception room at the same hotel. You should be there by 7 o'clock in the evening. To answer your question, you should be fine wearing casual clothes. However, if you wish to dress smarter, there is no problem at all.
If we don't use them we suffer because of them. In my case I use public transport during the week to go to work but I could hardly imagine my weekends without my beloved car. I really need it to escape from the pollution, mainly caused by cars and  other four-wheel motor vehicles. Isn't that ironic? To go to the countryside and be able to breathe fresh, unpolluted air, I use my car, which, in my opinion, does not help to maintain a clean atmosphere at all.
Therefore I am thinking of selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places, and changed my life for a new life: without a car.
I am writing in response to your letter in order to give you some further information about the international student conference at our college.
I have just received your letter. It was very sad news about Richard Brown. I have given a lot of information about the international student conference.
Firstly, the conference will take place in the Palace Hotel and we get from our college to there by bus. Number 45 bus goes  there every 5 minutes. It takes 25 minutes, which is convenient for us. Secondly, there are some items on the programme that are  great. First of all, the conference's head makes a short speech and then we have dinner and drinks. Finally we enjoy a disco party so you should wear a suitable dress.
For the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel. Then we all set off to go on a sightseeing tour of Bromley town centre for about two hours before you leave for the airport. Bromley town centre is the most beautiful shopping centre in South East London. There are many historic buildings . I think the students will enjoy this sightseeing tour.
What a big person  Einstein was, who invented light. He created another day after sunset. People use it to do anything they want to do. We believe we can't live without light today, especially in the city . We have a long time to spend on our activities after the Sun goes to bed. We definitely need light to . I dare say, without light, our life would go into a dark, dark hell.
I am writing to you to answer your question about the conference in London. Thank you for your letter. I am very pleased to know you decided to come to the "Second International Conference on Human Rights" which will be held at Albert Hall College on  25  June.
I would like to inform you that the group you belong to has been booked into the Palace Hotel in the centre of London from the 24th of June until the 25th of June. The Albert Hall College, the building where the conference will be held is situated near Green Park Avenue. To get to it from the Palace Hotel, you can take the number 26 bus, otherwise, you can take the Picadilly Line from South Kensigton station to Green Park station. It takes about 10 minutes , that's the quickest means of transport you can choose. The Conference will start at 9 am on 25 June and will finish about 6 pm on the same day. During the day you are supposed to have a break of half an hour at 12 noon and finally, there will be a party for all the people who will be there. That will be a formal party and because of this, you will be required to be smartly dressed. Ladies should wear an evening dress and gentlemen a dark suit.
And if you climb to the top of the main tower - the keep - you will see unforgettable views of a white town. After that you can explore our great museum at the Old Castle. You will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armour and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
The kingdom Chosun has a history of 500 years and lasted until the beginning of the 20th century. Kyong Bok Palace was the main residence of the royal family, so you will be able to imagine its size.
As the kings of Chosun loved to be a part of  nature, the palace had a huge garden, however it was destroyed by the Japanese army, and now there remains only a part of the original palace. There is a special monument to the last queen of Chosun who was killed by the Japanese army.
The reason that this palace is also popular for the youngsters, who tend to dislike  historical visits, would be the various activities. You can try the traditional games of Korea and there is a chance to wear the traditional clothes of the Royals. Also there are performances which are held daily at the front gate of the palace.
I am writing in response to your letter where you asked me to give you more information about the international student conference and give some ideas and suggestions about what you and your students can do during your free time here.
Some people say that many  important inventions in our life are not so good and useful as we have got used to thinking them. First of all they talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create,  and some other problems. But in my opinion if people's inventions have a place in our lives they are  then. I think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you  to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (I am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through  choice). Computers make everything much faster so everything is now based on computer systems. The electric lamp was an important invention a hundred years ago (at that time it was like a revolution). I think it wouldn't be possible for us to survive without  electric light. Because of shipbuilding developments people were able to make all those geographical discoveries, and   is an undeniable necessity in our life.
I have just read your letter and I am happy to help by giving you some further information.
As you were informed, there will be a party for all participants of the conference, which will take place afterwards in the hotel restaurant. Bearing in mind the fact that it will be a purely social occasion, I believe that casual clothes are the most suitable option for this event.
SUBJECT: Recommendations for a place to visit
The aim of this report is to give a description and make a recommendation concerning the most interesting building in the town.
. Inside the Palace, there is a museum with a collection of antique porcelain.
I am replying to your letter concerning the help you need. I am pleased to provide the information  you need for the group.
The hotel I  booked is the Palace Hotel which is in the centre of London just two blocks from Victoria station. I think it is very convenient for the group. You know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. About the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. The rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting  good value. And the best way to get to the College for the conference is to walk to  Victoria station, get the tram to Glouster Road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the College. However I am going to make a plan for each student with all of the details and the address.
About the party at the end of conference, we are organising it in the same hotel which has a nice . It will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place. We'll have food and drink and music for dancing. It is not a formal party so I think it is fine to wear something not too formal.
The computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started  processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small hole and each hole meant something   like a code. The machine that was used for reading this card was very big, you used to need a room  for the computer. I remember when I had the first lesson at the University and the teacher took us to the Computer Centre and I saw these machines, all my colleagues and I were laughing  was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
But the computer has a bad side too.  each day we depend more and more on it. So I feel scared when I think about the consequences if some of the viruses  or mad people misuse  as happens these days with  sex or other . I work with children and the computer helps me in my job but affects it too.
At the event, I'd like you to give us a speech. You can tell us about whatever you like. For example, a speech about your latest work would be very nice. I'm planning the event for 15 or 22 February, from 7 to 8 p.m. Please tell me which day is good for you. After the event, I'd like to offer you  dinner at a Japanese restaurant near our college.
The party was far beyond my expectations. Twenty people from five different countries celebrated with me. I had never felt happier.
To reply to your question, it was really a nice experience. As you know, I like  pop music so much and the singer was one of my favourite singers. Also, in the future I want to be an organizer like at this concert, so it'll be useful  experience for me.
At the pop concert, there were many people, so before starting the pop concert, I arranged the seats and carried some musical instruments. It was somewhat hard for me. After the concert, I cleaned all the ground with other helpers and we moved the seats again.
Thank you for your letter. I am writing to give you some advice about the international student conference.
M. Brown has booked rooms in the Palace Hotel. This is a first-class hotel. The easiest way to get from the hotel to the conference is by  bus. There is a bus stop in front of your hotel. Take the bus in the direction of the centre of town. After four stops, get off the bus. The name of this bus stop is 'Kongresshaus'. When you get off the bus, the conference is in the building across the road. You can't miss it.
Afterwards we will eat together in a restaurant and we will go to a disco. For the disco, you mustn't wear blue jeans.
Finally, on your last day, I suggest you do a sightseeing tour in our town. It takes you two hours. Afterwards you will have some time to buy some souvenirs from Switzerland. If you have any more questions, write back to me.
Before the time of computers, people had to write a whole letter every time . When they wanted to correct a word, they had to write the whole letter again. With the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. We save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
I work in a bank and I work all day with computers. If we hadn't any , we would have to write all the transactions on paper.
I'm pleased to be able to help you with the international student conference.
The hotel into which the group has been booked  is the Palace Hotel, which is situated near the big bridge of Mont Blanc.
I would be pleased to help you with all your questions and I will provide you with the information which you need as far as I can.
Imagine life without a phone. You are on the road, you have a car accident. What are you going to do without a phone? In another situation, your son is ill, he needs help urgently. I am sure the phone has saved many lives. Besides, it is always very nice to ring your friend or mum, only  to chat . Thanks to the phone, it is possible to speak to your mum even when she is at the other end of the Earth.
I am writing with reference to your article which I read in a local newspaper two days ago. As I took part in this activities weekend, which was organised by the college, I would like to express my dissatisfaction with your article.
If I were in your shoes, I would choose the position in the museum because it is more stimulating and as the pay is about the same, I think that this choice is the best for you. But you should consider which workplace is more convenient for you. You'd do better not to travel far away from your home. Also working in a museum may include big tips from the tourists. Apart from this, despite the fact that it is a summer job, you could be employed for the whole of next year, if you are lucky.
The end-of-conference party is to be held in the 'Royal Room' of the hotel, which has an outstanding reputation for its quality and seriousness. Therefore, all the guests will be asked to wear the appropriate clothes in order to be .
The technological revolution taking place today can be directly linked to the amazing evolution of our communications technology over the last few years. The inevitable invention symbolizing this aspect in our daily life is, of course, the mobile phone.
I really enjoy riding my motorcycle. People say that it is dangerous; I don't think so. When I ride it is only me and my motorcycle. In front of me and behind are my friends, who I like and trust. And around me is the countryside, which I can  and enjoy while we look for a camp. We can go to any place we like, avoiding traffic and  crowded buses and trains, etc.
I am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world. I feel very bad about the fact that I don't know who it was. On the other hand  because that invention has changed and affected my life and the people I care about; it has affected my life in the very best way.
The end-of-conference party is designed to give a taste of many different cultures. So you will enjoy traditional foods, music, dances and games from all over the world. As a part of this, the leader of each group has to wear the national dress of her country. Other members of the groups can wear  normal, attractive formal dress.
I have included a local map. There are some  on the back of the map. Please let me know if you would like to book one of the city-walk tours. We have arranged special discounts for the conference attendees. Personally I recommend the Dickens tour because it is a good length  walk and very historical.
There are two parts of Liverpool Street Station that make it so interesting a building. The newly decorated section is fairly modern in style with escalators and touch-screen ticket machines. It is also very well linked to the old underground station, which  is such a contrast in . The old bit is rather unique and charming. You can really imagine what it looked like in the old days.
There is another surprising section in this building. At the far side of the station it is  connected to a spacious, well-designed public park. It is a good example of  great architecture that was designed to provide services for the public.
First of all, I would like to travel only in July because I am employed and will be able to finish my contract in June. In August I am going to apply for a new job.
The aim of this report is to summarize the pupil's attitudes to the video they have to make and to suggest which lessons and other activities should be filmed. The report is based on the opinions of more than 300 pupils.
Thank you for your letter dated 8 June 2001. I hope I can give you the information you need, so the conference will be a great experience for you and your group.
Your group will stay at the Palace Hotel. The Palace Hotel is situated in the town centre next to the railway station. A free shuttle bus takes you to the conference centre. The bus leaves at 8 a.m. from the front entrance of the hotel.
The end-of-conference party is  in a tent and in the grounds. There will be a barbecue, a place to dance and much more. It will be a surprise! I suggest that you wear leisure clothes for the party.
Your group is staying at the Palace Hotel, which is located directly opposite the bus station.
Before your departure, you will have time to visit the Olympic Museum or to do a sightseeing tour of our city.
The museum is located in Ouchy, opposite the "Delamuraz Hotel". It is close to the main road, and  300 metres from the station.
When you are inside the museum, you will be impressed by the paintings on the walls. They were all painted during the war by nurses. If you go down a few steps, you will discover the cellar. Everything in this room is connected with wine.
Last but not least I will give you some ideas about where to spend your free afternoon. I'd suggest you visit our local museum, as there is a marvellous exhibition there at the moment. Provided the weather is fine, you could also go swimming or make a tour of our beautiful town. (I could book a guide for you if you're interested.)
The industrial countries have encountered great change in their structures since the car has been made available to everyone.
At the beginning of the last century only a few very rich people could afford a car; it was a kind of leisure or sport to drive one. Today almost everyone owns a car and needs it for daily activities. The transport network has changed in accordance with this social evolution.
Welcome to London. You asked me about an interesting building to visit. , I recommend the British Museum. One of the reasons is you can learn almost everything about British history there.
The museum looks very old, like some other buildings in London, but it is very modern inside. After going through the enormous main door, you can see a huge round white building, which is a library. A lot of famous people have been to this library !
The British Hall is on the first floor, not far from the library. It shows a large number of valuable things. Almost every one tells you a story or gives you a picture of British history. I'm sure all the students will gain a wonderful !
Firstly, the hotel which has been booked for you is Palace Hotel which is located close to the conference. In order to get from the hotel to the conference, you just need to take the bus we will provide. Secondly, the end-of-conference party will take place in the same hall as the conference at 6 p.m., which includes dinner and an announcement by the president of the conference. The party is arranged as a casual party, therefore, you can wear comfortable clothes. You can expect to meet many students from other schools as well. Finally, if you want to have an exciting experience  here, I strongly suggest that you go to the musicals. As you may have heard, our city is well known for the musicals. Or, if you want to relax, you can take a walk in the park situated at ten minutes' distance on foot from the hotel. Whatever you choose, you will be satisfied with your choice.
I am very glad to help you with the International Student Conference. I hope that our friend Richard Brown doesn't have any serious illnesses.
, where is the conference? This will be in the Casino Hotel and we don't need to worry about the best way to get there because  all the main routes in Devonport have signs that show the correct way to this popular hotel.
After  the conference, there is a party in the same hotel. At this party, there will be some food, soft drinks, music and a special place for dancing. This party is for the students so the  clothes won't be so formal.
On the free day before catching our plane, we can choose between two options  our free time. One is a guided tour of the city centre, and another is visiting the chocolate factory.
Please, if you have any more questions, please call me on 38755980.
Thanks for your last letter and I am sorry about not giving you enough information.
We have already booked a 4-star hotel - the Palace Hotel, which is near the River Thames, in Walton-on-Thames. It is not far away from the station so we will go there by train. The end-of-conference party will be held in an Indian restaurant, which is next to the hotel. It is supposed to be  from 7 pm to 11 pm. Also there are some competitions and exciting games after dinner and a disco is also provided. You can wear anything you like. We would like you just to be yourself and have fun.
Secondly, in some ways, it can educate young children. Many TV programmes are specially made for children, such as "Learn Follow Me" and "Be Good to Others". Actually, they are quite good programmes and helped me learn what I should do generally or how to behave well when I was still a child.
Thank you for your letter about the international student conference. Here are the answers to your questions.
You will stay in the Palace Hotel, which is situated opposite the railway station, Camberley. To get to the conference, you catch the No.7 coach from the station and get off at the Camberley College bus stop. It takes 5 minutes from the station. When you get here, just turn to the left and you will find the stadium where the conference will be held.
The end-of-conference party will be held in the cafeteria in the college, which is next to the stadium. It starts at 6 p.m. and ends at 10 pm. We will prepare traditional English meals and some students from foreign countries will prepare their ethnic foods.
The ghost story may not be true, but it has good furniture from the 16th century, and the castle itself is very beautiful. I think it is worthwhile seeing it.
Furthermore I am really keen on swimming and can therefore hardly wait to have the opportunity to learn the butterfly as a new style since I am already perfect at the crawl.
But the cherry on the cake was that I met one of the handsome singers backstage! He asked me what I was doing and so on and finally invited me to his next concert! Of course I agreed - I wouldn't want to miss the chance to gain experience while having fun! Perhaps I could help regularly in the lighting area - it would help me with my photography studies. What do you reckon?
I received your letter this morning. I am sorry to hear that Richard is ill and is unable to attend the conference; I am glad that you are able to be the leader of the group. I hope that the information below is very useful to you, during your attendance at the conference.
I have booked a hotel not far  from our school. The hotel is called the Epsom Down Hotel. Your plane will arrive in England by 9:00. There will be a coach waiting for you, and the driver will be next to the information desk. You should arrive at the hotel by 11:00. You will then have an hour to check in and unpack all your luggage. The conference will start on time at 12:30, so I would suggest you leave the hotel by 12:00. The best way to get to the conference is to follow  the college road and turn left toward the end. You then keep going straight. You will eventually see the main entrance to the college. When you get into the college you can just ask any boys in the college where to go from then. They all know where the conference is and when.
At the end of the conference, we will have a party. The party is to let all the students get to know each other better. The party will be in the dance hall next to the conference room. I would suggest they wear formal clothing, such as tie, trousers and blazer.
After the conference, we are going to stay in the Palace Hotel but instead of staying in the conference room, we are going to move to the reception room where a dinner will be served for us. Afterwards, a live band is going to play for the rest of the night. Regarding the clothes, you have to wear something smart and classic.
The Olympic Museum is situated near the lake and offers, for the tourist, an unbelievable view of the mountains and the lake. But also the museum has a lot of gardens with several statues. Also, the architecture of the building is beautiful and very modern. First of all, the main interest of the museum is  Olympic history. You can find a lot of documents about it and you have several . In addition, you can play  several interactive games and learn about the rules of the Olympic games.
REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATION.
I want to apologise to you, because I haven't written to you recently, but I want to tell you what happened to me   last week. I had the opportunity to help at one of the most  pop concerts in my city. So imagine, I felt really really good and excited.  I don't have words  to describe it but I will try to do it, OK?
They needed one girl to do the make-up of the stars of the group, so I did it. I was talking with the manager and the people in the group so I met a lot of people and that's good for my curriculum vitae . But the best it for me  was when one of the group !
I'm so happy to help you with this international student conference. I'm sorry to hear about Richard. Could you please give him my best wishes for his health? I'm sure that you can perfectly replace him to lead your group.
These days, the castle is being , so there is a lot of construction machinery around it. That's not a big problem because there is a complete museum inside it where you can see old pictures of the castle over the centuries. There are a lot of old items that were in the King's family.
First of all, we have already booked the Five-Star Hotel for your group. It is a modern hotel, near our college, and it is also very convenient for the airport. You can take either  bus or taxies. The number 101 bus leaves from the airport, then you can get off at the "city college" stop. It would be a great chance for everyone to attend the party. This is just a relaxing party, just so the members have a chance to relax and make friends. So I think you'd better wear a dress.
First of all, in my opinion, TV has a great educational function, and it also makes the world  smaller. You can just sit at home and you can know what is happening all over the world at that moment. I would rather watch the news on TV instead of reading a newspaper or listening to the radio because the news on TV is .
The group has been booked into the King Hotel on High Street, which is very easy to find. And the best way to get from there to the conference is by following the road in front of the hotel to the right, then cross the zebra crossing to the opposite side. After that walk to the right about 15 metres and you will find the conference venue, which is called the White House.
Finally, on the last day you could spend your free time visiting our town hall where you will be able to learn more about my area - or you could do some shopping on High Street.
But in my opinion it would be nice for the students to come and see this building, because they will be able to learn and compare the place with their country. As Wales is not modern like America,  the students will probably get an interest in looking  at  old things.
The best way to get there is to take the number 7 bus. The bus stop is opposite the entrance of the hotel. You will get off the bus at "Royal Gardens". Turn left and go straight along "Baker Street". At the end of this street there is a house, number 18. This is our college.
You wish to know all about the end-of-conference party. As far as I can see, there will be only a little dinner and a group of young singers will  us with their songs.
Finally I will give you some advice about what you could do for about three hours.
There are a lot of advantages to it.
Firstly, people are able to talk to a person at any time, be it just for fun or  to discuss some important and relevant things. Moreover we can always call the police, the hospital or a doctor for help. This could save your life!
The hotel is near the station and is called "Grand Placad". When you arrive you take the train to Guildford and after that you just have to cross the road in front of the station.
In this area there are a lot of things you can see and some interesting buildings to visit. The best building you must see is the cathedral. It is the most important church in this area because of its architecture.
It is built on the top of the hill and around it there is only a huge field. You can walk there because the bus stops just at the bottom of the hill.
If you are interested in more modern buildings I  suggest you visit "Caldea", which is a very modern  centre with  beautiful architecture.
My name is Manu Roddos and I am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show Over the Rainbow, which took place in your establishment, The Circle Theatre, which made me feel very upset.
First of all, the show is far away from being the best musical show in London. I was very excited to see it yesterday, but as soon as I arrived at the theatre the problems began. I was looking forward to getting a discount of several pounds on my ticket, as the leaflet promises, however, it did not happen. After that, I became even more angry because, as far as I am concerned, the show must begin on time, but it started forty-five minutes late. Finally, the actors were not Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but others I have never seen before, and the restaurant was closed with no notice.
Firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the Internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
It is very kind of you to give me the chance to do two activities while I am at the Camp. I'd like to do climbing and sailing. Actually I am quite good at climbing. I often go climbing in my town. As for sailing, well, I haven't tried it before. That is why I want to have a go. I think it must be fun.
I hope this letter will help you with organizing the festival.
In our school we have the following rules: 1. Every pupil has to sit alone. (I mean that one desk is given to one person.)
As far as I am concerned, I enjoy reading all kinds of fiction  as each masterpiece is unique in its own way regardless of  what sort of book it is. Stories that are realistic help us to understand our own life and the people around us better. However, reading an unusual, sometimes fantastical story we could dream about fairy lands and observe our world from another point of view. I consider "Wuthering Heights" by Emily BrontÃ« to be one of the books that wash away from the soul the dust of our everyday routine. It is a remarkable piece of literature, which portrays deep feelings of love and hate, depicts strong and unique characters, and reveals eternal concerns with good and bad, life and death. This book is both realistic and unusual and in my opinion this is the core of its originality. It contributes to the world's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination.
I would like to travel only in July because my boss cannot give me any leave for the other months in summer.
Then you ask me which two activities I want to choose. To tell you the truth, I would prefer to do swimming and singing. I'm good at both of these. I have been swimming for eight years! Also I like music a lot and everybody tells me that I have a good voice.
The concert lasted for hours and at the end they wanted to pay me. I didn't want to take any money because I was so happy that I had seen the Savage Garden concert  live and because that night was the best of my life.
As regards when I would like to travel, I would like to make you aware that I can only travel in July because I am really tied up at this time owing to the exam period, which will last until the end of June.
There are many activities that  could be filmed. We can film our Swimming pool, . It is clean, neat and tidy with helpful staff. The gym is a good choice for filming with the sophisticated equipment that you have. In addition, we can film the library, which possesses thousand of works, books on various subjects, with up-to-date facilities such as computers, the Internet, CDs and cassettes.
First, I'd like to travel in July because my friend, who is French, is coming to Toronto in August. Therefore, I'd like to show her around and spend time with her as much as possible.
Second, I prefer log cabins to tents. The reason is that the camp will be two weeks and log cabins are more comfortable than tents. However, if the log cabins are not available at the moment, I can stay in the tents.
Anyway, by the time we finished everything, thousands of fans came into this concert hall. Everybody looked very excited about the concert.
"Wuthering Heights" by Emile BrÃ¶nte I think this statement is a very accurate summary in the case of my book because the main character in the story is a very wicked man. Besides that, this character is more interesting than the others due to his complex mind and his deep, evil ways. He's the richest character of all, his name is Heathcliff, and he's the reason for whatever happens to the other characters. They are always suffering from the vengeance that Heathcliff is sworn to, the cause of which is the miserable situation the other characters have put him in. From this point of view I think Heathcliff shouldn't be hated for his bad temper. He's not good not because he was born with this tendency to harm but because the other characters have made him like that. This revenge links the story together so without it we would not have such "Wuthering Heights". I sympathize with Heathcliff because I think every bad character is a very important aspect of every book, film or play and if they were missing we would not love those stories we enjoyed while we were reading them.
I am keen on photography so I would love to participate in this activity. I am very good at it and it would be a pleasure for me to help the others. I will also take painting, because I always dream about painting, but I never try to, so I think it is a good opportunity.
As you know, last month I worked at a pop concert and I enjoyed it a lot.
First I had to make the backdrop for the stage, so I made  the background a sky with a lot of bright stars. Then I put in some blue lights. Furthermore I made some stars out of silver-coloured paper. But that was only the beginning of my adventure.
When the play finally started, and the two actors entered the stage, I could see that the male one was not Danny Brook, contrary to what the advertisement  says, which really disappointed me since he was the only reason that I came to this play.
So, unfortunately, I must say that last night was one of the worst nights I ever had, and having given the reasons, I expect to be able to count on your sense of responsibility, so, I feel that I must ask for my 20 pounds I spent on that terrible night.
So, men have invented machines to help them with their tasks, but nowadays, we are becoming slaves to . The most important thing in the future will be knowing how to deal with machines, so, today's children must be introduced to computers from an early age, so that they can have a chance to compete with the furious  of the future.
I am writing to complain about the musical show "over the rainbow". I recently booked a week's holiday in London, to see the musical "over the rainbow", the date was the 9th of June 2000, with your firm.
We arrived at the theatre at 19,00 since the play was supposed to start at 19:30 but we had to wait until 20:15 before it started. It was also said that discounts were available but this was wrong, because we couldn't get any discounts.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. How could she manage to keep quiet about this? This was the best thing that had ever happened to  the Fennall family for yeats.
Maria was still a little bit shocked by the news that she would be having a baby. She and her husband Peter had been trying for so long and now they had succeeded.
It happened to me once.  I wanted to go on holiday, so I went to the travel agency. In the window there were some good advertisements about holidays which were very cheap. I really liked one of them concerning a holiday in Spain for 3 days with hotel and breakfast included, for only Â£250. I went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, I went to many shops just to get the same answer. None of the adverts in the windows were available. However, the most important thing is when I asked them to take that advert out of the window they didn't do it.
I WAS PART OF THE STAFF. WE ALL HAD A SPECIAL PASS  AND THEY ALSO GAVE US A T-SHIRT AND A CAP (I'VE GOT AN EXTRA ONE FOR YOU); OUR WORK STARTED TWO DAYS BEFORE THE CONCERT, AND I MUST SAY IT WAS REALLY HARD, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE WORKED IN THE SUN, FROM 8.00 A.M TO 8.00P.M. WITH AN HOUR'S BREAK FOR LUNCH AND IT WAS THE SAME AFTER THE CONCERT.
I'm writing  to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when I would like to travel, I would like to go anytime during July, because I have to be back home in August, because I need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
And referring to the question about which type of accommodation I prefer, I choose a log cabin, because I think that a tent is messier, so I would appreciate it if you give me a cabin. And my answer to the question about which activities I would like to choose, well I choose swimming, because it is my daily exercise, and surfing. Anyway I'm not very good at surfing but with a little bit of help I know I can do it.
Oh,  last I just would like to ask you how much clothing and money I have to bring with me. And well, Mrs Helen, I would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions.
Well here in Dublin things are still the same, but I think somebody told you that I went to the Moby concert here at the Point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. I guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? Well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so I went to help them and everything else, and when I got to the Point, do you know who was there? Can you believe it, it was Moby. So I went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'Would you give me a hand with my decks?'  So I went, and when we finished he gave me a T-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. Oh my God, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. Well Kim, I hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.
This show was very disappointing for me for many reasons. First of all, I was very surprised by the absence of the famous actor, Danny Brook, who was one of my reasons for booking a seat. Also, I'm unhappy about the inaccurate information in your advertisement, which clearly says the play begins at 19.30, instead of 20.15 like my evening's show. At the end of show, unfortunately for me and the other spectators, the worst thing happened: the theatre's restaurant was closed without any reasons being given and nobody came to us to apologise or advise us about another restaurant open late at  night.
That's why, in response to all these problems, I'm asking you to give back some money. I'm looking forward to having an answer from you.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. That's why all his friends were angry with him and left him alone. It was clear that Pat had to change and show  his friends that they could believe in him thoroughly. For those next few days, Pat would do his best to be as sympathetic as possible. To begin with, every morning Pat said a pleasant "hello" and added to that a big smile. His mother always says: "If you are smiling and are nice to  people,  people will be nice and will smile at you". As Pat always does what his mother says his friends began to play with him again, but not just his old friends, everybody wanted to play with him. The moral of the story here is very clear: be nice to  people and  people will respect you and will appreciate you as a friend.
To  answer your question about living in tents or cabins, I would like to sleep in a tent. A cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable. That isn't what I want to have if I stay in a wild area.
Yes, I have some questions about clothes. What should I take with me and how much money will I need?
I hope I was able to answer your questions and you will perhaps soon give me a reply to my ones.
First I arrived really early in the morning at the place, but the people were just working and I joined them. My duty was to  the spot lights on the right places, but it wasn't very easy. You always had some problems  like not having enough wire or the lamps being broken by the transport. The experience that I had was that I had never worked in such a perfect team. I was able to ask anybody, and he answered in detail, although he had a lot of work.
And according to your advertisement, the show should have started at 19.30 but it didn't. It was 45 minutes late! And also I couldn't buy tickets with my credit card but on the advertisement it said 'discounts available'. I was really annoyed by that!
We started to go out at the same time as I started to change my mind. I don't want to go back to  heaven anymore as long as I am with him.
I am writing to reply to your letter about the competition.
While I will be at the Camp I would like sailing, because it is my favourite sport. I am good at it - I have been sailing since childhood. The second activity which I would like to do is surfing - I have never done it.
Thise book is about a man who knows that he will die soon, he knows that he didn't make his dream come true. So he decided to go for a last trip in his life. His goal is to get a Marlin. He is very old, and he isn't so strong as he should be. He needs to rest, but he doesn't give up. In the end he makes his dreams come true, he catches a vast Marlin.
In answer to your letter, I would like to travel in July for two reasons. One's  because I  will have finished my exams by that time and the other is that in the first two weeks of that month I will go to Farnborought  the Air show and the delegation from my country will be there.
I think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after  shopping.
People in general have a compulsion   to shop, in my opinion. Because sometimes the article being bought is not really necessary. We must accept that the media have an important effect on our lives, especially the T.V.
I think in the near future we need to decide with the government which  special place in the town  will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
But the play started forty-five minutes late, and the star of the show, of whom I'm a great fan  who was the main reason for why I decided to see the play, had been changed for another actor, who turned out to be really bad.
I think that some of the changes have been very good, like the improvement in  medical science, which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.
Concerning the activities that you have listed , some of  them I am really interested in , especially painting. Since I was young, my dad  has always taken me to life drawing, so now it has become one of my hobbies. And I think it will be nice to draw  beautiful landscapes of the place. Beside drawing, swimming is my favourite as well. When I was in high school, I joined  the swimming club. And I also participated in a few swimming competitions. Although I'm not the best,  I have a lot of confidence at it.
I agree! Sometimes shopping is not always enjoyable. Most  people might think, why would I say that? because shopping is a very good entertainment, especially for women, like me.
- Activities: during my stay I would like to do swimming and surfing. I know it will be hot there and California is famous for its beaches. I am a good swimmer and hope to improve my swimming style, too. On the other hand I have no experience of surfing - I am an absolute beginner with high motivation.
In this context, shopping means a compulsory exercise you have to do regularly and frequently. It is not enjoyable if you look on it as a duty. But if you realize how important  what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consciousness and more joy than before. 'Shopping' could be annoying if you look on it as a waste of time because you do it every day. Reorganize your approach to shopping and plan to keep food in stock! Try the Internet and use e-business and online shopping to order your pants for example.
This is even a good way to get around the unfriendly service you get to know if you have to buy something in a shop right before closing time. Choose your clothes at home before you order them by e-mail! Another way to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop.
You have been presented with some reasons why shopping is not always enjoyable. There are ways of making it more fun. It depends on every individual to change your mind and behave like a 'smart' shopper.
Recently I have been interested in musical shows, because I have never seen them in my country. When I saw your advertisement for the show, it was so attractive to me. So I went to London to see the show.
 As an advantage, the modern technology is developing toward convenience for humans.
So, you can contact other people with a mobile phone no matter where you are and you can correspond with people in other countries in real time by using the Internet. How incredible it is!
I hope I'll be able to travel in July, due to the fact that my children have summer holiday from July. I prefer to stay in log cabins , because I'm going to travel with 2 children and my dog. I wonder if I can take them as well. Then I'd like to join the activities, swimming and Singing. I love swimming and also I've got a scuba diving licence. I used to enjoy floating on the water whenever I was on holiday. Singing is the most favourite hobby for us. We often go out to sing in a Karaoke bar.
I am writing to complain about your advertisement concerning the Musical show: "Over the rainbow". First of all, according to your advertisement, Danny Brook should have been one of the stars, instead there was a, to me, totally unknown actor. To make matters worse the musical started almost one hour later than it was supposed to start.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. It didn't take long  for my embarrassing story to get out in the open. I asked myself how I could be so stupid, telling her my secret after all I had been going through to keep it to myself. But now  the story was out, I just started to accept it. Maybe it wasn't so bad after all? All of a sudden I started to believe that this was the best solution of all. Now I didn't need to go around  worrying about it anymore. At once I felt more assertive and a big smile appeared on my face. I decided to thank Pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lesson.
Firstly, your advertisement said there were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove, but it had different actors to my disappointment. Secondly, it said the show started at 19:30, but it was delayed until 20:15. I had to wait 45 minutes, wasting time.
Thirdly, tickets were Â£10, Â£15 and Â£20, and I knew that these were available on discount, following the advertisement. But it was impossible.
In the hope that you understand me.
It was a very unpleasant evening. First of all, it had said in the advertisement that Danny Brook was starring in this show. But someone else performed instead of him. The other actor was very disappointing.
My day, for example, begins with a lot of noise. The alarm on my radio wakes me up at half past six.
After breakfast I have to use my car to get to school. Without my car I would always arrive late. At school the computer has become an important new tool. I use it to , to print some pictures or to surf  the Internet. After school I relax in front of the TV and talk a lot with my friends on the telephone.
I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A MUSICAL  THAT IS TAKING PLACE AT THE CIRCLE THEATRE. I WAS WORRIED WHEN I SAW THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR THE MUSICAL IN A NEWSPAPER ON SUNDAY.
THE FIRST PROBLEM WAS WHEN I READ WHO WAS STARRING. IT SAID: 'DANNY BROOK'. BUT, WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE PLAY, I REALISED THAT IT WAS A DIFFERENT ACTOR AND, REALLY, I WAS DISAPPOINTED. ANOTHER PROBLEM WAS THE TIME THAT I HAD TO WAIT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AT 19.30 AND I WAITED FOR FORTY-FIVE MINUTES!! BESIDES THIS, I COULD NOT GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE THEATRE BECAUSE IT WAS CLOSED. IN ADDITION TO THIS, I DID NOT HAVE ANY DISCOUNT ON MY TICKET. SO, I HAD TO PAY A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A PLAY THAT WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER.
NOWADAYS, PEOPLE ALWAYS SEEM TO BE WORRIED. ALL THE TIME THEY ARE ASKING WHAT  THEY LOOK LIKE AND THEY WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON CLOTHES.
It was a strange experience because it's something new to me. I had never even gone to a concert before. I even got the chance to take some photographs of ricky Martin with my sister and I've got one photo of him with me!!
If I have to find  a timetable, it is very useful to have the opportunity to see them on the Internet, besides, it is the quickest way! In the beginning, I wasted a lot of time getting some information I needed because I didn't know exactly where I had to look for it. But after a while you gain experience and you soon get used to this kind of research.
As I have explained, it was not the perfect evening that I expected to have and I would like to have my money back for the reasons that I mentioned above.
After 3 weeks, Maria got ill so she was not able to go to school. All her friends phoned her every day, except Pat, the only friend that Maria really loved. Despite that, she was not sad. One day, when Maria was sitting in her bedroom, someone knocked on the door. It was Manuel. He was worried about her. Maria was nervous, but, for the first time, she could talk to him as she never had before, and at the end of the day, she was the happiest person in the world. She had her first kiss and she had Pat's friendship back; after all, everything happened because of her.
About the accommodation, from the two options, I choose to sleep in a tent, because I think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
Do you remember that I had to help at a pop concert? Well the concert was Friday night and I went there with the Red Cross volunteers. Did you know I'm one of them?
There I was impressed by how a singer can cause such hysteria in  teenagers. During the two-hour concert we had to attend to thirty-six people who became unconscious after being trapped in the first row by the other people. Can you imagine? Thirty-six people in two hours! If you have to help at a concert avoid it if you can. It's the best thing you can do .
First of all you asked when I would be able to travel. You ought to know that it is possible for me to go there only in July because I'm going to work the whole of August.
Don't hesitate to contact me with any more questions.
On the other, you have always to count on unfriendly shop assistants, not having the size for you or too high prices.
Yesterday I went to "The Circle Theatre" to see the musical show "OVER THE RAINBOW". I'm very disappointed with this evening. The first thing was that it started 45 minutes late. And when it finally started, it wasn't Danny Brook who performed. There was a different actor and he was really bad. You should have informed us before that you'd changed the actor. On the advertisement you wrote that discounts are available but they weren't. After the show I wanted to drink something in your theatre restaurant but when I arrived it was closed because the show started too late! I'm so disappointed! I wanted to have a pleasant evening while I'm here in London for a week's holiday. So I ask you sincerely for my money back because it wasn't a perfect evening out.
However, there are many other interesting places and exhibitions to see in London. For example, at the time of our visit there is going to be "The London Fashion and Leisure Show". It is a coincidence which we would be extremely happy to take advantage of. This is a great opportunity for us to see the latest fashions and famous fashion models who we would like to have autographs from.
Famous people are living creatures. They breathe, eat, feel and aside from the fact that they are famous they are just the same as anyone else.
I have just received your letter telling me I have won the first prize in your competition, and I am glad about it. I am writing to give the information you asked me for and also I would like to request some information about the prize.
First of all I want to let you know I could travel only in July because it is the month that I have holidays from my school. Furthermore I would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because I think it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the environment.
Dear Kim: I am sorry, I haven't written to you sooner but I am still excited about the experience I had helping Will Smith on the freeway  last month. Anyway, now I am going to tell you everything about it.
As you know, I have always taken the freeway on Sundays to go to my grandparents' house, but that Sunday I was driving when suddenly I saw in the lay-by one excellent car. It was a Jaguar with Will Smith in it. I stopped and I was going to ask if he needed some help and he said, "Of course".
He had a puncture  and he didn't know how to repair it. Then I changed the tyre and during this time he was asking me about my hobbies, studies, everything. He was really kind and friendly but really what I really enjoyed most about it was when he invited me out that night for a drink at the most luxurious pub I have ever been to. Can you believe my luck?
My name is ... Two weeks ago my family and I visited London. During our stay we saw a  advertisement for your theatre and decided to see this latest and best musical show (as it said in your advertisement). Actually, I must say that it wasn't our perfect evening out!
They ignored me. We bought tickets without a discount. I don't know whether they offered a discount to somebody else or not.
I had always wanted to be a theatre actress. I saved my pocket money to go to the theatre  age of 15. During  those years I had met  Zuhal Olcoy. I had seen her every morning when I was going to school. Despite  the fact that going to school by bus was easier than going by bicycle, I had preferred  going to school by bicycle to going by bus. In that way I was able to see her every morning. The more I saw her, the more determined I became. At last I met  her. She invited me to her play at the theatre. When I went  to see her play, I  really would love to be an actress. She was the only person who encouraged me to be an actress.
I am writing to inform you that I would like to travel in July. The reason is that I am a full-time student at Cracow University and I have many exams at the end of the semester, which is in June. I hope that it is not a problem.
From the list of all the activities I have chosen photography and golf. Since secondary school I have been very interested in taking pictures and I have  broad experience of it. I have chosen golf because I have never played  this game.
Please, send me any information about what I should take with me. Should I bring my camera, warm clothes or any pocket money? I am waiting for your reply.
My friend offered me a job as a member of the technical staff at Sting's concert. I love his music and I collect his albums so I was very happy that I helped his crew.
I'd like to write about rules in Poland. They're horrible. There are many things we aren't allowed to do at school. First of all - we have to be on time. Our lessons start at 8 am and we aren't allowed to be late. We have to change our shoes. Fortunately we don't have to wear  school uniforms. We can wear what we want. Most  students wear jeans and a sweater. We have to be quiet during  lessons and our lessons are boring because of it. Our school bags are very heavy because we have to carry our books, notebooks, atlases and dictionaries all day. This is what I'd like to change. I'd like to leave my books at school. At home we have to do our homework. There's always much to do so we have no free time at all. Our parents want us to be clever. When we get good marks at school they let us go out (to the disco or cinema, but only on Saturdays and we have to be back by ten). On Sundays we have to go to bed early because on Monday our school starts at 8 in the morning. We sometimes help in the house but it isn't compulsory. We aren't allowed to smoke or drink any alcohol.
I went to your annual international art festival. Most of the events I went to were good, but I feel that the festival could be even better next year. So, I am writing to you with some of my opinions and suggestions. I hope it might help with next year's festival.
Looking forward to next year's festival.
One day, a little girl called Sara was walking over a bridge. Suddenly, she heard a man's voice calling her: "Sara...Sara.. look down to the river." Then Sara looked into the river. She was very scared, because she saw a golden fish who was smiling at her and talking to her. After a few seconds, Sara felt that the golden fish was lovely. She had never seen any fish that had that wonderful colour and could talk with her. Because Sara didn't have any brothers and sisters, and her Mom and Dad needed to work every day,  she was very lonely.
Therefore, she came to the river every day and talked about everything with the golden fish. They were very close friends. After half a year, the golden fish suddenly disappeared. Sara was very sad. She sat and cried by the river. Then somebody called her name: "Sara... Sara... look at me... I'm standing on your left-hand side." Sara remembered the  golden fish. It had suddenly become  human, a little boy. After a few days they got married. They had a wonderful life together.
I am writing about the International Arts Festival, which I went to recently. I had a great time there because  is very unusual. I think that the International Arts Festival was absolutely fantastic and successful. I was also pleased with the weekend ticket because I tend to go out at the weekend due to my working on the weekdays  I had time to go and did not have to worry about the ticket price.
First of all, you asked about when I would like to travel. I am afraid that I am available to travel only in July, because I have to work all year except one month's holiday in July.
I am very happy to have won first prize in your competition. I am very interested in spending  two weeks at Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel in July, because it is the summer and the weather is sunny, moreover I am totally free during this month.
Regarding the accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I cannot sleep in a tent.
I like to do sports and I would like to do sailing and surfing for . I am good at those two activities, because I go to the sea every weekend.
Secondly, the plays and movies were marvellous. However, I was disappointed by the number of them. It would be great if there were  more choice  next year. I would like to give you a suggestion about the size of the concert rooms. Considering the crowd, there should be more rooms. Finally, I would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only European artists.
Thank you very much for your letter. I'm very happy to receive some news from you. I'm going to reply to your question.
What about the rules at home? I can't remember, because now I'm 19, so I can do what I want. I know that I had to ask  my Mum or Dad about going out with my friend after  school. They wanted me to do my homework before going out to play. Also, I had to come back  home on time. It was very important for my parents. I didn't want to change anything. I was happy.
"Over The Rainbow" looked very interesting in your advertisement but the organisation and show were almost terrible.
At the end, your theatre restaurant was closed for unknown reasons, but in the advertisement it was clearly stated:
Modern technology makes our lives different, maybe better. Often people do not see how it affects our lifestyle. Useful things like TV sets, radios, computers,  stereos and cars - we are dealing with them every day. They help us with daily life and make it more pleasant. Transport and communication would not exist without cars, trains, planes and telephones. We know our world from TV screens and computer monitors. Without these, and newspapers of course, knowing our world could be hard. On the other hand people are suffering from modern diseases like addiction to television or computers. Finally, we must mention modern medicine. It saves our lives from ancient and modern diseases.
I would like to have some information about the advertisement for the show.
I thank you for reading my letter. I hope you write back to me, and don't forget my money!
I'm surprised to read that I've won the first prize. So I will travel in July because I've only got some free time then. I've got a lot of work and my boss won't allow me to leave my work at any other time.
I am writing this as a reply to your request to provide you with some information about my preferences.
It is great I can do something I really like at the Camp. I really enjoy swimming. We live near the seashore and swimming is the sports activity I am really good at. I am by far the best swimmer in my school. The other subject is photography. I like taking pictures and want to share my interest with  others. I am not a photographer but my family think that my photos are more than just good.
Finally I want to ask you some questions. What will be best to take with me, what will I need at Camp? How much money should I take? Will there be any guided tours? And how many will be at the Camp in July?
People are normally angry after shopping - because it is so easy to get tired. People do not smile at each other, do not talk to each other at the shops. They look like  robots who have to do their duty - to buy.
And if there was musical event, it would be great. I hope the next one will be better. And I would like to thank you for organising this festival.
Let me tell you some rules at school in my country. Actually, we have quite strict rules. When I was a student, I wasn't allowed to wear any fashionable clothes.  And we couldn't wear any colourful clothes and socks. Also our hairstyle was the same for everyone. It's really strict.
The most difficult work was to arrange the coach trip to the concert hall as there were many people from the countryside. It was too complicated. But the rest of the preparation was so good. I've realised pop stars are just like us, down to earth. They were so kind and modest. Do you know what I liked most about this experience? I found pop music so wonderful, it changed my opinion  that classical music is always best. Of course, I've enjoyed being around famous singers, too.
Two sisters, Alex and Daniela, were sitting in front of the fireplace thinking about what they could do. That year, the winter in France was very cold. It was near Christmas and the two girls hadn't found a present for their mother. Giving Christmas presents was a tradition not to be forgotten and there were only four days left. Alex suggested that it would be a good idea to go to the city to buy that present. Daniela agreed but she knew that it was snowing and that it was dangerous to walk in this kind of weather. Anyway, Alex was too stubborn to give up and it was like talking to a brick wall: she didn't listen to her sister.
After forty minutes, the weather became very bad. It was such a pain to walk in the snow. However, Alex was not worried at all despite the fact that her sister was tired and cold. Deep within herself, Alex knew they were lost in the middle of nowhere, but she didn't want to admit it.
Thank you very much for the prize from camp California in America.
Regarding the time that I would like to travel, it must be in July only. This is because my A-level exams are coming up so I really need time to revise, and July is the only month that I am free.
It was an enjoyable time in my life and I wished that you were there with me. Through this letter, I am sure that you will be able to share this experience with me.
For me the most disappointing problem was that the star Danny Brook wasn't there. My husband was also looking forward to seeing Mr. Brook as an actor in your musical because he is one of his greatest fans. The actor who acted instead of Danny Brook wasn't as good as Mr. Brook.
I was impressed with the idea of the festival. I could enjoy different cultures and also I could expand my knowledge. Moreover, the weekend ticket was fantastic because I spent two days at the festival - Saturday and Sunday. The ticket price was not too expensive for a student too.
I'd like to suggest this - concerning plays and films. Plays and films  were good, there weren't enough. In addition, most of the people in the festival liked that. In my opinion, you have to run more plays and films in next year's festival.
Firstly, I did newspaper delivery. I could make a bit of money, of course, it was far more than pocket money. Nevertheless, I lost my concentration on my studies and I spent the money on entertainment. I earned easily and I couldn't control myself at that time. I was only 12 years old.
In addition to this, some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there for the occasion and, personally speaking, I think the show could be done in the open air next year, so that the music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.
Furthermore the weekend ticket was reasonably-priced and this was an excellent decision because it gave the opportunity to a lot of people, adults but also students, to take part in the Festival.
I would also like to know how much money I will get from you for these two weeks because I would like to spend some money on clothes.
It was  hard but also  fun work. You should try to get some experience at such a concert.  You would not regret it.
I am a nineteen-year-old girl who is still attending classes at Saint John's School. For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses in painting.
I would appreciate it if I could travel in July because my school gives me two weeks' summer holiday. As far as accommodation is concerned, I prefer staying in a log cabin. I believe it is better than a tent because that would not provide enough shelter. As I said before, I have been playing tennis for four years. I consider myself to be good at this sport. As regards painting, I know a lot about it since my grandmother taught me when I was five years old.
Do you remember when I told you that my dream was to help Mano's group? Well, my dream came true. It all started when I was at Drama Club and my singing teacher told me that Mano's group were going to have a concert here, in Argentina. She also told me that she has some connections with the people in charge of the lights at the concert. You know that last year I organised the lights at our performance. So, there I was, controlling the illumination of Mano's concert!!!!
I will never forget that wonderful experience. It has really helped me for our next performance at the Drama Club. It was so exciting to see  Mano's  singer that I felt as if I were in heaven!!
When it comes to activities, I would like to try climbing and surfing. I started surfing when I was 12. So I am quite confident at this. Although I had a few experiences of climbing, my everyday training at gym . In addition to these reasons, both activities are popular, especially in California.
However, things which you can get with money do not necessarily  your dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be greater.
I'm writing to you because I have been asked to make a little suggestion about the programme you have organised for our English class trip.
On the other hand, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show and we would all like to go the show. We think it is a good opportunity because London fashion is the most important in the world, and we all will learn a lot about London style going to this show.
We think we could  the shopping   to go to the show. The show is free, and it is only on Tuesday 14th of March. It is open from 10.00 until 19.00, and we could go there in the afternoon.
All the group would enjoy going to the show, because it is a great opportunity to see an exhibition of the latest fashions. We know that you have planned a very complete programme but we would like to suggest you move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon so that we can go to the show, which lasts from 10am to 7pm, on Tuesday.
Politicians, musicians or film stars are watched all the time, from when they wake up in the morning until they go to bed in the evening, by journalists and photographers who follow them and observe all that they do.
I am writing to give suggestions regarding the international art festival, which I went to one week ago. It was really good, but I feel it could be better next year.
Firstly, I want to say it is a great idea to have this international arts festival. It is very interesting, especially for  young people. I went to this festival with four friends and all of us enjoyed our time there very much. It was said that stars and artists from around the world would be there in the advertisement, but in fact they were from only six different countries, so I hope there will be artists from more  countries next year. Although the jazz, rock and classical music was great, some  and halls were too small. Could you consider making them bigger next year?
Anyway, in my country, generally, children are free at home, but it also depends on their parents. For me, I don't have rules at home - I just don't make trouble for my family. That's all.
When the holidays begin everybody is happy because it represents the beginning of a time full of fun and lots of interesting things to do, but in order to do these things we all need money and that is a big problem for most of us.
'As I have a choice I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions. As I was requested I should choose two activities from the list. So I decided to choose climbing and photography. These two are easy to connect, I could climb and make pictures at the same time. I am very keen on photography. Last year I took part in a photographer's contest and I won a second prize in Poland in the category of ,,beautiful scenery''. Climbing, in contrast, is something I started a few months ago, so I have not gained any success in this sport. But you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it. I would like to ask about clothes. Do I need any formal ones? I would also like to know what the cost of spending two weeks in the U.S.A. is.
Thank you very much for your letter. I am very happy about having won the competition. I have several things to tell you and some questions about the camp.
First, I would like to travel in July because it is the only free month I have in the summer. I have exams in June and a job in August. Then, about accommodation, I would prefer a tent because I am used to it. I have already been to other summer camps and I always choose this accommodation. I find it more sociable than a log cabin.
I have chosen from the activities offered to do photography. I have already been a member of a photography club so I am experienced. I also would like to do climbing but I have never done it before.
I made sandwiches for all the staff for a major part of the afternoon and then I sold tickets to the audience all  evening. I was very tired but when the concert began I felt excited because there were so many people dancing and singing in front of the stage.
First of all, Danny Brook, an excellent actor, who (according to the play advertisement) was supposed to perform, was replaced by a disappointing actor. Besides that the spectacle was meant to start at 19:30, but ended up starting at 20:15. In addition to all this, the promised discounts on the tickets were not offered. Finally, after the play the theatre restaurant was still closed. Sir, I couldn't believe  it, everything that was in the advertisement was a lie.
Some people glorify technology as if it was the best thing that has ever happened in their lives. However, since I was a child I have noticed that, except for the medical facilities and achievements, it has brought  me more disadvantages than advantages. I still remember the day the television came to my house. I was only seven, everybody was excited about the new "toy", however, what seemed to be only one more way to get together, turned out to rule our lives. Unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was  among us. Before TV, we used to spend our nights playing cards, telling jokes, talking to each other. Nowadays, I barely know my parents, but I do know exactly what is happening in the soap operas. On the other hand, due to scientific developments, I am getting better, recovering from asthma. In addition to this it is wonderful not to have to wait too long to eat, thanks to the invention of microwaves. Despite all these advantages, I deeply miss the times I had almost no technological devices, but a very happy and united family.
As far as I can remember, I had to respect a lot of rules but the most important ones were concerning wearing  suitable clothes, arriving on time and getting on with every teacher and authority figure. As a consequence, most schoolmates used to complain about those rules but all of us tried to put up with them.
I had a very disappointing evening last Saturday. I had everything planned; my family and I were coming to watch your show and then have a decent meal at your theatre restaurant but it was disastrous. Firstly there was no discount available, though you promised one in your advertisement, so even my 6-year-old son was charged the adult price. Then everything was going well until the show didn't start! Supposedly it was to start at 19:30. Well it didn't. It started 45 minutes late, at exactly 20:15. And by the way may I ask you how up-to-date your leaflets are because in spite of the advert saying the starring actor was Danny Brook,  it wasn't. It was another actor and one I had never heard of. That was a disappointment for my whole family. In fact all the audience were very disappointed.
Our homes will still be the same in terms of the cuisine. It will still be filled with vegetables and meat. This is because people won't give up the great taste of food. Although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
Are you fed up with looking after the screaming baby of your mother's friend? You could move from children to pets and become a dog-sitter, spending your afternoons walking round the park and chatting with a friend.
I am writing in response to the International Arts Festival, which took place on 21-22 November. I would like to inform you that it was a great idea and a  activity as a social event.
It wasn't difficult to find the right hall for the shows, I would say it was very well organised.
Finally, I appreciate your  and look forward to hearing about the next International Arts Festival.
On the other hand, in the state schools as I said, we are more respectful to the teacher and bad behaviour is punished. For example, you have to do more homework or they send you home etc. Of course smoking isn't allowed in any part of the school.
The activities that I'd like to do: the first one  would be basketball and to be honest I can play it very well because I used to be a basketball player in my high school; the second activity  would be tennis. I am not an expert at this  because I've played it only twice but I know how to hit the ball and basic stuff like that; serving the ball, backhand and forehand to hit the ball.
Finally I have something to ask you about how many people can stay in one tent. Do I have to bring swimming trunks if I want to swim at the camp? How much money do I need and what else do I need to pay for?
I'm  happy to hear that I have won the first prize. Here is the information you want from me.  Firstly, I can only go in July, because I'm on  holiday at that time. I think I would prefer , because it is more safe, and I wouldn't like to be in the log cabins.
I am just writing this letter in order to complain about the musical show I saw last Sunday, in the evening.
I came to notice the difference at  work, since  all tasks were performed on the computer and I needed to learn how to use that machine.
At that time, I decided to buy my own computer and every day I was improving my knowledge. First I came to write letters and articles, next I learned several computer games. From when I learned how to use the Internet, I haven't stopped until now.
Even if my parents don't  like going out at night or studying you shouldn't think that living in my house is like living in heaven because I can't play the guitar or listen to music at a loud volume or invite my friends over for a Saturday night party.
I am writing to you first of all to thank you for the excellent programme that you have given us for the trip to London, especially for planning a visit to the science museum, which we believe is going to be very interesting.
In addition to this, it is going to be a great opportunity for all of us, because for  students it is completely free.
You know I love reading books, it's my passion. I've read all the books of the English author Ernest Hemingway. They are great I tell you! But I think your cousin is too young for them. Why? Because he  concentrates on the history, society and political situation of the time the story is set. That can be quite difficult to understand, especially for young people. For me, his books are great. But anyway, do you know the book with the title 'The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie'? It's written by Agatha Christie. She's an American and her books concentrate on crime and detective stories. Her books aren't difficult to understand. She writes books especially for young people. And I think this book is a very good one for your cousin. You wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? I think this is the best choice for him!
There will also be "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" on the 14th of March, which consists of an exhibition of the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. It will be free for us as we are students.
I understand that you're looking for a birthday present for your cousin, and you'd like to give  her a book, which, I think, is a good idea. The last book I read was Wuthering Heights by Emilie BrontÃ«. It's a fantastic book, which I recommend to everybody keen on love stories. It's a perfect combination of passion and life's difficulties. I reckon that it's  not an easy read, but as you described your cousin, I think she really will enjoy it, she's so good at literature that it won't be a problem for her. I really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personality. It'll be a good point for her general education. Wuthering Heights is a classic, which everybody knows about , even if they haven't read it, they at least know the story.
A computer is extremely helpful with writing reports and essays. And, of course, I cannot forget about cars and planes that take us to all parts of the Earth.
Counting the pros and cons, I tend to think that there are more positive points to  and manufacturing new technologies than negative ones anyway. A modern girl or boy is already unable to imagine life without them.
I would like to give you some details about the show that I saw in an advertisement yesterday. It is at the Central Exhibition Hall in London. It starts at 10.00 am and finishes at 19.00 pm. The date of the show is  Tuesday the 14th of March. It will be a really great opportunity to go to the show when we are in London. We would like to go there because it is very popular nowadays. I've heard that the Leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles are really wonderful. It is also free for students. We all know that you have organised everything. However, we can change the programme. Here are some suggestions that I would like to let you have. We have some free time on Wednesday the 15th of March in the afternoon so we can go to the Science Museum on Wednesday. We can also do our shopping quickly after sightseeing in London.
A DAY IN MY LIFE
I am writing about our class trip to London. First of all, I appreciate your well-organised programme, especially the "River Trip to Greenwich" which we requested. It will be the most exciting activity on this trip.
However, I saw the advertisement for "THE LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW" in the newspaper today, and told all our classmates about it. We are very interested in going to this show. So I would like to suggest you change  part of the programme so we can visit this show.
Unfortunately, our programme is fixed but I think we could change  part of the programme. For example, "shopping on 14 March' can be changed to 15 March instead of "Free time". So we will be able to use the time in the afternoon on 14 March for visiting the show.
I have received the good news and I'm very happy because I have always wanted to go to California and now it's really happening, so, thank you very much for that.
First of all, I would like to give you some further information about me and secondly, I'd like to ask you about some concerns that I have.
I know that my girlfriend told you that I was helping at a pop concert and enjoyed it very much. , she told me that you are very keen to know about my experience, so I'll give you some information in this letter that I'm sure you will be glad to have, even though you have not been to the concert.
First of all, I'll tell you that on the day of the concert I woke up at 6:30 a.m., very early for me. You know me, I'm lazy. The work began around 8:30. It was very hard but then the band came  to rehearse. From that moment I enjoyed working until the concert had finished. The atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team. During the concert I listened to the band like everybody else, besides I earned money, so it was a wonderful experience.
On behalf of our class I would like to give you some information about the London Fashion and Leisure show that we saw advertised and we are interested in . In addition we would like to thank you for the programme.
I would like to mention that on this day we are going to visit the Science Museum in the morning and after we are going  shopping, so I believe it will be a good chance for all of us to attend this show as it is free for students! The most important thing is that the time that the show starts is perfect and is compatible as well with our programme because by 19:00 I think that everyone will have finished their shopping.
Secondly, I would like to give you more details about the show and particularly about what  it includes. The latest fashions will be on show and also the Leisure and sports wear. Really interesting! Moreover . I think that this show will be a great opportunity for all of us while we are  in London. But if there is a problem because the show is on Tuesday afternoon, the same time as our shopping trip, I suggest going  shopping on Wednesday afternoon when we will not have anything to do!
I believe that if somebody wants  fame and  glory he must be totally clear about the results. For example,  politicians  have chosen their careers; they must know that  and the most important thing is that they have to realize that they should be extremely careful about their movements or else they are going to have a bad reputation, and they will not be considered trustworthy.
Secondly, I wonder if you know that the "London fashion and Leisure Show" will be held on Tuesday at the Central Exhibition Hall. In other words, what they will  is very interesting to us.  with your plan. What a pity!
All of us want to go to the show. The generation who are the same age as us all like make-up, , and it's important that it will be free for students and just be  for one day. So, we don't want to miss this chance.
The Annual International Arts Festival, which was held on the 21st and 22nd of November, was colourful with  stars and artists coming from around the world. Although this was true, they were from only six countries. You could have let us get acquainted with more cultures by inviting guests from some other countries too.
It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me, but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year. Then it would be excellent.
I am writing to complain about a  show that I saw at your theatre.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Her school classmates were going to throw their friend Maria a party and it was going to be a surprise for her. They organized everything. The event was going to take place in the garden at Paula's house. Some of them were in charge of bringing music. The others had to bring food. That  afternoon they arrived at Paula's house  to decorate the place. Balloons and coloured lights were put in all the trees. A table was laid with a lot of delicious food and a beautiful cake was in the centre of it. Some time later everything was finally prepared. The garden was wonderful. The children were very enthusiastic because they thought that Maria was going to be very happy with this surprise. But things didn't happen as they had planned. Because when Maria reached the house, they realised that she had been told about the party and they supposed that Pat had done this.
Ordinary lessons attended by students of different levels of ability.
Firstly, I'm writing to thank you for the great opportunity you are giving us, especially in planning all this programme in such  accurate way. I think that this programme is  well-organised, as you know, because we have enough time to visit plenty of local interest points. But I was wondering, as a student of this college, if we could change part of this programme ... we'd like to go to the London Fashion and Leisure Show. It takes place on Tuesday 14th and begins at ten o'clock. In this way, we can go to visit the Science Museum earlier in the morning and then we can go to the show.
Do you think you've got the future in your hands? Do you think we're living like in olden times? Would you like to live in a modern way? What do you expect in the future? Can you compare it ...? Are you afraid?
Well, you can look at your house ... Nowadays, we have all kinds of instruments for washing up the dishes, for cooking to be more convenient, for example, the TV, the video recorder, etc.
Maybe, in a few years' time we'll have a bigger TV, a more suitable radio but, in my opinion, I think these facts will not change our way of  life. We will be able to speed up the running of  computer games, for example... But not in any strange way you can imagine...I mean I don't think we'll change cars into aeroplanes...
All of us would like to attend the show because young people, particularly girls, are interested in fashion and make-up, so we are expecting the show to be a great opportunity to see what the new trends in fashion will be like. It would be great if you made a little change in the programme so that we are able to attend the show.  It seems to be good to change the programme of 14th to the London Fashion and Leisure show, instead of the science museum and shopping.  I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Technical and Warm Home People's way of life has been changed considerably by rapidly developing modern technology.  To begin with, it will be good to look back on how our parents have lived in a house. 50 years ago, Korean mothers should have made a fire by burning wood to warm a room up and make food.  Since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lives have been far easier than before. Today, however, people do not need to spend much time on making food, washing up, or even on turning the light on and off.  Machines, such as the dishwasher, washing machine and remote control help us just to relax or do a little necessary work. In my opinion, people's homes in the future will be controlled by a computer which is built into every machine, TV, cooker and the light, connected to the owner.  He/she can just press the button or send e-mail to operate what he/she needs, even though the owner is far from the house. On the other hand, people will still be living in a building which is constructed for a "family".  In spite of the computer, children will need food their mothers make and love expressed not by a computer, but by parents themselves. A computer might know more than a human, but there are many things which it cannot replace in our life.
I would like to go to "Camp California" in July because I will have to produce "Mission Impossible III" from August. I will be busy deciding everything about this film and will not have enough time to go there.
By the way, do you want to hear about my experience of the pop concert? OK! Here we go!
Hoping for your agreement and looking forward to hearing from you.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. I was having a holiday with my parents and some friends in India and we were enjoying talking to people and eating the local food. One day we were invited by some locals to visit a little town five hours away from New Dehli. Although my parents were very happy about having such a special opportunity of visiting a place with no tourists, I was a little bit scared.
We spent 2 weeks with the family. The first week was fine, but in the second week I got very sick. I think it was the water. My mother tried to get a doctor, but they said there was no one.
You want to hear about my experience of helping at a pop concert. You can't imagine how fun it was! You could do so many things because you received a free pass which allowed you to go where you wanted and that was what I liked about this experience.
Lastly, it could be nice for students who are interested in the arts, if you offer special events, for instance, a song contest, writing competition or dance lessons.
Do you need money? If you do,  why you want to earn money. That is very important to find a way of earning and saving money.
If you just decide to work, you'd better find a job near your place. Firstly, go to your school or local council. They will be able to help to find safe and suitable jobs for students like you. Secondly, ask your family or friends. As they know about your interests and personality, it is easy to help you. In my case, 
I had such a desire to go to the disco that I decided to go even without my parents' permission. I told my secret to my best friend, Pat. But she told it to every kid in school, even the teachers heard it. It happened that one of the teachers told my parents about it. In the end I was punished and stayed at home for two weeks.
Well, about rules in my country, the situation is not different from other countries. The rules must be respected by all people if you don't want to be kicked out of school. You must be organised, clean and respect the rights of other people.
First of all, the actor was different from the one mentioned in your advertisement. I mean he was not Danny Brook. Secondly,  about forty-five minutes, because it started at 20:15. . Due to being a student, I think I should have got the discount on your ticket price with my ID card. Besides this, the theatre restaurant closed early. As soon as the show ended, I went  there  to have a dessert.
While she was choosing vegetables at a market, she came across him. When he asked her, 'Why do you choose carefully?', she answered without thinking. That caused the secret to be disclosed.
As you told me in your last letter, you were talking about rules in your class and you wanted to know about school rules in my country and also what I am allowed to do at home. First, I must tell you that the teachers are strict at school. We aren't allowed to eat in the classrooms and in addition to this we must sit down at individual desks. We can't chat with our classmates. How boring! At home everything is quite good, because mum and dad are great but there's one main rule: I must tell them where I am going and what time I'll come back. Granny is the problem because she's a bit bossy! She usually tells me what to do and what kinds of clothes I should wear but I don't take any notice of her.
However, some of them have read an advertisement about the London Fashion and Leisure Show, which will take place at the Central Exhibition Hall in London on 14th March. The Exhibition will show all the latest fashions over a very wide range from sportswear to make-up and even hairstyles. What is more, the show is free for all  students. We feel that taking part in it would be a great opportunity for us since we will be able to get some information about the world of fashion, which is becoming more and more important in our time.
, I was asked by the class to inform you about the show and to ask if it would be possible to make some changes to the programme if it  the exhibition. It will take place on Tuesday from 10.00am to 7.00pm, so we could give up  shopping and go to the show in the afternoon.
Being rich and famous is something all of us have dreamt of at some time. But famous people aren't always happy with their situation. Usually if you ask them what they  desire most, the answer is: "I would like to be able to live like ordinary people do."
In conclusion, I believe that it is certainly right that famous people accept their situation, with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings. On the other hand, however, I think that they deserve to have a private life like all other people have. Also the most famous star can be unhappy and depressed: in fact, money and celebrity don't always bring happiness.
First of all, I am a student and would like to travel in July. This is because I intend to take an examination in September. So I can afford to go on holiday only in July. Secondly, I would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents. It will be my first time experiencing staying there and I am interested in trying new things which I have not tried.
The next consideration is the activities. Actually, I used to play basketball for 6 years and am quite confident at it. And recently, I have been practising tennis as a school activity. Therefore I would like to choose basketball and tennis.
Hello! I hope everything around you is alright. You might not believe it but actually I helped at a pop concert last month and I really enjoyed it so much. So I'm now writing to let you know how great it was. All the work I needed to do wasn't very interesting.  I must have set thousands of chairs correctly and after finishing I put them back nicely. The reason I enjoyed it very much is that I could meet the vocalist during setting chairs just before they started practising. I was asked if I wanted to sit down in front of the stage. Naturally I agreed and I could enjoy their gig as a member of the audience. It was absolutely fantastic. I had ever never sat down there. Additionally, you won't believe it, but the vocalist said "All the chairs you are sitting  on were set out by him," pointing at me!! Actually I was a bit ashamed but it will be my brilliant memory.
Taking the programme and the show into consideration, we suggest that we would have time to go to the show in the afternoon on Tuesday. We suppose that during our free time on Wednesday we can find some time for shopping. We hope that you consider our suggestion.
I played Basketball at school for about two years. I am rather good at it. I also had Painting as my main subject at school for five years. I like painting very much, and I think I am good at Painting. I paint a lot in my free time. I prefer painting landscapes and fantasy pictures.
It would be also very interesting to film the situation during the break. The smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at their tables doing their homework.
Recently, we had a very interesting discussion about how science and technology affects our lives. My life has also changed as a result of modern technology. Thanks to computers, phones, mobile phones, and the Internet I can communicate with other people faster than I was able to  before. My father is a sailor and I see him only four times a year. But thanks to mobile phones I can contact him even if he is sailing in the Atlantic Ocean. I also enjoy shopping on the Internet. This way I don't have to  be queuing in shops and supermarkets and I can choose fashionable clothes. In the future I would love to be a doctor, especially a cardiologist. Nowadays, modern technology is used in medicine more often and it can minimise the risk of the death of the patients.
First of all I would like to thank you. Now I am going to give you some further information: I would like to travel only in July because I am a student in high school and this is the most important year of my life. I am studying for the university entrance exams and I have to study until the end of June and then at the end of June I will have the university entrance exam and after that, in July, I am going to be alright.
I would prefer a tent because I have never stayed in a tent before and I am wondering what it is going to be like. And from these activities I will choose basketball and swimming: basketball because I am very good at it, swimming because I like to swim very much but I'm not a very good swimmer. And finally I would like to ask you some questions. My first question is about clothes; what kind of clothes do we need to take with us? And how much money do we need to take?
If I were to talk about my own life, my speech would be simple: "My electronic alarm clock wakes me up in the morning. I go to school by underground. When I come home, I cook my meal in the microwave. In my spare time, I watch television, play with my computer, or chat on the Internet..." There is no sentence without electronic devices. I wonder what I could do without them... I don't go out with my friends or read books. I have friends on the Internet and can learn anything while surfing  it. I sometimes get bored or feel isolated, because I know I am living in a virtual world.
I'm writing to you in reply to your letter. I was really surprised when I opened it. I look forward to going to the Camp California in the USA. I would like to travel only in July because my family is going to visit me in August and I will have to look after them. I prefer staying in tents to staying in log cabins, because it reminds me of my childhood. I used to go with my friends to a camp, which was situated by the seaside.
I used to like shopping, but recently I came across many disadvantages of this activity. Most people think that if they have got money they will buy everything  they want. It isn't true. Nowadays we have many big shopping centres. We like them because everything is in one place. The most suitable time for shopping is the weekend when parents don't work and children haven't got  school. Because of that, shopping centres are overcrowded. You can't buy something in a peaceful and calm atmosphere. In addition, in this kind of shops prices are very high, of course not all of them. However such centres are very useful and necessary. In my opinion the worst thing which may happen is an extremely long queue for the changing room. It is really exhausting. Afterwards you are all in. Nevertheless sometimes shopping can be enjoyable. If you bought something gorgeous, you will be very happy. On balance I think that shopping should be a nice thing so if you are in a bad mood don't go shopping.
First of all, I want to thank you on behalf of the class for your excellent  and programme, and especially for the fact that you are giving us some free time. We really appreciate this.
However, we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show. The show is on Tuesday the 14th of March, from 10 to 7 o'clock in the Central Exhibition Hall. The latest fashions in leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles will be shown there.
This is a great opportunity for us, because we haven't ever before been to this kind of show. As well as this,  entrance for students is free.
In our society some people are treated like animals in the zoo by the press, just because they are famous and well known to a high number of other people. The newspapers print everything about them. The  is searching for every little bit of information they can get. The photographers are chasing these people just to take a picture of them to show how they eat or with whom they meet. The photos will be in tomorrow's press and so rumours are born.
After I waited for about 45 minutes the show suddenly started but I  realised that the main actor Danny Brook, who was the reason why I went to the show, had been replaced by another actor, who couldn't sing  half as well as Brook.
After one hour the whole class had heard about Sarah's secret. Everybody was interested in what she had won but nobody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them. Sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around  talking and whispering started. Suddenly, she went to Pat and asked him, "Did you tell anybody about our secret?" Pat told her everything. Sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except Pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
I was really pleased to receive your letter yesterday. You asked me about rules, both in my home and at my school. I am very happy to tell you about this.
Timson's wife, who was good-looking and young, couldn't know about this, but one beautiful day she asked him how his son was and where he was at that moment. Timson was really shocked! He couldn't even say a word. He tried to think who could have told his wife . Of course, only one person knew this apart from his best friends. This was his secretary Pat, however, he couldn't be sure and decided to check  up.
The next day, he understood that he was right. Timson had a row at home and also needed a new secretary. It was the worst weekend of the last few years. On the other hand, now everything is OK. Timson has a good close family, his son lives with them, his company is making a good profit... Only Pat has problems, she !
Because of this situation I will be very busy in the first week of July, and I would appreciate it if you could give me the option to begin my "Camp California" experience on July 10th. About the accommodation I would prefer to sleep in a tent, because I have never been in one, and it is a lot more fun than log cabins.
When I was a child I never liked to go shopping because my Mum spent so much time in the shops that I remember that going shopping with her was a nightmare. It is amazing how people change over the yearsFor example now shopping for me is one of the most entertaining things, and every week I have to buy something. I enjoy fashion so much that my life has changed completely since I started to study fashion design and I discovered that fabrics, and colors, are really enjoyable. But these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer  and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. I find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes. Anyway, shopping is always  satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
In your last letter you asked me about the concert... oh it was fantastic! I've always loved music so working at a concert was great.
I write to you because last Friday I had a very disappointing evening at your theatre. I went there because I had read a  about the musical show "Over the rainbow", but a lot of information was wrong.
But when we arrived at 2.00 pm to see the 2.30 pm show, we couldn't enter  the theatre because the discounts weren't available. So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes for the beginning of the show! Not only that: we had the bad surprise that Brook had been replaced by another actor!
The inventions of the aeroplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day. It means that daily life is faster and busier because I'm able to go to school in the morning and then to play soccer in the afternoon, and in a few minutes I can be on the other side of Lecce to play piano with my  band, then I can go back home when I want, listening to the news about what has happened around the world on my car radio. So I have many more interesting things to do in my life.
But the most important innovation in technological development is the computer. At every time of the day I can communicate with people of all nationalities of the world, I can get information about everything, I can buy something which I can't find in the shops in my town, so I can do anything just by clicking on the mouse!
Furthermore, there was no Danny Brook on the stage. He is my favourite artist and I went there mainly because of him. This made me really disappointed - he wasn't performing there.
In the advertisement, it  said that Danny Brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing. I could not see any portion of Danny Brook's performance in him.
On the other hand, because of being on computers so much, I cannot see my family and friends very much, even when we are in the same place. It is really bad to make your human relations get weaker. But despite this, I am very happy with the technological facilities in my daily life.
Recently I visited an arts festival organized with your help. I enjoyed it very much and I think the idea of  it is great. However, I have some proposals for its improvement next year.
And, finally, I should congratulate you on the decision  to have one weekend ticket for all events. I support this idea which is convenient both for the public and the organisers.
I am looking forward to the festival next year.
Thanks for your letter and postcard. It was really nice . The things you wrote about in your letter are quite familiar for me, because we, at the moment, have some problems with our rules.
I'm really fed up with our school uniform! It is awful! And the problem is that nobody wants to wear it. That's why our headmaster is really angry. Of course, if we had a pretty uniform like yours, we would wear it with pleasure. But it's impossible at the moment.
What is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment. It can really help a lot to cure people. Maybe there will be a cure for AIDs or cancer soon.
Firstly, I would like to travel in July because I have some holidays during that month. I am working the rest of this summer.
You also asked me about two activities. I choose singing because I love singing and I have been in a choir for 7 years now. I also choose climbing. Unfortunately I am not so good at it. But I would take the opportunity to improve .
First of all, the tickets were too expensive. I was told that there were some discounts for students, but  the moment I bought the ticket, they charged me  full price.
I am really astonished that I won this competition! It is great and I want to say thank you for the two weeks at Camp California . I have never been to California before.
I am pleased to choose two activities, because now I will be able to learn SINGING and SURFING! I am not good at either activity, but it will be a pleasure to try them, especially surfing. I would like to feel the wind in my hair, and enjoy how quickly the board goes over the sea.
On the other hand it is not as important, the main reason is I really look forward to going to this camp and, one more time, thanks a lot!
I can travel in July only because I am working in an office and I must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the month he can give me one, so I hope that isn't a problem for you.
I am very sorry to say it was definitely not a perfect evening out, and I am therefore asking you for a refund for the amount I paid, or part of it. You will find the receipt enclosed.
I don't write letters to my friends anymore, and wait weeks before receiving answers, I just send an electronic mail via the Internet and the person receives it within seconds.
I am really mad and I want my money back. Please call me on the number 23456789, I will be waiting for your call. Thank you for your time
I have been to London recently for a week's holiday and I have been to a musical show at the Circle Theatre. When I saw the advertisement for the show I got very excited, because I always wanted to see "Over the Rainbow", but I had some problems, and I want you to know about them.
First of all, when I bought the tickets I got no discount, and in the advertisement it was stated that people would get some, and when I got into the theatre to see the play, I had to wait for almost an hour until the show begun. Then, I got very disappointed because the actors in the play were not those ones mentioned in the advertisement. There were unknown actors, and they were not as good as the other ones. Afterwards, I was expecting to have at least a nice dinner in the theatre restaurant, but it was already closed because the show ended too late.
First of all, I would like to travel in July because this is the beginning of my holidays, and I would not like to miss some of my school classes. Besides, I would prefer to stay in a tent, because I got used to being in tents since I spend my holidays every summer with my friends in the hills.
AFTER THE SHOW, I WENT TO VISIT YOUR RESTAURANT AS SUGGESTED IN THE ADVERTISEMENT BUT WHEN I GOT THERE IT WAS CLOSED. ONE OF THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THEATRE TOLD ME THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLEANING IT TO GET RID OF THE RATS. I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WHEN HE TOLD ME THIS.
SINCE I WAS BORN, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING FASTER AND FASTER. JUST FOR EXAMPLE, THE INTERNET GETS HUNDREDS OF NEW USERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES IN MANY WAYS AND WE ALMOST DON'T NOTICE IT.
But when I stand outside every shop, I can't resist my desire. If I have got enough money to buy something that I want to buy, I can buy them and it will be no problem. However, If I haven't got enough money, I will not be able to buy what I want and it will be a very big problem. I feel depressed. Shopping is not enjoyable any more. I'll think about why I'm so poor. But I can get over it. I go window shopping. Instead of buying something, I buy some fresh food and Ice-cream. They make me happy and rich. I can try all the shoes, clothes, hats, accessories and jackets on. They are mine!
When I was at the university I was very keen on basketball and I played for the university team. In 1998 we were the champion of the First National League. Also I am quite a good swimmer. I think that is because of my long legs. So I would love to take part in basketball and swimming activities while I am at the camp.
Modern technology has created other conveniences: I can pay my bills at any time and do not need to wait in a big queue to be attended by the teller, I can exchange photos and videos via computer, I can do business and make money at home, and so on.
I love swimming, but I am not any good at swimming. I really want to learn how to swim. I was wondering if there is a coach who could give me a lesson at the Camp. Also, I would like to join the basketball team. I used to play basketball when I was in high school, and our high school basketball team has won many competitions during the last ten years in our city. I am glad I have taken  part in a few competitions, and I was so proud of our basketball team.
It was great to hear from you, haven't seen you since last summer holiday, hope everything is fine at your place.
First, I was wondering if I could travel in July. I am working at a language school. Due to a shortage of teachers in summer I can take holiday only in July. Second, I would like to sleep in a tent because I have never slept in a tent and I have wanted to sleep there. Third, I have chosen 'Tennis' and 'Photography' as my activities at the Camp. I have been playing tennis for over ten years. In addition, I have been teaching children to play tennis for three years. I took up taking photos four years ago. Since then I have entered ten competitions and won the first prize three times.
First, I helped to prepare the stage before the band arrived. The musical instruments were transported from the lorries (three big lorries!) into the concert hall and I helped to put them in the right position on the stage. They were very heavy and I had to carry them with care because they were very important to the band. After that I helped to test lights and microphones. I almost fainted when the band arrived and entered the stage. I am a fan of this band and I have never seen them in the flesh.
So when Caroline, his girlfriend, told him something personal and very important, because she trusted in him, immediately he went to see one of his friends to tell him the secret. When poor Caroline arrived at school on Wednesday morning all the students in her class knew about what she had said just the day before to Pat.
So immediately she went to Pat, angry, in order to argue with him, saying that she was annoyed by the way he behaved, and that it wasn't the first time that he wasn't capable of keeping a secret. After a long conversation they eventually decided to split up.
All of us want to go on this trip, but some of my classmates saw an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show, and we would all like to go there. It is from 10 am to 7 p.m. It  the latest fashion, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles. All of us are really interested, and it is free for students to get in as well. It is a really good opportunity to go because most of us are studying fashion design, and we can learn loads of things  there. So would you please reschedule the visit to the Science Museum for Wednesday afternoon, and we can cancel our shopping and free time, so we can go to the fashion show on Tuesday.
It was two years ago. My classmates and I went on a leadership trip to London. This trip was organised by our form tutor. He wanted to test  if we trusted each other and worked in a team, and the trip lasted for 3 days. The first days were  fine. We just had to do some teamwork things.
On the second day, we had to climb up a twenty-metre hill with our hands. It was so difficult for me because I had been really scared to stand on a high place since I was young. I did not want to climb up but I did not have any choice. So I started to climb really slow and carefully, and I climbed about 15 metres quite successfully, so I tried to climb quicker because the destination was not far away. But after I climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped . I  nearly fell , but luckily my hand caught a rock. It was dangerous, but I didn't have any choice. Finally I did it.
I went to the theatre to buy the ticket and expected to get a discount as I was a student. However, the salesman in the box office told me the discount tickets had sold out. I could not understand why but I still bought the ticket because I was crazy about Danny Brook. Then, I went into the theatre on time but became a little bit angry after waiting until 20:15, forty-five minutes after the expected starting time. Furthermore, I was so disappointed to find out that Danny Brook was not on the stage and the leading actor sang so badly that I left the theatre before it finished. Last, I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because it needed cleaning.
A week later, when I was still in a bad mood, my form teacher, Mrs Brown, talked about jobs in our English lesson. She told us there were numerous types of job in the world. Some offered a high salary while some did not. However, they are equally important for our society. 'Who wants to be a doctor?' She asked. Many students raised their hands. 'Who wants to be a lawyer?' Again, many students put up their hand. But when she asked who wanted to be a cleaner, nobody raised his hand and I felt so ashamed that I lowered my head. 'Cleaner is a very good job.' Mrs Brown said in a loud voice. 'If there were no cleaners, who would clean the school for us? Who would keep the environment nice and tidy?' Suddenly, all my classmates applauded and smiled at me with respect. The teacher also grinned and I was so impressed and repeated the words in my heart: 'All  jobs have the same importance.'
Being on  holiday  in London, I dreamed of going to the theatre to a musical show. I saw your advertisement last Monday, and thought, "It is that one that I want to try."
There were no discount seats because it was not planned by the theatre like that. What was written in the advertisement?
I was terribly annoyed! I spent the worst evening of my holiday at this show!
So I now need a "perfect - refund -" in replacement for your "perfect evening out".
"How has modern technology changed your daily life?" First of all, "daily life" concerns (as far as I am concerned) my life everywhere, and more precisely at home, at the university and at work. As recently as two years ago, I was working with a notebook or diary, and I used to use  a wired phone system. Nowadays, I organise my activities with an electronic organizer that allows me to connect to the Internet by infra-red link with my mobile phone to get information and electronic mail. I am always available on my mobile phone, which is also boring sometimes! Being on an apprenticeship, I go to both work and university. At the university, I have studied with computer-aided systems. I often go on the Internet to find information when studying a particular subject more closely (university technology sites). At work my particular job involves two standard PCs with specific software plus one workstation with the Stanford University Network (SUN) operating system and a special computer that my firm is now developing. At home, I have got a personal computer for my mail and accounts, and electronic mail plus the Internet for keeping in touch with my friends who are on the other side of France or Germany, Korea and so on. So modern technology has totally changed my daily life!
Firstly, the most suitable month would be  July because I am very busy with my work now, and my children are on holiday then.
The activities are really interesting and I would take part in Painting and Climbing. I am not very good at painting, but I choose it because it is a good opportunity to do it. Personally, Climbing is an interesting activity, where you need concentration and you are working with your whole body. I don't want to disappoint you, but I am beginner! I choose these activities because I love challenges.
Heathcliff used to play with Catherine. They were good friends but Heanly, Catherine's brother, hated Heathcliff. Heanley couldn't accept the good relationship and love between Catherine and Heathcliff and, for that reason, he sent Heathcliff to work on the farm. In the meantime Catherine met Edgar Linton and in the end she married Edgar because of he money and good education.
Thank you very much for your kind letter. I was very surprised at the result of the competition. Now I am happy to give you all the information you need.
I think it would be better for me to travel in July. I will start an Italian course in August, so it will be impossible for me to leave then.
In your letter you ask me to choose between tents or log cabins.  Well I prefer to stay in a log cabin. It is more comfortable and I am afraid of wild animals. I saw you offer a lot of activities.  That's fantastic! It is very difficult to decide which two of these activities I like most and I can also do  best. I think I will choose singing because I have sung for five years in a church choir and I do it very well. The other activity I like very much is swimming. I have taken part in a lot of competitions.
Now I hope you will answer soon and tell me a bit about your adventure .
We would like to ask if we could go to this show on the 15th March instead of doing the visit to the Science Museum. We could do that on the Wednesday, 15th March, in the afternoon.
Thank you in advance for your understanding and we look forward to hearing from you.
I went to London last week for business and, loving theatre very much, I had promised my friend to give her, after work, a very good evening at your musical show: "Over the Rainbow".
But Pat could not keep it very long. He had a fault: he talked a lot and told another friend our secret. What a catastrophe! All the children left  the village and wanted to play with us. I accepted them but I was very angry with Pat. Our peace disappeared and very soon everybody wanted to command my ship. A disaster!
I would be really happy if I could choose singing and photography from  activities you have listed. Singing has been my only hobby since I was 5. I could say that I am quite good at it. Also, I used to assist my brother, who is a professional photographer, so  I consider myself fairly experienced.
The advertisement says that Danny Brook and Tina Truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because I was looking forward to them. The times were also not alright, actually the show starts at 19.30 but on this evening it started at 20.15. The advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
But I think for my generation there is not a really big difference, in comparison to my grandparents who have real problems accepting these changes in modern technology. Because the biggest developments were in the last 50 years.
Thank you very much for this opportunity. I'd like to travel only in July, because, for the rest of the year, I'm working in a bank. The second reason is the weather. I love travelling when the weather is warm. Regarding the accommodation, I'd prefer to stay in a log cabin, because it is more comfortable for me and my family. I have a baby and three dogs, so it should be better in a log cabin.
The concert was absolutely fantastic. I was so glad, because at the end of the show the singer kissed me and dedicated a lovely song to me. Can you imagine? OK, write to me soon, huge hug and kisses
1. First of all, I was really furious about watching a show starring  a different actor, instead of Danny Brook, whose name was given in the advertisement. Besides this, the show started almost 45 minutes later than  it was meant to start.
Considering all the above points, I would like to ask for some money back. I will consider taking this complaint to  court if I do not receive an acceptable explanation from the theatre. Thank You.
The future is the hope and the dream for everyone on the earth. Therefore, I will suggest that we all  to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation.
After having thought about this video and asked various people so as to know what they suggested, I reached the following conclusions: we must film the lessons which are the most important and the activities which take up a great part of a day at school; this being in three parts.
That is why I propose to start our film with the beginning of the day, when all the students come into the classroom. Then, we should film the English class so as to show who made the film. Furthermore, as mathematics is the main lesson in the morning, we ought to film at a time when we are in the maths class.
As I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had. First, the actors that the Circle theatre publicised on their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors  starring in the musical were one of its major attractions. Another point that I want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was  major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered  your food  unhealthy, and I am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
For the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important thing for me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best.
Science and Technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life. And I think it's the same for me, because when advances in technology, like computers, Internet, etc., were made, it changed my life as a high school student.
To answer the question: "How has modern technology changed my daily life?", I can confirm that it has been in many ways, and the most important one that I can remember was the invention of computers and later the Internet, because it was easier for me, and for everyone, to do your homework, , and, in fact, it was easier for me to search for information that in the past I would have to look up in a library. But not everything about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a  way, have become computers' and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and I am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and I accept that they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
Technology, in fact,  has meant an improvement regarding daily tasks, but we have to think and work by ourselves because if not our brains will become atrophied.
These days, there are so many people who like shopping that it is one of the important parts of our life. It is not, however, always enjoyable and there are both advantages and disadvantages.
To sum up, shopping is a very important part of our life and we can have a lot of fun, however it is not always enjoyable which means we cannot find only advantages to it.
About accommodation, I would prefer a log cabin, because I have a problem with my back. Therefore, I need to sleep in a bed. Also tents are not very comfortable.
The most suitable time for me is July because in August I intend to go to the countryside, where I have a small farm. In September my school starts a new study year. So, because of that I can only  then.
You'd like to know how the Top-Pop Concert was, which I helped to organise last month. It was absolutely great! I was responsible for the security of one of the sectors. I gave information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points. I was also asked about the timetable of the concert and I looked for drugs, knives and so on in bags. Although I worked I watched the concert. It was great fun! People danced, screamed and sang with the singer. I looked very carefully at the organisation of the event, you know I'm interested in it.
I was so surprised to hear from you. I couldn't believe that I had won the first prize in the competition. I'm so happy because it is the first time that I have won something.
Here  is all your information. I would like it if I could have my vacation  in July because it is the only time of the year that my employer will let me have a vacation. As for the accommodation I would prefer the tent because it will be the first time that I've been  camping and I would like to see . I was so thrilled when I saw that I could do some activities as well. I would like to choose swimming and  climbing. I'm a very good swimmer but I don't know anything about climbing. That's why I chose it because I want to try something new. Finally I would like to ask you about my clothes and what the weather is going to be like and what kind of clothes I must take with me. That is all.
As I mentioned to you before, a friend of mine  is a stage assistant and she needed  help with that pop concert last month.
The waterfall was made from real rock so that was the worst bit because it was really heavy and we had to carry it, but at the end of the month when the concert started, it was all over.
Firstly, the title 'International Arts Festival' is very suitable for the festival, because there was some variety of  there. Next, one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is also a fantastic idea, because everyone could enjoy everything with that ticket.
However, according to my notes, there are some doubts about the festival. While you stated that there were stars and artists from around the world, they were in fact only from six countries. The number of plays and films was also very small. In addition to that some concert halls were too small for the audience to enjoy the concerts.
With regard to your letter, I am writing to give you  the information you need to know regarding my stay of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
I am very excited and looking forward to the new experience I am going to have. First of all I must tell you that I only have free time in July -  on any day, any week - because I am still having my lessons at college and they will be finished at the end of June, and also in August I have a training course for my studies. I would prefer to stay in tents because I love the atmosphere of camping, but I wouldn't mind staying in log cabins. For the two activities I can choose, I would like to do swimming and Basketball. I have always found these kinds of activity make me feel strong and I enjoy doing them. I first started playing basketball and swimming when I was aged 9, and I have been doing both up till now. I was also in a basketball team in school for 3 years.
The aim of this report is to describe and assess which lessons and activities should be filmed for a short video. It is based on information made available by students from each class at school.
Most students who were interviewed suggested having a speaking part in the lesson that is to be on film. It seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with their partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times. It was felt to be a good memory to be reminded and to remind us to speak in a correct way. This lesson will help us to be relaxed and have a laugh. We also would like to have a history one.
Firstly, I should say that I would like to travel in July because  that is the month which I could most likely have off from work  to go on holiday.
Secondly, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than a tent. That is because, I do not want to seem fussy, but I like to have some luxuries when I am going on holiday and I think sleeping on the floor without electricity  may annoy me.
 I would like to know some information which could be useful on my holiday like: what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the Camp? Could I need some extra money? Do I need to bring anything else? If  so, please let me know as soon as possible.
I am writing to tell you about my experience at the pop concert last month, where I was helping my friend Nick, who was the bouncer at the venue.
It was a charity concert to raise money for poor people in AFRICA.
I think it was very clever of me to record that moment which I will never ever forget, and that was the thing that I liked most about that experience.
First of all, I don't think it's professional to change the principal actor at the last minute, the play should have been with Danny Brook, but it wasn't.
And it has not ended. I hope that in my thirties I'll go to Mars on holiday...
That is everything I have thought of concerning the festival. I would be grateful if you could think about it.
Speaking of rules, most of them are annoying! There're plenty of rules in my high school. For example, girls must keep the length of their skirts  5 cm below their knees. That's so stupid! It doesn't interfere with studying, does it? And also we're not allowed to bring any sweets. I know some rules are necessary to control the students. The school uniform is a good example. And the advantage of this is I don't need to think about what to put on every morning!
I am writing to give you further information about me which you need for Camp California.
Concerning  the activities which I have to choose I would like to inform you that I am fond of photography and I am quite good at it because I have attended a relevant course for three months.
Because of my work experience as a lifeguard I will choose swimming as the second activity.
I am afraid I can only make it in July, because I am taking exams this month. Moreover, I'll prepare everything for going to University in August. I have no time until Christmas. So, I think the best time is July.
As I was asked, I spoke to a number of students about their opinions concerning this short video. I found that most of them suggested that four lessons should be filmed, which are as follow:
I'm not really sure about what kind of clothes to take. Could you please write to me specifying what would be suitable? I'd appreciate it a lot.
It would be a pleasure to us and to your husband to come to the party. All the students wanted to organise a surprise party for Mr Brown. Next Tuesday is his birthday. We would like you to come and, if you can, to help us with an important decision.
Secondly, the party will take place on Tuesday 16th of June in the college canteen. We think a suitable time will be 3-6 p.m. You can come earlier, if you want. We would have junk food, some juices and drinks. Moreover, some teachers will come, of course all the students and the Principal.
Please try to come and help us with this problem. We are looking forward to your reply.
Then we had an idea! We would have a lot of money from the work. At the end of the summer we are planning to visit a cousin who lives in Australia. We imagine that will be the best holiday of our life.
First of all, we are happy to have won the first prize in your competition. Thank you for choosing our ticket .
We would like to go in July, because my wife Catrin . We would prefer the last two weeks in July. Would that be fine for you too?
It would be great if we could choose swimming and golf. My wife Catrin is a local champion in swimming races. I'm not so good as her, but I go once every week to her training session. At golf, we are both total beginners. We have no experience but we would like to learn this game.
We are both a little worried.  What kind of clothes and shoes do we have to take  with us? What will the temperature be in the summer season in this area? Is there any possibility we could rent  golf shoes?
You are interested in my last job! I really want to tell you all about my experience.
However, I'm happy that we have finished this hard work. I worked in a team of seven people. We were mainly  working on all the lights at this great concert. It sounds easy, just doing the lighting.
In addition, it was  nine days of hard work to mount all the different spot and hundreds of Coblights in the right place.
Finally, we worked the whole night before the concert. We had to adjust the laser extremely carefully  to get it in the correct position. We spent hours on this till it was good enough for the technical manager. Moreover, the band was exhausted by this great laser show in the end.
Have you ever spent more money than you should during a visit to the shopping center? If you answered no, congratulations. But if you took a deep breath after reading the question, don't worry. It's normal to have spending sprees. Everyone has had or will have one while shopping. But don't be afraid.
Paul told Pat not to tell anyone about Madonna and especially not the press. Pat obviously couldn't keep silent about this so, since he also needed some money, he decided to reveal everything to the scandal-mongering press, not knowing that Paul had made up the whole story! On Sunday all the English press were waiting for Madonna in front of Paul's hotel and when they discovered that it was all a hoax, they got so angry that they wrote in every newspaper that Pat had made up everything! Paul finally had his revenge!!
My name is Manuel Olmez and last week I went to see the musical show 'Over the rainbow' at the Circle theatre.
I would like to travel only in July, because in June I have to study at school, which doesn't finish until the end of June. For August, I have already made another appointment with my friends. We are going to visit the places of interest in China. As usual, our new term begins in September. I can only travel in July
The aim of this report is to suggest which lessons and  should be filmed for a short video. In order to write the report I interviewed about one hundred students who are studying in our English class.
With this letter I want to explain to you some problems I had last week at your theatre with your show. First of all, I want to introduce myself. I'm Francesco Schein, I'm 18 years old and I went last week to see your musical show "Over the Rainbow". I was very upset because the show had many problems.
Now, I will answer your questions. In reference to the date of  travel, I would like to travel in July because at the moment I am working at  University and I only have July to take my holidays.
About camp activities, I would prefer to do basketball and photography. I have chosen these activities because these days I am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby. I have recently bought a new camera.
My duties as a staff member were various. The first day I had to pick the bands up from the airport, and for this I hired a van. The following day I was the person who provided the meals for all the  staff and also every day I was  backstage supporting the catering staff.
Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you to complain about the musical show I went to see last Wednesday. I was told I would have the most perfect evening in London, but it was not. When I bought my ticket I expected to be able to take advantage of those discounts you announced in the newspaper advertisement but then I had to pay the most expensive price. I went to see the 19:30 performance but it did not start until 20:15! I was really angry but I wanted to see Danny Brook. My surprise was when, instead of Mr. Brook, a different actor appeared on stage. At the end of the show I decided to go to the theatre restaurant but when I arrived I realized it was closed because the  show had finished too late! All I am asking for is a full refund of the money I spent on the musical. I look forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully,
Now I am planning to be a good photographer. I will use some photographs to put on a website that belongs to a magazine, which .
. How much money would you like to pay me for working with children for five hours a day for two weeks?
Last month, I worked as a roadie at a Rolling Stones pop concert. I was responsible for the sound . Now, I have some experience in producing live DCs of famous bands, I would like to do it. I hope  to be a producer of shows, as soon as possible.
I have chosen photography and climbing as my activities. I am a beginner in photography but I am really interested in it. I have a medium level of proficiency in climbing and I would like to climb the Californian mountains.
I like Danny Brook as an actor and when I read that he would be starring, I booked the ticket immediately. But, instead there was a different actor, who I had never heard of before!
But the invention that I'm most thankful for is the computer and the Internet! Thanks to them, I can easily communicate with my family and friends at home when I'm here in England. It's so quick and not too expensive either. To use the mobile phone, by the way, is very expensive. I usually use it for sending SMS Messages to my friends.
It was supposed to start at ten, but when the band was going on stage, the singer fell down on some wires that gave the power to all the instruments and all the lights! Suddenly, everything got very dark. The fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while I just stood there trying to see what had happened. Then, a security guard started calling for help. I happened to be near him, so I went to help him. He asked me to help Bono, the singer, get up and to get him some water. I realised he had broken a finger so I had to get a doctor to help him. There was an ambulance behind the stage, so the paramedic came right away and took care of Bono's finger. About an hour later, he recovered and the show began.
She really listened to me and told me that I was doing the right thing and persuaded me to send in my application to a language course in England.
Choosing only two activities from such a variety of interesting ones was quite hard, but I decided to pick the two I've never tried, climbing and surfing.
Forgive me for the long time I left you without any news. I wrote to you last time that I was going to lend a hand with the installation and preparation of "Garbage's" concert and you asked me to tell you how it was.
I am writing in reply to your letter, which I received last week, and in fact I am very surprised and pleased with the prize.
Secondly, regarding accommodation, I would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because I used to use a tent on holiday and I haven't .
In addition, I work every summer as a  at the leisure centre in my town.
Once, when we first met, I was about 15 and she was the same age, we started talking and by the time we had finished we found out that we had formed a very good friendship through our conversation.
The next morning when I got to the high school I heard what I wasn't expecting, Pat had told everybody about my first experience of kissing. People were staring at me and laughing.
I've already decided when I want to take a part at The Camp California in USA. The most suitable time for this trip is only in July, because I've already planned the rest of my summer holidays. In June and August, so that's the only time when I can travel there.
I am replying to your letter about the first prize in the competition that I won and there are a number of things I would like to make clear.
I must say that being at a concert is very nice. But helping at a concert is much nicer. At the end I realized that all you need is co-operation and you mustn't think selfishly. Hope to hear from you soon.
Well, on the whole, it was pretty cool. There was no big  about it. The only thing I was asked to do was to help carry the lunches of the singers and to help with light and sound management, when the guy there had to do something else. Oh yes, I also had to check the tickets for five minutes. The woman had to deliver something. The problem with this job is that you have to deal with huge numbers of people. There were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
How are you? I'm fine. Soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward to that but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot.
Now I want to tell you about a pop concert. As you already know I helped my father to organize this concert. I was doing a lot of things like redecorating, drawing. Sometimes I gave some advice about suits and dresses. Often we saw rehearsals and if something didn't appeal to us we tried to correct it. The most enjoyable thing was to dress people. We have a good and rich sponsor. That's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that piece of clothing which we thought was most suitable for their style. We always explained things to them and in the end they agreed with us. These days were so busy. But when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we . You should try it and see. I'll be waiting for your answer.
I'm writing to you to complain about the musical  that I saw when I went to the theatre during my holidays in London.
Most young people like Carol believe the same and use their minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future. After all, they'll be the ones that decide what the Fashion of the Future will be like.
I hope there will be no problem if I travel in July, as this is the only free period I have. In August, , I will start  a new job and I will not be able to leave Rome for a long time.
Being a woman, I naturally love shopping. It is a really great pleasure going in and out of different shops, trying on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally going back home with dozens of bags in your hands.
I have recently been to London for  a week's holiday. As I am a fan of musicals I went to see this  show.
I am very disappointed because the things that were written in the advertisement were not really true.
It was also written that there were discounts available and I asked about them and they said  that they weren't allowed to give any discount. After the show me and my friends wanted to have a drink and the theatre restaurant was closed because there weren't enough drinks.
On the one hand, nowadays if we have to travel to Paris and return on the same day you can take a plane without any problem. In the past it was impossible to go to Paris from Barcelona and come back in one day.
If it's possible I would like to travel in July because of my job. I can't leave it until that month and I'm not able to travel at any other time of  year.
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer a log cabin. It would be nicer and safer for me than the tents. The activities I would like to choose are swimming and sailing. It could be fun for me because I like swimming, and sailing could be exciting too.
In the following paragraphs I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of shopping.
Dear Sir or Madam, With reference to your advertisement regarding the musical show "Over the rainbow" I am writing to you with the intention of giving you an impression of our experiences attending the above-mentioned show. We were disappointed to realize that not Danny Brook but a different actor played one of the main characters. Honestly it was a less impressive performance than we had expected. According to your advertisement the play should have started at 19:30. Unfortunately there was an unexplained delay of 45 minutes. The audience had to sit and wait until 20:15. What made the situation worse is that no explanation for the delay was given; not even an apology. We had been told that discounts on the ticket prices were available but on the evening of the show no discounts or special offers whatsoever were offered. After the show we had intended to visit your theatre restaurant, which was - to our surprise - closed because of the  delay! So we had to leave hungry and with a certain feeling of frustration and disappointment. Honestly for us it was not that "perfect evening out". We would like to ask you if there is any chance of getting our money back  or if you can offer any other alternative ? We are looking forward to hearing from you. Yours faithfully M. S.
I would like to travel in  July only because I'll be free for the whole month. So any date in  July. I'd like to stay at Camp California in tents, because I like to sleep in a tent when I go camping. Also I would like to choose the two activities from the list that you have given me. I would like to choose Swimming and Photography. I'm good at swimming. I used to swim for the school team. But I have never done photography before. I love to take  photos but never have a chance to do so. But I have a chance to choose.
That's all I did at the pop concert for my . What about your experience? Don't forget to tell me about yours, okay... Better go to sleep now. Bye
I'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programme for our English class in London, especially for the river trip to Greenwich. It will be a great experience for us. But the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London Fashion and Leisure Show", which will take place in the Central Exhibition Hall, London, on Tuesday March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. At the same time we have to go to the Science Museum but we would all like to go to the show. It will be very interesting for us to see the latest fashions, make-up, and hairstyles and we can speak to English people and make new friends. There is one more advantage: it is free for students. So we would like to suggest  how the programme could be changed.
First of all I want to wish your cousin a happy fifteenth birthday and wish her all the best. I hope that it will be a good holiday for her, her family and friends.
Now about your questions, it is very difficult for me to give any advice  about it. I don't know your cousin very well so I don't know what she prefers reading. But when I was fifteen my favourite book was "The Best Detective Stories of Agatha Christie". So I can recommend you give her this book, because it is a very interesting, amusing, sometimes dramatic and mysterious book. This book helps us to improve our , mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
I am writing to complain about your musical show "Over the Rainbow". Last week I was on holiday in London and I was very disappointed when I visited your theatre.
Moreover, the advertisement says that discounts will be available on the price of the ticket, but when I asked for one they told me that there weren't any.
I would like to book my tickets for the beginning of July. The 3rd of July will suit  me.
I would like to choose surfing as my second activity. I've never done it before. I'd like to get some lessons if it's possible. I've seen how people do it but I've never tried it myself.
Maybe you will spend all your money on a new thing and a few hours later your best friend will invite you to go to a night-club but you will be short of money. Some people will do crazy things in a situation like this. They will hate this new thing because they will miss a party.
Moreover, I was unable to use the theatre restaurant as it had been closed for redecoration!
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. Everyone had soon heard about me getting the secret access code for the 'Secret Society' organisation.
This was the kind of association everybody knew about but nobody talked about. Everyone was aware that talking aloud about the 'Secret Society' could get you in trouble, serious trouble. There had been cases when somebody entered the club but never came back afterwards.
I am writing to you because I am very glad about my first place in the competition. I am going to tell you about the things that you ask me about in your letter.
I would like to travel in July because it is the perfect time to go to the camp and it is summer.
Furthermore, for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I have been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college as the captain.
It wasn't very exciting work but you could meet a lot of pop Artists, which was the good thing about it because they gave away their T-shirts, also I could chat with them for a few minutes. Another good thing was that all the people wanted to be in your place and they were very jealous of me.
In your letter you presented the possibility of choosing two activities and I would like to let you know that I would be pleased if I could join in with basketball and climbing, as I am very good at both of them because I played basketball in my secondary school as captain of the team and due to my long training sessions  lifting weights.
Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear  the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien on their territory.
There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like. All this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay. If this wasn't enough your strength and mental health can be completely destroyed when, despite having been robbed, having spent hours walking around and being tired and hungry, you finally buy something you really like with your credit card and, after having walked a few blocks, you see the same item at half the price in another shop.
I'm the winner of the first prize in your competition and I'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you.
If I can choose my accommodation I would prefer a log cabin, because when I've been on campsites before, it always has been in tents, then I'd like to change and try this other kind of accommodation.
It's really difficult to choose two activities from that list. Every one is very interesting. Anyway, I think basketball could be the right choice because it's the sport that I've been playing since I was a child, and photography because it's my hobby in my free time. I really enjoy it and I can say I'm  good at it.
Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours  shopping and not find what you are looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable for you. Another common problem could be the long queue in the fitting rooms, where you wait standing up for your turn. After that, there is the unfriendly and sometimes impolite shop assistant who gets on your nerves . But never mind! The worst is when you get  home in the evening and find a chair to sit in because your feet are killing you and you realize you have spent all your money without buying the stuff that you need to cook tonight.
I am writing this letter to inform you about the decisions I have made regarding your questions.
First of all I would like to travel in July because I will  have finished my exams by the end of June. I will not be able to travel in August because I have found a job for that month.
Basketball and swimming are the two activities I have chosen. I have played basketball since I was twelve years old and I have been a member of the school basketball team for four years. In swimming I won the first prize in a local competition.
I am writing to complain about the problems   at your musical show.
Apart from this, there is more. After the show I went to the theatre restaurant but it was closed because the chef of the restaurant was ill. This is not an excuse.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. One day Brian, Pat's best friend, told him a secret. It was an important secret for Brian. He told him that he was in love with Jane, a girl in their class. Jane was a very good girl and she liked Brian. Pat told this secret to Beth, Jane's best friend. He didn't tell her the secret because he wanted to hurt Brian but because he wanted to help him. Brian was very embarrassed to ask Jane out on a date.
When Pat heard the good news he told  Brian to ask her out on a date and he knew that she would accept.
I was also expecting to see the actor Danny Brook performing, but a different actor did, who did not perform as well as Danny Brook does. This was another disappointing thing about that evening.
In the first place, when  people think only about going  shopping they forget other things: playing with their children, talking with their parents, friends.
Last week my son and I went to see Over the rainbow at the Circle theatre. We paid to see Danny Brook, my son's favourite actor, but we were quite disappointed. My son was very happy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time. However, that's just the beginning of the problems we had. Expecting  British punctuality, we went to the theatre at 19:00 to watch the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15. It finished later than it was supposed to and then we missed the train. I didn't see any discounts available; I thought my son would have paid less than I. As we had already missed the first  we went to the theatre restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
Because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work hard so that this theatre, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganised shows.
People have seen in the last 10 years how different our clothes can become . Clothes  used to be made of cotton, but nowadays we can see shirts, pants, socks....made of almost anything. It is a revolution in  fashion that is starting now. Nowadays we have  a kind of clothes that keep the temperature of our bodies , and clothes that don't get wet or even dirty. Computers are little things  nowadays, but at the speed at which technology develops, in the next century  clothes will tell our doctors about our health at any moment, any time, anywhere, people will be able to locate us around the world. In the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even colour. Our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the weather, our  , all our needs. It has already started and has no limits .
, I'm an absolute beginner at playing tennis and I'm not fit enough for running but I chose it because it is a sport I've always wanted to learn BUT I'VE NEVER HAD enough free time.
And if this is a problem for me, imagine how bad a very fat woman (or man) would feel.
Often they must go to special shops to buy their clothes. It looks like a sort of racism and unfortunately our society looks for beauty. Just think about commercials. They're full of perfect people. The sort of people you will never find in real life.
First of all, the reason that we decided to have this party was because Mr Brown helped with the organisation of our trip to France. And we would appreciate your not telling him about our party.
Secondly, the party  is on Tuesday 16th in the evening at the college canteen. As regards the food, our mothers  will help with that. Also, we will take the drinks  from our canteen and there will be a group of musicians for our entertainment.
Moreover, all the class, our teachers and the Principal will come to the party of course. Finally, I would like to ask you about our present. Should we buy a book or a CD-player?
I hope that I have been of some help to you with the party. I look forward to seeing you there.
All  night I did not sleep at all. I was in the office by 6.30 pm. The executive called me into the office, and he showed me my office.
From, that day, every day I went to the office 30 minutes early. When I completed a month in this job my executive  told  John to go to the office. I was surprised because I did not know what he wanted. When I went he wanted to tell me that from the next month I would be his personal secretary and my salary  would be twice what it was  previously. I could not believe it.
I recently had a week's holiday in London and went to see a musical show at your theatre with a friend. We had seen your advertisement for the show, which made it seem very attractive.
The star had been changed, the show had started  at 20:15, and there were no discounts available. Also the Theatre Restaurant was closed for renovation. And your last phrase in the advertisement was "Your perfect evening out"! It wasn't that at all, as I have explained to you above in this letter.
When I began  working in an Insurance Company, I had only an old typewriter, which made a lot of noise and was very difficult to write with  because the buttons were hard on my small fingers. Now I have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also faster. But when the computer doesn't work, I have a big problem doing my work.
Also now  it is better to use the Internet to write a letter to a friend overseas. It is so practical, in five minutes my friend can read my letter. And he can answer me very quickly. I think it is now the future of  big companies  to work with the Internet.
It was very difficult to choose only two of those fascinating activities, but I made a decision, which is Golf and Photography. Since my hobby is taking photos I am very interested in this field and have studied by myself about it. But Golf is an absolutely new trial. I can imagine myself playing Golf on those beautiful Californian golf-courses. Even though I'm poorly skilled.
 I wonder what else I have to pack to go there. Inform me if I have to bring special dresses or only outdoor clothes, and also if it is necessary to bring some money with me.
Then the concert started, I was called by one of the staff for help, finally I could get into the stadium. The next task I was given was ironing costumes. Can you imagine that I touched all of the costumes the singer wore?
I am writing to inform you of some problems we had. I went to the theatre to see "Over The Rainbow" on 17th June.
First of all, we went to the ticket office to get the tickets. I thought we could buy discounts tickets because of the advertisement. However, we couldn't . Eventually, we got the tickets, because we wanted to see the musical and Danny Brook. When we arrived at the theatre, we were very disappointed, because a different actor performed in the musical that day. In addition, it started at 20:15. We had to wait over 40 minutes and we couldn't enjoy dinner at the theatre restaurant after the show.
I have recently been on a holiday to London. During my stay I went to see the musical "Over the Rainbow". Now I want to complain about a few things which made me very disappointed.
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? In what way will they change? Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy about that.
I gave it some thought the other day and when I think about future-clothing I can't take my mind off plastic fabrics. My conclusion is that people will wear less and thinner clothes.
I write this letter to you  to describe the very bad evening I have had in your theatre. In the paper it was written that the principal actor is "Danny Brook" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor whom we had never seen, or heard. I think it's really not right.
But I am not finished, you wrote in the paper "Discounts available" but it wasn't true; it was  very badly organised. After this bad show we had wanted to go to the Restaurant for a drink and to eat something and it was closed and nobody explained to us why the Restaurant wasn't open.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, this sentence is very popular in our school. Pat is not an  girl. She is very friendly but she can't keep a secret. Last year, on a Saturday evening, my boyfriend phoned me at 20 h  and said to me, "Would you like to go to the cinema with me." I asked my parents but they said to me, "No, you can't go to the cinema, tomorrow you have school." Then I phoned  Pat  to explain my big problem. Pat said to me, "You say to your parents that you will sleep with me and you aren't going to the cinema." I asked my parents and they said, "Alright you can go to Pat's  to sleep." I was very happy, I phoned  my boyfriend and I told him my secret. He said, "Alright, so at nine o'clock in front of the cinema". I spent a really beautiful evening with Pat and my boyfriend in the cinema, but on Sunday my mother phoned Pat's mother and Pat's mother explained the whole story to my mother. If Pat hadn't told her mother the secret I would  not have had  a problem. Since that Saturday evening I have never spoken to Pat.
To answer your first question, I would like to travel in July if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at that time of the year.
Regarding the accommodation at Camp California, I prefer to rent a tent, which is going to be more fun, I think, but are the tents singles? I would be pleased if you could give me details about this question.
I can see on the list a lot of interesting sports! But I think (it's difficult to choose) I'll choose golf and basketball, golf because I'm quite good(I finished 5th in the English Junior Golf Tournament  in 1999), and basketball, because I would like to rediscover this sport I only used to play at school.
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.
Last Saturday evening I had a wonderful time. The motorbike club in our town organized a pop concert. A girlfriend of a member of the club asked me if I would like to help at the information desk. I did not hesitate one moment.
Today I have to tell you something really exciting and also very hard to believe. Last month I received a letter which told me that I'd won a competition. I was so happy and surprised that first I could not really believe it.  But it was true. My prize was the chance to meet a pop group and to help at their concert. The pop group which was going to play is called "Metallica" and I like their music very much ('cause in my opinion the music is a bit different from all the songs you usually listen to). But now to the concert itself. It took place on the 10th of June in Salzburg. It started at 8 pm but I had to be there at 11 am. First I had to help with the catering, which lasted until 2 pm. After this I met the band members and got to know them while we were having a good meal. The front man felt a bit sick and so he skipped the meal. I was so excited that I was not able to eat anything either. At 5 pm the band members disappeared again and I was responsible for some kind of guided tour for the journalists. I had to show them the way to the interviewing room. It was a bit boring but more or less okay. At 7 p.m. the first group started. They were unknown and not very good but when I met them afterwards I realised that they were very nice. At 8 pm Metallica started and, I have to tell you, they gave a great performance. When I met them after the concert they asked me questions like "Did you like the performance?" or "What do you think about the first group?" Questions like you and I usually ask each other. You know what I mean.  They were not conceited or anything like that. They were like  other people and I have to admit that I like them very much. This was one of the best and most exciting days of my life.
Firstly, I will be available for travelling only in July because my university will finish at the end of June and will start again in August. Secondly, regarding the accommodation, I would say I prefer living in a tent rather than in a log cabin because I used to sleep in a tent when I was staying in a local scout camp in my country. Thirdly, I have chosen Sailing and Photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favourite hobbies and I have been enjoying Sailing and Photography for several years so I am quite good at both of them. Finally, I would like to ask you whether I have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
I look forward to receiving the details regarding the trip soon and to joining your camp in July.
Sometimes shopping doesn't do anything for you but only wastes all your free time. A group of girls can stay in a shopping centre forever. It seems to me that more people in my hometown tend to go shopping in their free time because the shopping complexes nowadays are more attractive and combine every facility inside. From my point of view, someone goes shopping just because he/she wants to show off that he/she is wealthy.
I didn't have a computer until I was eight. Then my brother and I started to develop a new ability. At that time I used the computer only to play  video games.
I also would prefer to sleep in  tents, which are more comfortable, and, because I have been doing lots of camping, I am quite used to this kind of accommodation.
We were very disappointed to hear that the actor was replaced by another one at the last minute. The advertisement said that it starts at 19.30, but it actually started at 20:15 due to a problem with the sound. We were also surprised to discover that the student discounts weren't available for us, because they didn't accept our student identity cards from Switzerland.
Could you figure out how your life would be without  modern technology? What is the effect  it has on your environment? Were  people happier in the past than today? If you are interested in the question, you will be interested in this article.
Nowadays,  technology takes up a large part of your daily life and improves the speed of . For example at work, we look at the computer screen all day, sending e-mail to the other side of the world, doing some research etc. We gain a lot of time with the computer, but if your computer broke down, you couldn't do anything because everything is on it.
The major problem for the industrial cities is to deal with the bad effects of pollution on the environment. A lot of money is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of pollution.
To sum up, all the improvements come at a price: the condition of the environment. We are too dependent on technology today. But we can ask ourselves, "What will  happen in 50 years?" Our children will be able to travel to the moon as we travel to Japan?
When the play was finished I was looking for your theatre restaurant but it was closed because, as was written on the paper that was on the door, it was too late.
It all started when she was fifteen, when she started a new course in the institute and met some girls that in time  would become her friends.
Three years passed and, as is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them, as her friends knew a lot about her
She had to repeat that course and all her friends passed and as is usual the girls from the last course became popular.
 an example, the Kimono (traditional Japanese clothing) will be worn not only in Japan but also in other countries in general.
Through one country's traditional clothing   of another country, .
What will clothes be like 100 years from now? This question is not simple to answer. On the one hand, science and technology have been developing rapidly, and God knows what new materials will be invented in the future. We probably will be wearing dresses made of synthetic  cloth in 2100. Of course, these new materials won't be so harmful to our health as today's nylon and other things like that.
And it is even more difficult to predict what  clothes in the future will look like. People's  imaginations are enormous.
I am writing to complain about the musical  which was performed at The Circle Theatre last week. I saw the performance and it was not as it was described in the advertisement I read in the local newspaper.
What was supposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time. So I would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the money I spent on the tickets.
Computers, radio, CDs, satellite television and a lot of other things have changed my daily life. Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects of my life, and it has some advantages as well as some disadvantages.
On the one hand, technology is a great help for me at school. What I mean is that computers are very useful for doing my homework (like some  or research). And I can't even think  what it would be like not having a computer. Another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me  informed about what is happening in the whole world.
Next, students during the break in the yard should be filmed. It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how they are as young people. Students chatting, laughing, eating and even smoking must remain in the video.
I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things: I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot with these things.
In music, before I had a computer I could only write my compositions and 'listen' to them in my mind, because, of course, I haven't got an orchestra to play them, but now I can just record one part, and then another part, and then another one.. and I can get the sound of every instrument, controlling it with a keyboard, or even create new sounds.
I have happily received your reply  and I want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me. Now to answer your questions, I can only travel in July because that's the only month of the year I can get out of working for more than two weeks. I would like a log cabin because I think you should provide me with good accommodation and not just a tent to sleep in, with no electricity or entertainment. I would like to play basketball and tennis . I am a regular basketball player. Most of the time I play as a slammer and I do feel that I'm reasonably good at it. As to tennis I'm the best player in my whole school and, once, I got into the top 10 of my country's  tennis players.
How are you? I have just received your letter and let me tell you what you missed over here. You should have been here, it was amazing. The concert began at 8:00 p.m but my friends and I had to be there by 2:00 pm to help set up the stage. We started by putting up the lights. We had to climb up to 15m to put up those lights and afterwards the band didn't even use them. Well, we also had to carry all the instruments up onto the stage and, believe me, that was the hardest bit of all. They were extremely heavy and there were a lot of them on the bus. After helping to do that and many other things, my friends and I watched the concert and before Green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands. I'll never wash my hand again. Well that's all the time I've got for you now. Hope to hear from you soon.
I have also read that the show was supposed to start at 19:30 but it didn't. It started at 20:15 leaving us waiting for forty five minutes. You have also advertised that there would be discounts available but there weren't and that we could visit the theatre restaurant after the show but it was closed because they were redecorating it. In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening at the show very unpleasant.
Also the clothes in a hundred years will have the ability to cool down the people who wear them in the summer and the same clothes will keep them warm on cold winters' days.
As you can realise, I think the future's clothes will be adjusted not  only according to fashion and the seasons but to the needs of every .
With reference to the date, I can only go in July, as I'm going off on holiday in August, and I start university in September. The place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
It's very nice of you to let me choose my favourite activities. The ones I'm most keen on are tennis, at which I think I'm pretty good since I took some classes last year, and painting, which is one of my favourite hobbies, and helps me to relax  and forget about problems. I think I'm not bad at painting either; at least everyone in my family likes my work, including myself.
If it is possible I want a log cabin for my accommodation because I have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore I need a comfortable place to sleep.
I will be pleased to swim and paint when I am at the camp. I selected swimming because it is a cure for my backache and I have not done it since I started my new job five years ago. I also chose painting because I have never done it before. I would like to learn and moreover I want to do a relaxing activity.
I am writing to you in connection with our next programme in London from 13th March to 14th March. First of all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.
Believe it or not, our lives are changing and becoming more complicated every day. The reason for all of this  is the  introduction of the "new technologies", such as computers, the Internet or WAP technologies.
Nowadays shopping can be very stressful. It all starts with the search for an appropriate parking-space which can last annoyingly long, especially at weekends.
Nevertheless, the nightmare starts when you enter the shopping mall or the passage, which is terribly crowded. You cannot make a step without "touching"  others. It gets enormously unbearable on hot summer days, when the temperature increases. In such a situation your friends or the people you are shopping with get lost very easily and looking for them can be very tiring. But the worst moment comes if you cannot find the thing you were looking for, because it is no longer trendy or because it is sold out.
There are a lot of new modern technologies around the world, which appeared not long ago. Among them, the mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house. All of them play a very great role in people's daily life. The first change is that they greatly simplify the life of people. For example, now women don't spend a lot of time in the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing  dishes. They can just turn on their dishwashers and go to do something that they think more pleasant. So with the appearance of new modern technology people have got much more free time. The computer also plays a very important role in the daily life of people. Some years ago people, especially students, had to run to libraries in order to find a book about something. But now they can use the Internet, where you can find any information you need. I use the Internet very often, and I must say it is very convenient. Another piece of modern technology that I use is a mobile telephone.
If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, or if something terrible has happened to me, I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box. I just use my mobile phone. Finally, I can say that modern technology really helps people in their work. With it people do their work more quickly and successfully.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, in fact she was so bad at that she got me in  trouble. Once I was on vacation with her in America, in Chicago to be exact. We stayed  with a host family in a suburb of the city. We spent three weeks over there, the weather was great, the people we met were very interesting so everything was perfect. We mostly had a wonderful time. We went there 3 years ago and I was only 19 years old and as everyone knows  the age of majority, when you are able to go out in the USA, is 21 years old. If you  have not reached your majority you aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or, even worse, to go into a bar. So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and I decided to go  to a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in . At the entrance, the security guard asked for my identity card, Pat gave hers and told him that I'd left it at home. The man said it was OK  this time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it. It was such  fun, we met a lot of different people, we danced, we had a wonderful time. After a few hours of dancing we started to get thirsty. We went to the bar and asked for an alcoholic drink. Of course by the time we got  it we had forgotten all the stuff about the majority. The barman asked me my age and Pat told him without thinking  19 years old! Then she realized but it was too late. The manager came, he called the police and the beginning of a great evening ended with a night in jail and an expensive fine! Thank you Pat for keeping a secret so well!!
During my last holiday  in London I went to the Circle Theatre after reading the advertisement for the "Over the rainbow" show. I wanted to spend my free time well by taking in that cultural event. How stupid of me! I felt really disappointed. First of all, in the advertisement it was written, as I had read  before, that Danny Brook would be starring in the show. Unfortunately, a different actor stood in for  him.  was written as half past two p.m. and  half past seven that evening, again. Lack of  time made me go to the evening show. And unfortunately again, for some reason, it was delayed until quarter past eight. Another problem - in the advertisement it was definitely written that there were some  discounts on the tickets. No, alas, in reality it appeared to be a mistake. According to the advertisement, after the show anyone could go to the theatre restaurant for a drink. That appeared impossible, because the theatre restaurant was closed. The reason was unknown. That wasn't enough still. At the end of the advertisement  I noticed it said something about a perfect evening out. It wasn't true. That's why I am writing my letter to you and I am asking for my money back. I was expecting something much better. Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet in  court.
I believe, living in a modern country, that science and technology affect every aspect of my daily life. Looking back to the past, I can see how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine. People living in the past couldn't travel so much as we can now and couldn't  the news around the world as we do  now, in the present day. They could not communicate with someone living in another country,  located far away from their own. Using mobile phones, e-mails or the Internet, we have  better access to a lot of different information.
No one told you to be famous. If you are famous, it was your choice and therefore it is the price you have to pay. Of course you have fame and . But then everyone will recognise you when you are walking in the street.
I am a student at a technical university. Some time ago I did not know anything about the Internet. When I needed some information I had to go to the library to find it in books or newspapers. Now the only thing I have to do is to go to the computer room and turn on the computer. The computer is helpful when I want to contact somebody very fast. I just send an e-mail and that is all!
The last example is that I have a lot of modern equipment in my house, like a TV set, fridge and microwave which help me in my life.
I am writing on behalf of my classmates about the programme you have organised for us.
We all want to thank you for having chosen such good places in London. We are especially excited about the river trip to Greenwich which will be on the first day.
I would particularly like to talk about the second day. We really like the programme, but we have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion and Leisure Show that will take place on Tuesday and we are very interested in going. As you know our class is composed of girls and it would be very exciting for us if we could have a look at the latest fashions, makeup and so on.
Last summer I went to the Amazon on an expedition with 10 other people:  a guide, a doctor, a scientist & all the rest of us like me were just curious.
One day at five o'clock in the morning I stepped out of my tent without being seen and started walking towards the river, because I wanted to take some photographs of the sunrise. The view was taking my breath away when suddenly something took my breath away. It was a panther. I was petrified because it looked as if it was very hungry. I knew I could not make any movement for my safety but I did and to my surprise it ran away.
First of all, I will not have finished my university course until the end of  June so I can only travel in July. I would prefer to stay in a tent rather than a log cabin. Since I was a child, I have been interested in camping and sleeping in  tents.
If I can participate in swimming and photography groups, I will be grateful. I have been swimming for a club for 8 years and enjoy it a lot. I am afraid I am not good at photography but I want to improve .
Considering that the school's maths team won  this year's city maths competition and is going on to the national schools' maths championship, it would be a good idea to film some of their training courses and also ordinary maths lessons which the majority of the students attend.
I am writing to tell you that I had a very disappointing evening at a musical show at your theatre. There are some things that I was not completely satisfied with and I would like to point them out.
Firstly, the advertisement said that Danny Brook was going to star in the musical but it turned out to be a completely different person, which was very disappointing. It was very unprofessional of you to have  the wrong  in the paper. Secondly, according to the advertisement, the musical was supposed to start at 19.30 but it actually started at 20.15, which caused me  problems. As for my ticket, I was expecting to get a discount as a student, as it said I would in the advertisement. However, none was  available, which was very disappointing again. Then, I was hoping to have a meal at the theatre restaurant, which was recommended in the advertisement. However, it was not possible for me to do so as the restaurant was closed due to the staff vacation, which I thought was very unprofessional.
When Molly went back home to Aberdeen, she told Pat that she had met Vance and Sally in London. Then, suddenly,  to look confused and she said in a small voice, 'Didn't they break up a long time ago? Sally must have a new boyfriend'. As Molly didn't know this, she was so surprised and tried to ask more about it. Then, Pat realized that it was supposed to be kept  a secret but it just came out of her mouth! She didn't mean to do it, but this kind of thing happens a lot. Now Pat is feeling so guilty about what she has done because Molly isn't good at keeping secrets either! Everyone is going to know that Sally has been cheating both on Vance and her new boyfriend and  poor Vance is always the last person to know . 
Frankly, if I had a lot of money I would  spend my entire life  shopping. Although I am someone who loves shopping, I cannot stand  . However, everyone prefers to do the same thing and at the same time. It leads to overcrowded shops, high-pitched noise, a lack of parking places and if you have to go shopping with a child, the whole thing is just about enough to drive you crazy. Despite knowing the difficulty we do not avoid  shopping on those days. On the other hand, some companies offer special services, such as sending your order by  post or taking it on the telephone. It could be the way to avoid busy times or days. Do not take your child with you; choose the right shop which has a car park.
Dear Mr. Robertson Thank you for your good programme for the English class, especially since it is well-organised and has many different places we can go and we can see. All of us in the English class look forward to visiting these places. However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for in this week's college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting  London. It should be a great opportunity for us because we can see the latest fashions, leisure and sportswear, make-up and hairstyles. As you know, this year is our final year and most of us would like to get a job straight away after this course. We've been worried about our future career and we believe that we need some preparation for it such as advice about dress and hairstyle for an interview. And mostly, it should be a great opportunity for the Art students who are attending English class. Most  students in our class are studying Fashion  full-time. Especially, it does not cost anything at all for students. But the only problem with the show is the date which is on Tuesday 14 March from 10.00 to 19.00. As we're considering your programme we're supposed to go to the Science Museum and shopping. We're thinking that we can go to these places the  following day. But Mr. Robertson, these  suggestions depend on your programme, we're just suggesting. Again we're so sorry that we are causing you  inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us. We are looking forward to hearing from you Yours sincerely,
Last week I went to the Circle theatre, for which you are responsible, to see the musical show "Over the Rainbow". The advertisement outside the theatre described a lot of interesting things to enjoy. I am writing this letter because I have had a very disappointing evening. Everything in the advertisement has been done in the Wrong Way. Firstly there was a different actor in the starring role; you had written DANNY BROOK and he was absent. I had attended the show because I like DANNY BROOK a lot, but you had changed the programme. Moreover the advertisement said that the time of the show was 19.30; on the contrary it started  45 minutes  late. Another thing that was wrong is about discounts: you had written they were available, but they were not and so I had to pay the full  price. But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant in the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner.
I think modern technology has changed mankind's life a lot, especially since last century. The changes brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or without a part of it. In my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity : I live on a little mountain at 160 metres  altitude so I cannot go to the city using a bicycle. Because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and I need a good personal computer with a modem and the Internet  to study or do research, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town. Moreover my mother does not let me go out with my friends to the city without a cellular phone because it is too far and she gets worried. Another thing that I appreciate a lot is the electric guitar; I like to play guitar very much, and in my free time I prefer to play electric, than acoustic or classical guitar, using distortion and gain and the highest volume possible.
I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied with it. Lots of information in your advertisement is not correct. Some problems of organisation seem to have appeared.
Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing evening at your  show but that didn't happen. In your advertisement you announced the actors were Danny Brook and Tina Truelove. They were replaced by less famous actors. Unfortunately, the musical  was boring. I was terribly disappointed. Moreover, it started at 20.15 instead of 19.30 as you had written . I had to wait for 45 minutes  doing nothing. I wish you had informed us beforehand.
First of all, as you  know, lots of technology has advanced in a few years. For example, without using the Internet I could not get  through to foreign people. This interactive method of communication allows me to reach everybody everywhere without restrictions. I feel free as an eagle. I can take advantage of such technologies as mobile phones, lap top computers, televisions, to have contact with different cultures.
Do you remember the concert I helped at? It was absolutely amazing. My job was checking the entry tickets and the bags of the fans. We started at 7 pm to let them into the concert area. I had to tear off a part of every single ticket. This part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors. After two hours of tearing tickets I changed my  and went to help at the security section. Here, I had to check the bags and coats of the girls. Fans weren't allowed to take any sharp things in with them, like knives or scissors. So I looked into every bag and found some forbidden things in some of the bags. I really felt like a security guard.
And for me, I think a tent would be better. I don't know why but I feel more comfortable. I think it's because the last time I travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when I was sleeping I felt something moving on my skin, then I woke up frightened and when I opened my eyes, I saw lots of big ants! After that day, I've never stayed in a log cabin. Yeah, I think that's why!
- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become awkward for me.
I spent two days at the last annual international arts festival and I would like to congratulate you on the organization. I am also writing to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion about next year's festival.
Thank you very much for your letter telling me about the first prize. It seems so exciting. I really look forward to taking part in Camp California.
"Shopping is not always enjoyable". I strongly agree with this sentence. I used to go shopping a lot when I was at  university. I was 19 years old but I spent over 200 pounds  some weeks just to keep myself fashionable all the time. I bought lots of new, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. For four years at  university I never had any savings.
I am writing to you in order to describe my last visit to your theatre. Unfortunately, I am  very disappointed about the organisation of your company.
Firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later. I paid for this performance the full price of Â£20 because discounts were not available although in your advertisement they were. And the biggest disappointment for me was that the great Danny Brook, the best singer in London, wasn't present and another unknown person was singing. And last but not least, I found out after the show that your theatre restaurant was closed because waiters didn't come...
I don't know whether it is a typical situation in the Circle Theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but I do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back - my bank account number is enclosed. I am looking forward to your answer.
Secondly, we can do our jobs today more efficiently. We have modern equipment for communication - phones, faxes, E-mail. We can communicate with our clients faster and better and offer them better services. Ordered goods can be delivered in a shorter time by trains, trucks and modern ships. If we are more efficient we can earn more money and spend it more in our daily life - on better clothes, furniture, .
I am a fan of modern technology.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. She's the sister of my ex-girlfriend, who is called Eingrid. She was a really nice person and loved me a lot.  understand why I'm writing about the past.
I am writing on behalf of my class to thank you for the programme you organised for our trip to London. We all think it is a good programme, especially because of the fact that it combines leisure and culture. However, we saw an advertisement for "The London Fashion and Leisure Show" and we would all like to go and see it.
As you are probably aware  our English class is going to spend three days in London. The programme has already been organized by you and I have to say you have drawn up a very nice schedule for us. The river trip to Greenwich is certainly something we are all looking forward to, but because of the London Fashion and Leisure show, my class have asked me to suggest a change in our schedule.
This show consists of a big fair in the Central Exhibition Hall in which we will have the opportunity of seeing the latest releases in sportswear, make up and hairstyles. I believe it could be an enriching experience for all of us. We would have fun, meet the locals and practise our English at the same time. Furthermore, we would be speaking English outside school.
The event will take place on Tuesday, 14th of March, so instead of going to the Science Museum and then going shopping, we could spend the day visiting the show. Our free time on Wednesday could be spent at the museum.
Best Detective Stories by Agatha Christie
I'm sorry it took me so long to write back to you, but I have been very busy lately. Anyway, in your last letter you asked me whether Best Detective Stories by Agatha Christie would be a good present or not for your cousin. Well, having read the book before, I can say it would be a great idea!
Now, tell me more about you. Are you already on holiday? My school has finished, but I'll need to sit a big exam at the end of this month so that I can go to college. My parents and I will spend our holidays in Australia and I just couldn't be happier! I just can't wait to go abroad for the first time!
As we have seen the advertisement for the programme the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of  are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and  the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
It was dangerous, but I knew I had to do it. Even though all of my friends who were with me on that day  said, "Just let it go, it's only a puppy. Why do you have to take a risk?" It seemed that none of them had any sympathy for that lovely blue-eyed puppy that somebody who had no mercy had just left  there, on a highway.
I think the only way of changing that is if the people show no interest because then the journalist would have no reason  to publish any gossip because it would not be watched or read by anyone. So the power is with the people.
We all think the programme is organised well. In particular we're so keen on the idea of going to the National Art Gallery, to see the work of the greatest painters in the world.
The show will be in the Central Exhibition Hall on Tuesday, the 14th of March, from 10.00 pm to 19.00 pm.
I'm wondering if there is any possibility to go to that show on Tuesday afternoon, and move our shopping to the next day.
My story begins during my holiday. It was a nice, hot summer so I and two friends of mine decided to go on holiday this year to the seaside.
I looked around and I realised a friend of mine was still in the sea, and fighting against the storm, trying to get to the shore.
What is more, there were no discounts available on the ticket prices nor had we the opportunity to visit the theatre restaurant, as it was closed for mourning reasons.
Anyway, I don't really mind what people will be wearing in 100 years' time. As for me the only thing I care about in the morning is that I don't have  mismatched socks!
Firstly,  to thank you for organising a good programme in London, especially the visit to the Science Museum and National Art Gallery. We know that it is a good chance for us to learn more different things and we can widen our knowledge in the Science Museum. In addition, we can appreciate and enjoy the art in the National Art Gallery. Unfortunately, I know that most of the students have already visited these two places before. So we decided to choose another event . It is the LONDON FASHION AND LEISURE SHOW. The show will be held at the Central Exhibition Hall, London. The date is  Tuesday March 14, from 10.00-19.00. It shows the latest fashions, including leisure and sports wear. In spite of this, there are also make-up and hairstyles, which .
For me, I think people's homes may not be built on the ground. The homes will be built in the sky - so as to save more land to build the other buildings. As the homes will be built in the sky, it will save a lot of electricity as solar energy will be used.
Regarding electrical goods, there will not be any kind of electrical product except computers. People will do everything on the computer, including watching TV, listening to music, and chatting with people, as the computer is  a multi-functional product.
How has modern technology changed your daily life? The entrance  to the new millennium brought us a lot of changes. Many things have been replaced by  others which are more helpful and useful. The most important thing for me is using a computer. The main advantage is that it provides you with all the information that you need. For example, you have to write an Essay about the 2nd world war. You get on to the Internet and you're looking for those facts and information which will help you to do your homework. Searching in the computer's memory takes about 1 minute so it is very fast. Furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately this fact especially has changed my life.
I'm writing to you because I want to give you my opinion and some suggestions for next year's festival.  I saw in the advertisement there would be stars and artists from around the world but this year there were only six countries represented. It would be better if there were more than six countries.
Firstly I want to congratulate you on the festival. It was a great idea. However there were things that I didn't like. You said that stars and artists would come from around the world but there were only stars from six major countries. I suggest you increase this number for  next year. In this way we can meet other stars and artists, see different cultures. Another thing that I want to point out is, the concert halls are too small. Some people couldn't get into the hall and they missed the concerts. There were some plays and films. They were excellent so can you show more plays next year? The last thing that I will say is "one reasonably-priced weekend ticket"  was a very good idea. I hope you will do the same thing next year.
These are  my suggestions. I hope you will listen to my suggestions. This will make the festival better. I hope we will meet next year at the festival.
"Oh, God" - thought Paul - "the next time I will throw a frog into Pat's rucksack."
Secondly, I would prefer to stay at Camp California, because I have stayed in log cabins before and I didn't enjoy it. This time I want to try something different.
If I had the choice, I would never go shopping in the big supermarkets. You can lose your way if you do not follow the signs, or you can't find the items that you want to buy.
Unfortunately, Pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. This was the reason why we were in horrible trouble with the police. What is more, our friends didn't want to talk to us.
Let's go back to the beginning of this story. I and my friends had a holiday and decided to spend a few days on an "island". We called this place  this, because it was a piece of land in the middle of our lake. We tried to survive there without returning to  land - to our town. There was no light at night so we had to find some wood to make a fire. I was  walking with my friend Pat in a forest when we discovered some gold. This is no joke! There was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank. We found the solution to this desperate situation - to say nothing to anybody. So we tried to keep our secret for 2 days but...
To begin with, we enjoy reading gossip about famous stars and politicians, although they sometimes aren't true. In addition we are fascinated by their marriages, children, holidays etc. What is more it was their own choice to become popular and well known. When choosing this style of life they should realise what their life would be like.
To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars and politicians have a right to one. Otherwise they can suffer  problems, and fall into deep depression.
I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel in July. I can't change  the date I start work because I signed the contract a month ago. I hope that will not cause you problems.
Regarding accommodation, I would prefer to have a log cabin.  It would be better to leave money or anything in without worrying about theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but I have never had the opportunity to try this sport. When I saw that you offer this sport, I was really excited. So I choose climbing as a beginner. For the second activity, I will choose sailing. I've been sailing for more than ten years and I really enjoy it. Moreover I have been a sailing teacher .
Life at school is made of several things. First, lessons are the most important part of what school wants to provide us with. But there are also a lot of clubs and activities that form part of the daily life of pupils. That's why they both have to be taken into account in the video we will make.
As for other activities, we could probably show one of our sports teams training. For example, the basketball team which has won the student regional title (we can also say that) or the football team. After all, it is not important which one we will show, but I think we must create a good picture of the school through sport.
I have already thought about a change to the programme. On Wednesday we could enjoy our free time by going shopping, so on Tuesday afternoon we  have time to go to visit the London Fashion and Leisure Show.
I hope you will take my proposal into  consideration. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. Yours sincerely
It was a fantastic sunny day in August and my friends and I took a day off from work. There were just four of us. We all decided  to have a day by the seaside not far away from Portsmouth. When we got there we were wearing our costumes. We lay on the sand under the sun, we had funny beach volleyball matches, interesting chats, but after two hours there, my friends decided to go swimming. For me, it was a big problem because I had never had swimming lessons  and my friends didn't know about that. I didn't want to tell them because I was sure they would have started laughing at me. So I took the decision to go and join them as well though I knew that it would be dangerous . I waded very slowly through the water and I was very scared but I had to do it because if I didn't go my friends would realize that something was wrong with me. In the end fortunately everything went well as I didn't sink in the sea. After that day, I decided to take up swimming, so that I would have no embarrassments on  future trips to the seaside .
I have recently been to London and I saw the show "Over the Rainbow" at The Circle Theatre. I have to say that it was a very disappointing evening for me. It should have started at 19.30 and it started at 20:15! There were no discounts available and the theatre's restaurant was closed. But the worst thing about "London's newest and best musical show", as you called it, was the absence of Danny Brook. The actor who was "dancing" was horrible. He was making mistakes all the time. In the advertisement, it was written "your perfect evening out". Well, it wasn't perfect! I want you to give me back my money. I hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
It was a Sunday and, as always, Mark was very excited. He was very keen on going to the mountains.
Suddenly, the father stopped and said: "Here we are!" They were near a little house built of wood and began walking. The sun was shining and Mark was really happy to be outside with his family.
Mark was very interested in building small things with John. He was able to make different objects out of wood.
Lastly, could I ask you something? What is the weather like in California? Do I need clothes with long sleeves? How much money should I bring? Can I change money into US dollars there?
I think it is very kind of you to ask me what my preferences are regarding the trip. I ought to let you know that I can only travel in the second week of July, because that is when my winter holidays start. To answer another of your questions, I am more likely to want to stay in a log cabin, considering that I will be two weeks in the camp. They are much more comfortable than tents.
But one night, with the moonlight, they felt encouraged to continue their walk. Pat was a little bit afraid, but Kim convinced her to follow her saying that she knew the street. But, when they heard a scream, they stopped and, when they saw a shadow coming toward them, they started running, hearing a voice saying: "Our secret!"
Then, in the programme I could read about a discount available on the tickets, for  groups, but I couldn't get that. I couldn't have all the things I expected.
That evening was terrible for me and for my friends, so I'm not satisfied with your information and I ask for some money back.
Peter and Sue asked  Francis for some help with their exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them. The last day all the friends went to Pat's home with food, musical instruments, and a tape recorder. Pat was very excited about this. In the afternoon she had phoned   Francis's mother and she told her the secret, then she phoned  her best friend and she spoke about that again; she phoned  many people all  day. Now a lot of people knew the secret but Pat told everyone: "I will tell you a small secret, but don't you speak about it, please!"
What you expect when you go shopping, generally with a friend or two, is to wander around and to look at everything. Having money and being able to spend it on anything you want is brilliant therefore you try to turn it into an enjoyable experience.
I am writing to tell you that the students of my class have seen an advertisement for the London Fashion And Leisure Show.
I suggest that we should move our visit to the Science Museum to Wednesday afternoon . I look forward to hearing from you.
As I knew the techniques to break into a place without being noticed, I should not have been afraid but tonight I had to steal the most precious diamond in the country, which was very well protected.
When I got close to the shop, I checked if anyone was around and luckily nobody was. Then I approached the door slowly, broke the lock and opened the door. However, my adventure was not over yet. There were lasers all over the place,  which I had to be careful of.
Suddenly something went wrong. The alarm was making a noise. I ran towards the diamond, grabbed it, got out quickly, and ran out of the back door. By chance I saw a car waiting for me outside. I got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
Do you know "Radio Head"? It is my favourite group. I was able to have some autographs from them. It's brilliant, isn't it?
